original Goldtop stylings through Juniors, Specials, Customs, Deluxes, and more. And as one of the most remade and reissued guitars to ever exist, there are many modern versions of the vintage classics.', "Let's take a look at some prime examples of vintage Les Pauls, starting from the 1952 originals through the 1970s. You can also find links to standard production and Custom Shop models from recent years that pay homage to the specific vintage models.", 'Need a hand finding the right Les Paul for you? Visit our Les Paul Buying Guide.', "The Les Paul that started it all. Upon its introduction, the new model sported a pair of single-coil P90 pickups, a clumsy trapeze tailpiece, and a mahogany slab body with a curved maple top. Les Paul himself endorsed a solid gold finish to make the guitar appear high-end and luxurious when compared to Fender's more utilitarian Telecaster, released the year before.", "Modern alternatives: Gibson Les Paul '52 Tribute, Custom Shop Historic Collection '52 Les Paul Goldtop Reissue.", 'While Les Paul was a well-known innovator often credited with the development of the solidbody guitar itself, his contribution to the new model remains controversial. He did have some say in the selection of woods as well as the trapeze bridge, though most of the actual design was spearheaded by Gibson chief Ted McCarty. By early 1953, a new combination wraparound bridge-tailpiece replaced the original trapeze design.', "In conjunction with the evolution of the tailpiece, Gibson's engineers also gradually increased the depth of Les Paul's neck angle. This change improved the action of the instrument by allowing easier adjustment of the bridge. By 1954, Gibson had expanded the Les Paul line with the student-level Les Paul Junior and the top-of-the-line Les Paul Custom.", "Modern alternatives: 1954 Les Paul Goldtop Reissue, Les Paul Standard '50s P90 (with tailpiece and Tune-O-Matic instead of wraparound bridge).", "Like the Goldtop, the Les Paul Custom's tuxedo-like cosmetics were meant to look high-end, earning this model the nickname Black Beauty. The Custom differed from the Standard in its use of multi-ply binding, square inlays on an ebony fingerboard, gold-plated parts and comparatively low frets. The Custom also did not incorporate a maple top in its body as the Standard did. This model was the first to use the new stopbar tailpiece and Tune-O-Matic bridge, an innovation closely associated with Ted McCarty, which was added to the standard in 1955.", 'To complement the higher-end Les Paul and Les Paul Custom, Gibson also introduced two student-level Les Paul models in the \'50s: the Les Paul Junior and Les Paul Special. These guitars lacked the curved maple cap of their more expensive counterparts, and used a more Telecaster-like slab body style. While the Junior packed just one P90, the Special sported two. The other main difference is that the Special had a snazzy TV Yellow finish, while the Junior offered a more traditional sunburst (though a yellow version of the Junior was also produced as the "TV Model").', "Modern alternatives: Les Paul Special, Les Paul Special Tribute P90, Custom Shop '57 Les Paul Special Reissue TV Yellow, 1956 Les Paul Goldtop Reissue, Custom Shop Historic '56 Les Paul Goldtop Reissue.", 'The introduction of the stopbar tailpiece and Tune-O-Matic bridge brought the Les Paul close to the format of the modern Les Paul. The addition of the Seth Lover-designed "Patent Applied For," or PAF, humbuckers elevated the Les Paul to a status of all-time icon. By connecting two pickup coils in series and out-of-phase, Lover and Gibson sought to combat the common 60-cycle hum of conventional pickups. This innovation also fostered a beefier new tone that would be embraced by rock musicians for decades to come.', "Modern alternatives: Les Paul Standard '50s Goldtop, Les Paul Studio '50s Tribute with Humbuckers, Custom Shop 50th Anniversary '57 Les Paul Goldtop.", 'Like the Les Paul Standard, the Les Paul Custom received the humbucker makeover in 1957. The Custom, however, packed three humbuckers instead of two (though some examples maintained the traditional two pickup configuration). In 1958, Gibson switched from Kluson tuners to Grover Rotomatics for the Custom.', 'Modern alternatives: 1957 Les Paul Custom Reissue 3-Pickup, Epiphone Joe Bonamassa Black Beauty Les Paul Custom Outfit.', 'Much like the Les Paul Special, the Les Paul Junior began life as a single-cutaway, lower-end Les Paul-shaped guitar. Neither model made the jump to humbuckers and continued to use the single-piece bridge/tailpiece instead of the Tune-O-Matic. In mid-1958, both models changed to a double-cutaway body shape, which was replaced by the SG body shape in 1961.', "Modern alternatives: Les Paul Junior Tribute, Custom Shop '58 Les Paul Junior Double Cut Reissue, Custom Shop Historic Collection '58 Les Paul Junior Double Cut.", 'In the fall of 1958, Gibson abandoned the original Goldtop finish in favor of a new Cherry Sunburst. The "Burst" Les Pauls of late 1958 to late 1960 remain atop the list of the most collectible guitars ever made. The 1960 model, in particular, is known for having a slimmer neck, leading many modern Gibson models to either replicate the slim \'60s neck profile or the fatter \'50s neck profile.', "Modern alternatives: Les Paul Standard '50s, Les Paul Standard '60s, Les Paul Standard (1990 - 2001), Les Paul Standard with '60s Neck Profile, Custom Shop 60th Anniversary '59 Les Paul Standard Reissue, Custom Shop Special Order '59 Les Paul Standard Reissue, Custom Shop Standard Historic '59 Les Paul Standard (2013 - 2017), Custom Shop Historic '59 Les Paul Standard Reissue (2020), Custom Shop Special Order '60 Les Paul Standard Reissue, Custom Shop Standard Historic '60 Les Paul Standard Reissue (2013 - 2017), Custom Shop 60th Anniversary '60 Les Paul Standard Reissue.", 'By the close of 1960, sales of Gibson\'s flagship solidbody, the Les Paul, were waning. While maintaining the Les Paul moniker, Gibson designers completely changed the model\'s body shape with two sharp cutaways and beveled edges. Gibson retained the dual humbucker configuration (with original PAF humbuckers up until 1962) and implemented a new vibrato system with a lever that pulls to the side. This body shape would eventually be known as the SG for "solid guitar," and today, this is most often referred to as the first SG, but in 1961, it was technically a Les Paul.', "Modern alternatives: SG Standard '61, Gibson SG Standard '61 with Maestro Vibrola, '61 SG Reissue, Custom Shop '61 Les Paul SG Standard Reissue, Custom Shop '61 Les Paul SG Standard Reissue with Vibrola, Custom Shop 60th Anniversary '61 Les Paul SG Standard, '61 SG / Les Paul Reissue with Deluxe Vibrola (1999 - 2002).", 'Like the Les Paul Standard, the Les Paul Custom also made the leap to the SG body shape by 1961. Apart from the body shape and finish, the original SG-style Les Paul Custom shared much with its single-cutaway predecessor. Both models featured block inlays on the fingerboard with the unique diamond headstock inlay design. These guitars also used a triple set of humbucker pickups which changed from PAF (Patent Applied For) humbuckers to Patent Number pickups in mid-1962.', "Modern alternatives: Custom Shop 60th Anniversary '61 Les Paul SG Custom, Custom Shop '63 Les Paul SG Custom Reissue with Maestro, Custom Shop Murphy Lab '63 Les Paul SG Custom Reissue, '61 / '62 SG Custom Reissue (1987-1991).", "The Les Paul Junior and its two-pickup counterpart, the Les Paul Special, both switched to the SG body shape after a stint with a double cutaway slab body shape in the '50s that was not used on the Standard and Custom. According to most accounts, Les Paul himself was never happy with the SG body style, which prompted the removal of his name from the model in 1963.", "Modern alternatives: SG Junior, SG Junior '60s, Custom Shop '63 SG Junior Reissue Lightning Bar, Custom Shop Brian Ray '62 SG Junior.", "After the Les Paul name was dropped and the SG name was introduced, no Les Pauls were produced until 1968, when interest in the original Les Pauls of the '50s was on the rise. When Gibson first brought back the Les Paul Standard, the new model was most similar to the 1956 model, with a Goldtop finish and two P90 pickups instead of humbuckers. These guitars can be seen as the first Les Paul reissues. The original '68 models are very close to the '50s Les Paul, save for a few details, such as Indian instead of Brazilian Rosewood for the fingerboard and chrome instead of nickel hardware.", 'Modern alternative: 1968 Les Paul Standard Goldtop Reissue.', 'Like the Les Paul Standard, Gibson brought back the Les Paul Custom in 1968. This model was also very similar to its \'50s counterparts, but featured a maple top on the mahogany body, where most \'50s Customs used all-mahogany bodies. Both of these reissue models changed through 1969 with the introduction of a three-ply "pancake body" and a three-piece laminated mahogany neck with a volute (a small bump) where the neck meets the headstock. For collectors, these changes all signify a steady departure from the pinnacle designs of the \'50s and the beginning of a general decline in quality that would continue into the \'70s.', "Modern alternatives: Les Paul Custom, Les Paul Custom (1990-2011), Custom Shop '68 Les Paul Custom Reissue.", 'The pancake-style body—a four-ply body construction style with two plies of mahogany, a thin ply of maple, and a maple top—continued until 1977. In this era, Gibson started producing the Custom in new finishes including the Cherry Sunburst seen above.', 'Starting in 1969, Gibson\'s main production Les Paul was dubbed the Les Paul Deluxe. The Les Paul Deluxe differed from the original Standard in its use of mini-humbuckers instead of PAFs, and its use of the four-ply "pancake" body style. The Les Paul Standard was not actually brought back to the Gibson catalog until 1976. Between 1972 and 1975, you could special order a Les Paul Deluxe with normal-sized humbuckers and the word "Standard" on the truss-rod cover; for all intents and purposes, these Deluxes were Les Paul Standards even if not on paper.', "Modern alternatives: Les Paul '70s Deluxe, Les Paul Deluxe 30th Anniversary, Les Paul Deluxe (2004-2005), Les Paul Deluxe 2015.", 'Perhaps the strangest new Les Pauls brought about in this era are the Les Paul Professional, Personal, and Recording (pictured). In 1969, the Les Paul Personal and Professional launched with new low-impedance oblong pickups and an onboard phase switch. The Personal was the higher-end of the two, featuring gold-plated hardware and multi-ply binding like a Les Paul Custom. Both models were replaced by the Les Paul Recording in 1971, which introduced a high/low impedance switch with internal transistor. This guitar was considered a personal favorite of Les Paul himself.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Founders of new musical genres. Pioneers in experimental electronic music. Throbbing Gristle were all of these things and much more.', 'The group was born from the ashes of performance group COUM Transmissions and founded in 1975 by Genesis P-Orridge, Cosey Fanni Tutti, Chris Carter, and Peter "Sleazy" Christopherson. Over a period of five years, Throbbing Gristle released a series of uncompromising records that they called "industrial music." Their sound was unique, synthetic, effects-heavy, and often terrifying—a blueprint that would go on to inspire hundreds of future groups.', 'A lot of mystery still surrounds the machines behind the music of Throbbing Gristle. Although much of their equipment was store-bought and used by a lot of their contemporaries, there were a few key differences that ensured they didn’t really sound like anyone else.', 'Even today, with so much past music being faultlessly recreated, their records are still largely unfathomable. This is due in large part to Chris Carter’s electronics knowledge, which enabled him to build, modify, and otherwise develop original instruments and effects.', 'In this piece, we’ll look at the equipment that Throbbing Gristle used in their first iteration (roughly the period from 1976-1981), including Carter’s unique creations and modifications.', 'Although Throbbing Gristle (TG) basically used the same instruments as everyone else—vocals, guitar, bass, and synthesizers—what set them apart was the way they processed everything with effects. Effects were not new in the late ‘70s, of course, but TG employed them almost as if each was an instrument in itself.', 'First and foremost, TG wouldn’t be TG without the Gristleizer—a homemade effects unit based around Roy Gwinn’s Guitar Effects Pedal circuit first published in Practical Electronics magazine in July of 1975. A half-rack box covered in Tolex, it had knobs for speed, depth, LFO shape, bias, and amount of effect. It also had a switch to change between VCF and VCA, and a power switch. It was powered by batteries.', '"The basic unit was a voltage-controlled filter and voltage-controlled amp with an LFO," Carter told Sound On Sound in 2015. "But you could only switch between one or the other, it had to be either a VCF or a VCA, and then it had various waveforms for the LFO. Whatever you put through it at line level, it would modulate the sound to the speed of the LFO. You could overdrive it quite easily, so it had that sort of fizzy distortion sound along with this modulation."', 'Every member had at least one Gristleizer at hand, with Genesis and Carter both using two. "The beauty of the Gristleizers was that its range of sounds was so extreme, which also meant it could sound completely different depending on the instrument," Carter explained to Planet Origo in 2004.', '"The sounds included slow modulated filtering, a metallic ring-modulation effect, clipped and fuzzed distortion, and tremolo. At the time, there was no other battery-powered effect unit capable of such a wide and weird range of sounds." The Gristleizer was later made into a Eurorack module by Future Sound Systems working with Chris Carter and Roy Gwinn.', 'Eventide Harmonizers—particularly the HM80—were also a core part of the TG sound. Each member had an effects chain that started with a Gristleizer and then passed through a Harmonizer. This would then be fed into a tape echo, likely a Roland RE-201 (the band had two), a Watkins Copicat, and later a Roland Chorus Echo SRE-555. TG were also known to use more typical stompbox effects as well, like various fuzzes, a flanger (such as the Boss BF-2), phase, wah-wah, and chorus (particularly the Boss CE-2).', 'The core of the electronic sound of TG was made with a hybrid Roland System 100m rig. Carter worked with a combination of Roland modules and Digisound kits that he modified and painted to fit into the Roland racks. The system expanded throughout TG’s first period (as modular systems tend to do!), but his main system was comprised of 191-J and 190 racks, a 112 dual VCO, 110 VCO/VCF/VCA combo unit, a 140 dual envelope and LFO unit, and a 182 sequencer.', 'Later he added another 182, a 172 phase/delay, a 121 dual VCF, a 130 VCA, and 131 mixer. To this he added a dozen or so Digisound modules, which included VCAs, VCFs, envelope generators, envelope followers, and ring modulators.', 'Carter was a Roland fan, and his rig also included a Roland SH-3A, SH-1, SH-5, SH-7, and SH-2. The SH-3A can be heard on "AB/7A" on D.o.A.: the Third and Final Report, sequenced by a Roland Model 104—the analog sequencer from the System 100 (which was apparently Carter’s only piece of gear from the famous system).', 'Now, about that tape machine. While it’s true that professional samplers did exist in the late ‘70s (the Fairlight CMI was released in 1979), true to form, TG built their own (although in a decidedly analog and low-tech way).', 'Where Genesis sang and played bass, Cosey handled guitar and trumpet duties, and Chris was the mad synthesist, Sleazy preferred to work with tape. He returned from a trip to New York with four new Sony Walkmans, and with these, he and Carter created a kind of proto-sampler.', '"We sat down and figured out a way that we could trigger the tapes from a keyboard," Carter explained in the same interview with Sound On Sound. "I had a small one-octave keyboard, and I put relays on it, so by playing the keyboard he could switch them on and off with his fingers." Sleazy used this to trigger secretly recorded conversations, bits of audio from TV and radio, and tape loops made by Carter on his modular rig.', 'Less exciting but no less important to the sound of TG was the gear behind the gear: the mixers, microphones, and tape decks used to record the albums.', 'As befitting a group that was more concerned with sonic exploration than pristine sound, they used a slapdash mixer system that evolved over the years and included a Soundcraft, Tascam, Boss KM-4, and two Seck mixers chained together. For microphones, Genesis preferred Shure SM58s, likely for their durability. They used these on their amps as well.', 'TG operated out of their own studio, which they called The Death Factory. They didn’t own their own tape deck and would rent them as needed. Because Sleazy was on the staff at Hipgnosis, the design company famous for working with Pink Floyd, the band often rented Studer 2-inch 16-track tape machines from Floyd’s Britannia Row studio. From wreckers of civilization to associates of Pink Floyd.', 'Throbbing Gristle broke up in 1981, and Genesis and Sleazy soon formed Psychic TV, with Sleazy later forming Coil with John Balance. Chris and Cosey continued on making music as well. The four reunited in 2004, releasing new music and touring. Sleazy passed away in 2010, ending the band, and Genesis passed away in 2020.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/news/potent-pairings-how-to-sound-like-blur'], ["Few musical genres have had the effect that Britpop had in the UK in the 1990s. Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/news/potent-pairings-how-to-sound-like-blur'], ["Few musical genres have had the effect that Britpop had in the UK in the 1990s. Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/news/potent-pairings-how-to-sound-like-blur'], ["Few musical genres have had the effect that Britpop had in the UK in the 1990s. Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/news/potent-pairings-how-to-sound-like-blur'], ["Few musical genres have had the effect that Britpop had in the UK in the 1990s. Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/news/potent-pairings-how-to-sound-like-blur'], ["Few musical genres have had the effect that Britpop had in the UK in the 1990s. Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/news/potent-pairings-how-to-sound-like-blur'], ["Few musical genres have had the effect that Britpop had in the UK in the 1990s. Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/news/potent-pairings-how-to-sound-like-blur'], ["Few musical genres have had the effect that Britpop had in the UK in the 1990s. Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/news/potent-pairings-how-to-sound-like-blur'], ["Few musical genres have had the effect that Britpop had in the UK in the 1990s. Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/news/potent-pairings-how-to-sound-like-blur'], ["Few musical genres have had the effect that Britpop had in the UK in the 1990s. Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/news/potent-pairings-how-to-sound-like-blur'], ["Few musical genres have had the effect that Britpop had in the UK in the 1990s. Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/news/potent-pairings-how-to-sound-like-blur'], ["Few musical genres have had the effect that Britpop had in the UK in the 1990s. Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/news/potent-pairings-how-to-sound-like-blur'], ["Few musical genres have had the effect that Britpop had in the UK in the 1990s. Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/news/potent-pairings-how-to-sound-like-blur'], ["Few musical genres have had the effect that Britpop had in the UK in the 1990s. Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/news/potent-pairings-how-to-sound-like-blur'], ["Few musical genres have had the effect that Britpop had in the UK in the 1990s. Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/news/potent-pairings-how-to-sound-like-blur'], ["Few musical genres have had the effect that Britpop had in the UK in the 1990s. Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/news/potent-pairings-how-to-sound-like-blur'], ["Few musical genres have had the effect that Britpop had in the UK in the 1990s. Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/news/potent-pairings-how-to-sound-like-blur'], ["Few musical genres have had the effect that Britpop had in the UK in the 1990s. Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/news/potent-pairings-how-to-sound-like-blur'], ["Few musical genres have had the effect that Britpop had in the UK in the 1990s. Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/news/potent-pairings-how-to-sound-like-blur'], ["Few musical genres have had the effect that Britpop had in the UK in the 1990s. Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/news/potent-pairings-how-to-sound-like-blur'], ["Few musical genres have had the effect that Britpop had in the UK in the 1990s. Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

original Goldtop stylings through Juniors, Specials, Customs, Deluxes, and more. And as one of the most remade and reissued guitars to ever exist, there are many modern versions of the vintage classics.', "Let's take a look at some prime examples of vintage Les Pauls, starting from the 1952 originals through the 1970s. You can also find links to standard production and Custom Shop models from recent years that pay homage to the specific vintage models.", 'Need a hand finding the right Les Paul for you? Visit our Les Paul Buying Guide.', "The Les Paul that started it all. Upon its introduction, the new model sported a pair of single-coil P90 pickups, a clumsy trapeze tailpiece, and a mahogany slab body with a curved maple top. Les Paul himself endorsed a solid gold finish to make the guitar appear high-end and luxurious when compared to Fender's more utilitarian Telecaster, released the year before.", "Modern alternatives: Gibson Les Paul '52 Tribute, Custom Shop Historic Collection '52 Les Paul Goldtop Reissue.", 'While Les Paul was a well-known innovator often credited with the development of the solidbody guitar itself, his contribution to the new model remains controversial. He did have some say in the selection of woods as well as the trapeze bridge, though most of the actual design was spearheaded by Gibson chief Ted McCarty. By early 1953, a new combination wraparound bridge-tailpiece replaced the original trapeze design.', "In conjunction with the evolution of the tailpiece, Gibson's engineers also gradually increased the depth of Les Paul's neck angle. This change improved the action of the instrument by allowing easier adjustment of the bridge. By 1954, Gibson had expanded the Les Paul line with the student-level Les Paul Junior and the top-of-the-line Les Paul Custom.", "Modern alternatives: 1954 Les Paul Goldtop Reissue, Les Paul Standard '50s P90 (with tailpiece and Tune-O-Matic instead of wraparound bridge).", "Like the Goldtop, the Les Paul Custom's tuxedo-like cosmetics were meant to look high-end, earning this model the nickname Black Beauty. The Custom differed from the Standard in its use of multi-ply binding, square inlays on an ebony fingerboard, gold-plated parts and comparatively low frets. The Custom also did not incorporate a maple top in its body as the Standard did. This model was the first to use the new stopbar tailpiece and Tune-O-Matic bridge, an innovation closely associated with Ted McCarty, which was added to the standard in 1955.", 'To complement the higher-end Les Paul and Les Paul Custom, Gibson also introduced two student-level Les Paul models in the \'50s: the Les Paul Junior and Les Paul Special. These guitars lacked the curved maple cap of their more expensive counterparts, and used a more Telecaster-like slab body style. While the Junior packed just one P90, the Special sported two. The other main difference is that the Special had a snazzy TV Yellow finish, while the Junior offered a more traditional sunburst (though a yellow version of the Junior was also produced as the "TV Model").', "Modern alternatives: Les Paul Special, Les Paul Special Tribute P90, Custom Shop '57 Les Paul Special Reissue TV Yellow, 1956 Les Paul Goldtop Reissue, Custom Shop Historic '56 Les Paul Goldtop Reissue.", 'The introduction of the stopbar tailpiece and Tune-O-Matic bridge brought the Les Paul close to the format of the modern Les Paul. The addition of the Seth Lover-designed "Patent Applied For," or PAF, humbuckers elevated the Les Paul to a status of all-time icon. By connecting two pickup coils in series and out-of-phase, Lover and Gibson sought to combat the common 60-cycle hum of conventional pickups. This innovation also fostered a beefier new tone that would be embraced by rock musicians for decades to come.', "Modern alternatives: Les Paul Standard '50s Goldtop, Les Paul Studio '50s Tribute with Humbuckers, Custom Shop 50th Anniversary '57 Les Paul Goldtop.", 'Like the Les Paul Standard, the Les Paul Custom received the humbucker makeover in 1957. The Custom, however, packed three humbuckers instead of two (though some examples maintained the traditional two pickup configuration). In 1958, Gibson switched from Kluson tuners to Grover Rotomatics for the Custom.', 'Modern alternatives: 1957 Les Paul Custom Reissue 3-Pickup, Epiphone Joe Bonamassa Black Beauty Les Paul Custom Outfit.', 'Much like the Les Paul Special, the Les Paul Junior began life as a single-cutaway, lower-end Les Paul-shaped guitar. Neither model made the jump to humbuckers and continued to use the single-piece bridge/tailpiece instead of the Tune-O-Matic. In mid-1958, both models changed to a double-cutaway body shape, which was replaced by the SG body shape in 1961.', "Modern alternatives: Les Paul Junior Tribute, Custom Shop '58 Les Paul Junior Double Cut Reissue, Custom Shop Historic Collection '58 Les Paul Junior Double Cut.", 'In the fall of 1958, Gibson abandoned the original Goldtop finish in favor of a new Cherry Sunburst. The "Burst" Les Pauls of late 1958 to late 1960 remain atop the list of the most collectible guitars ever made. The 1960 model, in particular, is known for having a slimmer neck, leading many modern Gibson models to either replicate the slim \'60s neck profile or the fatter \'50s neck profile.', "Modern alternatives: Les Paul Standard '50s, Les Paul Standard '60s, Les Paul Standard (1990 - 2001), Les Paul Standard with '60s Neck Profile, Custom Shop 60th Anniversary '59 Les Paul Standard Reissue, Custom Shop Special Order '59 Les Paul Standard Reissue, Custom Shop Standard Historic '59 Les Paul Standard (2013 - 2017), Custom Shop Historic '59 Les Paul Standard Reissue (2020), Custom Shop Special Order '60 Les Paul Standard Reissue, Custom Shop Standard Historic '60 Les Paul Standard Reissue (2013 - 2017), Custom Shop 60th Anniversary '60 Les Paul Standard Reissue.", 'By the close of 1960, sales of Gibson\'s flagship solidbody, the Les Paul, were waning. While maintaining the Les Paul moniker, Gibson designers completely changed the model\'s body shape with two sharp cutaways and beveled edges. Gibson retained the dual humbucker configuration (with original PAF humbuckers up until 1962) and implemented a new vibrato system with a lever that pulls to the side. This body shape would eventually be known as the SG for "solid guitar," and today, this is most often referred to as the first SG, but in 1961, it was technically a Les Paul.', "Modern alternatives: SG Standard '61, Gibson SG Standard '61 with Maestro Vibrola, '61 SG Reissue, Custom Shop '61 Les Paul SG Standard Reissue, Custom Shop '61 Les Paul SG Standard Reissue with Vibrola, Custom Shop 60th Anniversary '61 Les Paul SG Standard, '61 SG / Les Paul Reissue with Deluxe Vibrola (1999 - 2002).", 'Like the Les Paul Standard, the Les Paul Custom also made the leap to the SG body shape by 1961. Apart from the body shape and finish, the original SG-style Les Paul Custom shared much with its single-cutaway predecessor. Both models featured block inlays on the fingerboard with the unique diamond headstock inlay design. These guitars also used a triple set of humbucker pickups which changed from PAF (Patent Applied For) humbuckers to Patent Number pickups in mid-1962.', "Modern alternatives: Custom Shop 60th Anniversary '61 Les Paul SG Custom, Custom Shop '63 Les Paul SG Custom Reissue with Maestro, Custom Shop Murphy Lab '63 Les Paul SG Custom Reissue, '61 / '62 SG Custom Reissue (1987-1991).", "The Les Paul Junior and its two-pickup counterpart, the Les Paul Special, both switched to the SG body shape after a stint with a double cutaway slab body shape in the '50s that was not used on the Standard and Custom. According to most accounts, Les Paul himself was never happy with the SG body style, which prompted the removal of his name from the model in 1963.", "Modern alternatives: SG Junior, SG Junior '60s, Custom Shop '63 SG Junior Reissue Lightning Bar, Custom Shop Brian Ray '62 SG Junior.", "After the Les Paul name was dropped and the SG name was introduced, no Les Pauls were produced until 1968, when interest in the original Les Pauls of the '50s was on the rise. When Gibson first brought back the Les Paul Standard, the new model was most similar to the 1956 model, with a Goldtop finish and two P90 pickups instead of humbuckers. These guitars can be seen as the first Les Paul reissues. The original '68 models are very close to the '50s Les Paul, save for a few details, such as Indian instead of Brazilian Rosewood for the fingerboard and chrome instead of nickel hardware.", 'Modern alternative: 1968 Les Paul Standard Goldtop Reissue.', 'Like the Les Paul Standard, Gibson brought back the Les Paul Custom in 1968. This model was also very similar to its \'50s counterparts, but featured a maple top on the mahogany body, where most \'50s Customs used all-mahogany bodies. Both of these reissue models changed through 1969 with the introduction of a three-ply "pancake body" and a three-piece laminated mahogany neck with a volute (a small bump) where the neck meets the headstock. For collectors, these changes all signify a steady departure from the pinnacle designs of the \'50s and the beginning of a general decline in quality that would continue into the \'70s.', "Modern alternatives: Les Paul Custom, Les Paul Custom (1990-2011), Custom Shop '68 Les Paul Custom Reissue.", 'The pancake-style body—a four-ply body construction style with two plies of mahogany, a thin ply of maple, and a maple top—continued until 1977. In this era, Gibson started producing the Custom in new finishes including the Cherry Sunburst seen above.', 'Starting in 1969, Gibson\'s main production Les Paul was dubbed the Les Paul Deluxe. The Les Paul Deluxe differed from the original Standard in its use of mini-humbuckers instead of PAFs, and its use of the four-ply "pancake" body style. The Les Paul Standard was not actually brought back to the Gibson catalog until 1976. Between 1972 and 1975, you could special order a Les Paul Deluxe with normal-sized humbuckers and the word "Standard" on the truss-rod cover; for all intents and purposes, these Deluxes were Les Paul Standards even if not on paper.', "Modern alternatives: Les Paul '70s Deluxe, Les Paul Deluxe 30th Anniversary, Les Paul Deluxe (2004-2005), Les Paul Deluxe 2015.", 'Perhaps the strangest new Les Pauls brought about in this era are the Les Paul Professional, Personal, and Recording (pictured). In 1969, the Les Paul Personal and Professional launched with new low-impedance oblong pickups and an onboard phase switch. The Personal was the higher-end of the two, featuring gold-plated hardware and multi-ply binding like a Les Paul Custom. Both models were replaced by the Les Paul Recording in 1971, which introduced a high/low impedance switch with internal transistor. This guitar was considered a personal favorite of Les Paul himself.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Founders of new musical genres. Pioneers in experimental electronic music. Throbbing Gristle were all of these things and much more.', 'The group was born from the ashes of performance group COUM Transmissions and founded in 1975 by Genesis P-Orridge, Cosey Fanni Tutti, Chris Carter, and Peter "Sleazy" Christopherson. Over a period of five years, Throbbing Gristle released a series of uncompromising records that they called "industrial music." Their sound was unique, synthetic, effects-heavy, and often terrifying—a blueprint that would go on to inspire hundreds of future groups.', 'A lot of mystery still surrounds the machines behind the music of Throbbing Gristle. Although much of their equipment was store-bought and used by a lot of their contemporaries, there were a few key differences that ensured they didn’t really sound like anyone else.', 'Even today, with so much past music being faultlessly recreated, their records are still largely unfathomable. This is due in large part to Chris Carter’s electronics knowledge, which enabled him to build, modify, and otherwise develop original instruments and effects.', 'In this piece, we’ll look at the equipment that Throbbing Gristle used in their first iteration (roughly the period from 1976-1981), including Carter’s unique creations and modifications.', 'Although Throbbing Gristle (TG) basically used the same instruments as everyone else—vocals, guitar, bass, and synthesizers—what set them apart was the way they processed everything with effects. Effects were not new in the late ‘70s, of course, but TG employed them almost as if each was an instrument in itself.', 'First and foremost, TG wouldn’t be TG without the Gristleizer—a homemade effects unit based around Roy Gwinn’s Guitar Effects Pedal circuit first published in Practical Electronics magazine in July of 1975. A half-rack box covered in Tolex, it had knobs for speed, depth, LFO shape, bias, and amount of effect. It also had a switch to change between VCF and VCA, and a power switch. It was powered by batteries.', '"The basic unit was a voltage-controlled filter and voltage-controlled amp with an LFO," Carter told Sound On Sound in 2015. "But you could only switch between one or the other, it had to be either a VCF or a VCA, and then it had various waveforms for the LFO. Whatever you put through it at line level, it would modulate the sound to the speed of the LFO. You could overdrive it quite easily, so it had that sort of fizzy distortion sound along with this modulation."', 'Every member had at least one Gristleizer at hand, with Genesis and Carter both using two. "The beauty of the Gristleizers was that its range of sounds was so extreme, which also meant it could sound completely different depending on the instrument," Carter explained to Planet Origo in 2004.', '"The sounds included slow modulated filtering, a metallic ring-modulation effect, clipped and fuzzed distortion, and tremolo. At the time, there was no other battery-powered effect unit capable of such a wide and weird range of sounds." The Gristleizer was later made into a Eurorack module by Future Sound Systems working with Chris Carter and Roy Gwinn.', 'Eventide Harmonizers—particularly the HM80—were also a core part of the TG sound. Each member had an effects chain that started with a Gristleizer and then passed through a Harmonizer. This would then be fed into a tape echo, likely a Roland RE-201 (the band had two), a Watkins Copicat, and later a Roland Chorus Echo SRE-555. TG were also known to use more typical stompbox effects as well, like various fuzzes, a flanger (such as the Boss BF-2), phase, wah-wah, and chorus (particularly the Boss CE-2).', 'The core of the electronic sound of TG was made with a hybrid Roland System 100m rig. Carter worked with a combination of Roland modules and Digisound kits that he modified and painted to fit into the Roland racks. The system expanded throughout TG’s first period (as modular systems tend to do!), but his main system was comprised of 191-J and 190 racks, a 112 dual VCO, 110 VCO/VCF/VCA combo unit, a 140 dual envelope and LFO unit, and a 182 sequencer.', 'Later he added another 182, a 172 phase/delay, a 121 dual VCF, a 130 VCA, and 131 mixer. To this he added a dozen or so Digisound modules, which included VCAs, VCFs, envelope generators, envelope followers, and ring modulators.', 'Carter was a Roland fan, and his rig also included a Roland SH-3A, SH-1, SH-5, SH-7, and SH-2. The SH-3A can be heard on "AB/7A" on D.o.A.: the Third and Final Report, sequenced by a Roland Model 104—the analog sequencer from the System 100 (which was apparently Carter’s only piece of gear from the famous system).', 'Now, about that tape machine. While it’s true that professional samplers did exist in the late ‘70s (the Fairlight CMI was released in 1979), true to form, TG built their own (although in a decidedly analog and low-tech way).', 'Where Genesis sang and played bass, Cosey handled guitar and trumpet duties, and Chris was the mad synthesist, Sleazy preferred to work with tape. He returned from a trip to New York with four new Sony Walkmans, and with these, he and Carter created a kind of proto-sampler.', '"We sat down and figured out a way that we could trigger the tapes from a keyboard," Carter explained in the same interview with Sound On Sound. "I had a small one-octave keyboard, and I put relays on it, so by playing the keyboard he could switch them on and off with his fingers." Sleazy used this to trigger secretly recorded conversations, bits of audio from TV and radio, and tape loops made by Carter on his modular rig.', 'Less exciting but no less important to the sound of TG was the gear behind the gear: the mixers, microphones, and tape decks used to record the albums.', 'As befitting a group that was more concerned with sonic exploration than pristine sound, they used a slapdash mixer system that evolved over the years and included a Soundcraft, Tascam, Boss KM-4, and two Seck mixers chained together. For microphones, Genesis preferred Shure SM58s, likely for their durability. They used these on their amps as well.', 'TG operated out of their own studio, which they called The Death Factory. They didn’t own their own tape deck and would rent them as needed. Because Sleazy was on the staff at Hipgnosis, the design company famous for working with Pink Floyd, the band often rented Studer 2-inch 16-track tape machines from Floyd’s Britannia Row studio. From wreckers of civilization to associates of Pink Floyd.', 'Throbbing Gristle broke up in 1981, and Genesis and Sleazy soon formed Psychic TV, with Sleazy later forming Coil with John Balance. Chris and Cosey continued on making music as well. The four reunited in 2004, releasing new music and touring. Sleazy passed away in 2010, ending the band, and Genesis passed away in 2020.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Each of the eight episodes chronicles an event, musical tool, group, trend, etc. that defined a moment in pop music history. Right away, I couldn\'t resist the second episode, "Auto-Tune," featuring T-Pain on the episode cover.', 'Although T-Pain did not invent Auto-Tune, nor was he even close to the first musician to have used it, Auto-Tune is undeniably what he became known for in the early 2000s. Why? Because he used the pitch-correcting software as a creative tool in itself, rather than as a corrective crutch.', '"You can write the history of electronic music as \'the creative misuse of available tools,\'" says musician and writer Jace Clayton later on in the episode. It\'s a perfectly articulated statement, but one I\'d take a few steps further.', 'The history of some of the most impactful music innovations in general have their roots in creative misuses, malfunctioning equipment, and happy accidents. A broken mixing board eventually spawned the fuzz pedal; "misusing" turntables begets DJing and early hip-hop; the result of overdriven, inefficient speakers in early tube amps becomes a must-have feature in modern gear—the list goes on.', 'Inspired by This Is Pop, we\'re going to dig into just a few examples of when using gear the "wrong" way led to the right result.', 'In the mid-\'90s, seismic data processing engineer Andy Hildebrand was at a luncheon when his colleague\'s wife, a singer, offhandedly requested that Hildebrand make her "a box that would have me sing in-tune." In 1996, Auto-Tune was born.', '"There were other attempts to do what I did," Hildebrand says in This Is Pop, "but those efforts were doomed because the practitioners didn\'t understand the issues." While the specifics of those complexities are too abstract to dive into, it comes down to the fact that Hildebrand uniquely understood the math of the problem because of his background.', 'Seismic data processing is a discipline used to locate oil by way of sound. Dynamite is detonated into the ground and geophones are used to listen to the reverberations that come back, which helps engineers determine the location of oil. "Mathematically, it\'s like going out in the rain during a thunderstorm, closing your eyes, and because of the rolling sound of the thunder, figuring out the shape of the clouds."', 'Hildebrand\'s understanding of these systems, of seismic data as sound, is what allowed him to tackle the complex problems of pitch-correction. "I knew pretty much how to do it right away, technically, because a lot of the work I had done related to those issues."', "Although Hildebrand, a non-musician, was making his Auto-Tune software to solve musicians' problems, correcting pitch is just about all he intended. In a matter of months, Auto-Tune was in almost every major studio throughout the United States and became a well-kept secret among recording engineers and musicians. It was the ultimate secret sauce, the magic wand an audio engineer could wave that turned a single take into what would've otherwise been the result of a strenuous week of sessions in the vocal booth.", 'This was such a guarded secret that two years later, when Cher\'s slightly Auto-Tuned single "Believe" rose to the top of the charts and everyone clambered to find out what effect had been used, her producers lied, claiming that they\'d achieved the sound with a vocoder.', 'In reality, it was the "retune" dial within the Auto-Tune software that essentially acts as a speed control. Turn it down to slow the speed of your pitch change, up to quicken it, or down to zero for instantaneous pitch changes, which is where the "Believe" magic happens. "With Auto-Tune," says Clayton, "it becomes creative precisely at the moment when producers stop using it the way it was intended."', 'A few years later, T-Pain exploited that single speed control more purposely and persistently than any other artist had up to that point. It became his signature vocal sound and, eventually, was a style that other major artists and rappers started to use with the same regularity. Designed as a tool to help correct the flaws of human pitch, Auto-Tune became an instrument used to manipulate vocals into something not quite human at all—a sound unique to the software that created it. "Auto-Tune became creative,"', 'While we place the dawn of the vocoder in electronic music in the 1970s with pioneers like Bob Moog, Wendy Carlos, and Herbie Hancock, the actual vocoder itself had been invented almost four decades earlier, in 1938. Bell Labs engineer Homer Dudley was responsible, and the original goal was to synthesize human speech to reduce the bandwidth of radio transmissions.', 'While it did successfully serve that purpose, it became particularly useful within a decade of its invention for its encryption security. Vocoding a radio transmission made it much more difficult to intercept, and the vocoder technology was used extensively throughout World War II. In fact, the NSA continues to use vocoder technology in some of its encryption systems even today.', "It wasn't until the late-'50s that the first real attempt was made to use a vocoder in musical applications. In 1959, the Siemens Synthesizer was developed at the Siemens Studio for Electronic Music in Germany to make electronic music for their own films. It functioned similarly to the RCA Synthesizer but also featured a built-in vocoder. Still, it would be several years before the vocoder became popular, or even just widely recognized.", "Bob Moog built his first solid-state musical vocoder in 1968 for the electronic music studio at the University of Buffalo, but his second go of it in 1970 is what put vocoders on the map. In partnership with Wendy Carlos, Moog built a 10-band vocoder device directly inspired by Dudley's original designs. Carlos then used the system on the soundtrack to Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film A Clockwork Orange, introducing it to the world.", "Suzanne Ciani was another early pioneer of the vocoder in electronic music applications. While working toward a master's degree in composition at UC-Berkeley in the late '60s, Ciani met Don Buchla and was immediately taken with the Buchla synth. She began working for Buchla and Associates after graduation, bought her own Buchla 200, and began making her own records and composing professionally.", 'One of her commissions was to make the sounds for the pinball game Xenon in 1979, for which she used her own voice through a vocoder. This was the first female voice to ever be heard in a pinball game, and her work earned her induction into The Pinball Expo Hall of Fame in 2013.', "The following year, in 1980, Ciani also appeared on The David Letterman Show and on PBS's 3-2-1 Contact to demonstrate her synthesizer and the use of a vocoder specifically. Letterman characteristically plays the curmudgeon, but little can detract from watching and listening to Ciani.", "In the following decades, vocoders have become common features of modern synths of all sizes, with Korg's microKorg series being an excellent example of both compact size and affordable price.", "It's common knowledge that guitar amplifiers had been invented and were on the market for roughly two decades before Leo Fender unveiled his narrow-panel tweed amps in the 1950s. However, it's also common knowledge that those '50s Fenders undeniably changed and shaped the amp market forever.", "Immediately upon their release—and even today, if you can find a later-'50s original in good condition—the Fender tweed amps skyrocketed in popularity for their ability to produce beautiful, amplified clean tones, suitable for any genre, the second you plugged in.", 'While these beautiful and crisp cleans were what these tube amps were intended to produce, blues players began to exploit some of the amps\' "flaws" to stunning and ground-breaking degrees. Because these original amplifiers were low-fidelity with inefficient speakers, cranking up the gain would produce that excellent, overdriven distortion that we commonly call "breakup."', 'Famous early examples can be heard on tracks like Chuck Berry\'s 1955 hit "Maybellene," which features an overdriven solo produced by his small valve amplifier. Howlin\' Wolf\'s guitarist, Willie Johnson, and bluesman Pat Hare also began dialing up the gain to emulate this kind of distortion.', 'This fuzzy, overdriven sound could also be achieved if the amp was slightly damaged, which most of the early players figured out accidentally. Perhaps the first and certainly one of the most famous examples can be heard on Ike Turner\'s 1951 single "Rocket 88." One of the speaker cones of guitarist Willie Kizart\'s vacuum tube amplifier had been damaged in transport, and he used it to record the track anyway.', 'Similarly, after playing a live performance with a damaged amp, guitarist Paul Burlison of the Johnny Burnette Trio got such rave reviews for his amp\'s overdriven sound that he subsequently decided to purposely dislodge one of his vacuum tubes for the 1956 recording of "The Train Kept A-Rollin."', 'People loved the unique, "incorrect" sound so much that guitarists started intentionally damaging their equipment to try and achieve the fuzzy tone themselves. Link Wray is another late-\'50s example, known for going beyond simply messing with his vacuum tubes—he actually jammed pencils into his speaker cones for even more dirt.', 'This, of course, was well before the age of effects pedals, and in fact was one of the inciting moments that would lead to their eventual creation (along with another gear malfunction happy accident). But more than that, it redefined what electric guitar players wanted and expected from their amplifiers. The thing that "wasn\'t supposed to happen" turned into one of the key features that defined that amps themselves and eventually helped birth rock \'n\' roll.', 'There are countless other examples of this "innovation by accident"—lots of other notable instances of musicians taking technology and using it outside of its original intention. And really, what is more creative than using what you have to do something brand-new? As Suzanne Ciani aptly explained in her 3-2-1 Contact special, "Part of an instrument is what it can do, and part of it is what you do to it."', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

For most of the decade, the best you could do was buy an early drum machine box like the Ace Tone Rhythm Ace, which seemed like it had been pulled out of a department store organ and permanently set on "foxtrot." Even the more sophisticated drum machines that began to arrive at decade\'s end, like the Roland CompuRhythm, were rudimentary.', 'And if you wanted to actually hit the electronic percussion with a drumstick, options were even more limited. There was the Impakt Percussion Synthesizer, which looked a mix between a blender and a frying pan. There was the Synare Drum Synth, suggestive of a drum stool that had transformed into a flying saucer. And there was the Pollard Syndrum, which provided the distinctive descending bloop on disco records like Anita Ward\'s "Ring My Bell" and snuck into occasional pop smashes like Gerry Rafferty\'s "Baker Street."', "But these were electronic drum pads one would turn to for an extra splash of color here and there, nothing that could fill the role of an actual drum kit. Even when St. Albans-based company Musicaid released its Simmons SD-3 in 1979, the work of wily young British engineer Dave Simmons, it was still worlds away from anything you'd call a drum kit—simply two pairs of rototom-style drum pads connected to an electronic brain.", "That's where Burgess enters the picture. A forward-thinking drummer then finding grassroots success with jazz-rock group Landscape, he had tried all the other electro-percussive instruments available before the SDS-3's arrival. Landscape saxophonist John Walters was playing a Lyrcion Wind Synth at the time, which was distributed by Musicaid, creating the fateful connection that brought Burgess into Simmons' orbit and set the stage for innovation that would have a lasting impact on music technology", '"Recorded drums are really an electronic artifact," Burgess declares. "The instrument being played may have been acoustic but the trend since the early \'60s had been towards close mic\'ing and heavy electronic treatment such as compression, gating, and equalization. The sound that we hear on those records is not much like the sound you hear when you play acoustic drums.... It occurred to me that it would be game-changing to have an instrument that would spit out a [drum] sound with the impact of the recorded sound I heard when I went into the control room for playback."', 'Having played all the earlier electronic drums, Burgess had honed in on what was missing. "None of them really emulated or performed the function of acoustic percussion or drums because they lacked the rise time speed in their voltage-controlled amplifiers, which would impart the instant attack that is characteristic of most percussion instruments. They either had a soft attack or a delayed response, which was disconcerting if you were trying to play them in a live situation."', 'Before joining forces with Simmons, Burgess had contacted Syndrum creator Joe Pollard to offer his thoughts on improving the instrument by adding attack at the start of the signal. "He took exception to any suggestion that the Syndrum was less than perfect," says Burgess drolly, "and it was not a successful call."', 'It was while working live with the SDS-3 and its little sibling the SDS-IV that Burgess had a breakthrough.', '"I triggered them from my live drum set using crystal mics that I bought for 20p from a local electronic shop," he explains. "The system worked really well and for some time [Landscape] toured with the drums being augmented with the triggered electronic sounds of the SDS synths. Effectively, I was using the acoustic drum sound for the attack component and the synthesized sound to augment the tone of the instrument. I figured out that it was possible to combine the sounds from multiple modules of the SDS-3s and -IVs that I had."', 'At the same time, Burgess began thinking about a full-fledged electronic drum kit:', '', '', '', 'Burgess replicated these sounds on different SDS modules and triggered them simultaneously from a simple trigger pad. "I was pretty excited about it," he says of his eureka moment. "The sound coming out of them did what drums are supposed to do–the bass drum sound kicked me in the stomach and moved my rib cage, and the snare was like an axe through my head. Perfect."', 'Burgess excitedly took the long trek from London to share his findings with Simmons. "We both realized we were on to something," he says. "He started working on putting something together that would be a compact, single-purpose percussion device but that would be capable of performing the various functions of the drum set."', 'As a New Zealand native, Burgess had studied electronics and engineering at Christchurch Polytechnic, and had subsequently gotten his hands dirty finding DIY solutions for electronic issues he encountered as a professional musician. His tech background and drumming experience made him the ideal partner for Simmons.', '"Dave put the electronics together," says Burgess, "he was technically very savvy, and it was what he did every day. My technical expertise was useful in knowing what was possible and what was not and in making suggestions."', 'Burgess\' ideas were partly informed by a dissatisfaction at having the drums fight for a place in the live mix against instruments that could go directly through the P.A. "It came about from many conversations on the road with Landscape about why drums were still in the stone age, and all the other instruments were post-Edison technology," he explains.', 'The memory buttons on the front of the SDSV were inspired by Burgess\' performance needs too. "[They were] something I wanted for live shows so you could have the front controls and four presets that I could set up before the show, and that would retain the sounds from show to show," he says. "Being able to change sounds from song to song was a completely new concept for drummers."', 'Even the default sound of the SDSV\'s toms, with the drop-off in pitch you\'ve heard on a million recordings, was based on Burgess\' Pearl concert tom setup. "I tuned the toms with one screw loose and that caused the pitch to drop after the initial attack," he says. "To some extent that happens when you hit a drumhead... Having a loose tension rod accentuates that effect."', 'Simmons and Burgess also put their heads together to create the iconic look of the SDSV\'s drum pads in all their hexagonal glory, though there were some surprising detours along the way. "We had discussed that the pads didn\'t need to be round or even have tensioned drumheads since they were not producing any sound," recalls Burgess. "The next time I went up there he had made a triangular pad with riot shield material as the striking surface."', "In the experimental phase, Simmons tried out everything from batwing-shaped drums to rather creepy head-shaped drums that looked like they'd come off a totem pole.", '"It struck me that the honeycomb would be a great shape because it was ergonomic," says Burgess. "The hex shapes all fit together easily, making it easy to set a kit up in various ways to suit different players. That\'s where the hexagonal shape came from. At that time, we didn\'t know that the whole synthetic drum idea would catch on, and we certainly didn\'t know that it would be the hex shape that would become the dominant shape and the brand image."', 'Ultimately, Simmons created a prototype for the SDSV\'s electronic brain by assembling the necessary components on circuit boards mounted to a piece of wood. By this time, Landscape had evolved into synth-pop pioneers and Burgess had begun a parallel career as a producer. The prototype was inaugurated on Landscape\'s second album, From the Tea-rooms of Mars…, and on his production of the 1980 single "Angel Face / R.E.R.B." by electro-dance troupe Shock, a key record in the early development of the New Romantic movement.', 'The SDSV went into production in 1981, by which point MusicAid had gone belly-up, and Simmons started the company that bore his name. Burgess\' growing renown as a producer and—with the ascent of Landscape\'s "Einstein A Go-Go" to the U.K. Top 5—a pop star, he was offered plenty of opportunities to boost the new instrument\'s profile.', 'Landscape had already demonstrated the prototype in a November 1979 performance for BBC TV\'s futurist-tech showcase Tomorrow\'s World. When "Einstein A Go-Go" hit, the band\'s video for the song featured Burgess (who\'s also the lead singer) playing the creepy-heads version of the kit. And when Landscape appeared on Top of the Pops, the SDSV got another national outing.', "Between his involvement with the aforementioned Shock and rising stars Spandau Ballet and Visage, Burgess was a prime mover in the burgeoning New Romantic scene. He'd already produced Journeys to Glory, the album that put Spandau on the map. For their follow-up, Diamond, Burgess made them the first band to hit the charts with the production model of the SDSV.", '"I had John Keeble play SDSV with the hex pads on Spandau Ballet\'s first single from their second album, \'Chant No. 1,\'" remembers Burgess. "Spandau then used the pads live on TOTP. From all of this the SDSV Hex pads became the house kit on TOTP, and they went viral."', 'In short order, Simmons kits achieved the ubiquity of lightsabers at a Star Wars convention. For the rest of the decade, the SDSV and its subsequent iterations were all over MTV, radio, and concert stages. If you wanted to be hip, you needed a hexagonal drum kit with that Simmons sound. "Having nurtured this idea over several years it was mind-boggling how it took off and how immediate the demand was," confesses Burgess.', "The new generation of synth-friendly pop stars emerging in England at the start of the '80s were a natural fit for the au courant look and sound of Simmons drums. The instrument became a must for every self-respecting denizen of the U.K. Top 40, from Duran Duran and Culture Club to ABC and Ultravox.", "But the Simmons sphere of influence extended far beyond British borders. Not only did the sounds supply the modern touch needed for genre-bending visionaries like Prince, they worked their way into the worlds of forward-looking R&B acts like The Jacksons, Cameo, Zapp, Klymaxx, and loads of others. Simmons kits also entered the hands of jazz-schooled, chops-heavy hands of players like Dave Weckl (Chick Corea Elektric Band) and Chad Wackerman (Frank Zappa). King Crimson's Bill Bruford literally became the Simmons poster boy, demonstrating the instrument on TV and taking it further as a stylist in a concert setting than just about anybody.", 'Bands on the more tech-savvy end of the hard-rock spectrum boarded the Simmons train with gusto. Van Halen\'s "Jump" and "Hot for Teacher" and Rush\'s "Distant Early Warning" are only a few of the notable rock songs of the era that feature Simmons e-drums (alongside acoustic drums and standard cymbals). And of course, after Def Leppard drummer Rick Allen\'s infamous 1984 accident cost him an arm, Simmons raced to the rescue with a custom-designed kit that enabled Allen to drive his band on monster hits like "Pour Some Sugar on Me."', 'By the time renowned session musicians like Jeff Porcaro and John "J.R." Robinson sunk their teeth into the technology, you could scarcely turn a corner without tripping over a Simmons kit. It was turning up on \'80s tracks by everybody from pop/R&B songbirds Stephanie Mills and Patti Austin to jazz-pop MOR icons Manhattan Transfer.', "The rest of the music gear industry paid plenty of attention to the Simmons explosion in the '80s. Drum companies and electronics specialists alike set their teams to work on getting a piece of the action, whether through their own variations on the kits or by snagging the sounds for sampling.", '"Almost immediately the Simmons sound was digitized," recalls Burgess, "and you could buy Simmons sound chips for the new digital drum machines and the basic sounds were being swapped around for the digital samplers and the sampling drum machines."', "In 1983 MPC Electronics came out with their Music Percussion Computer, featuring eight pads in a tabletop format not far removed from Simmons' 1981 Suitcase Kit (which was sort of a portable SDSV). MPC eventually created their own full-on SDSV-style kit, buoyed by the endorsement of drum deity Bernard Purdie himself. Around 1986 even instrument manufacturers in the USSR got their licks in, with Formanta's undeniably Simmons-esque Rokton UDS kit. Yamaha had an '80s four-pad variation on the Suitcase format too, with their DD5. Roland doubled that with their 1985 Octapad, and the same year they strode into Simmons-territory with their Alpha Drum System, its hexagonal pads looking uncannily familiar.", "By the time the '90s rolled around, e-drum kits had fallen out of favor. Players were either looking once again to acoustic sources for their beats or focusing on MIDI triggers and the drum machines developed in parallel to Simmons kits. Simmons' company hung it up at the end of the '90s, having long since shifted its business away from drum kits.", "Some diehards still kept the faith. In 1992, Roland introduced the TD-7, the first kit in its V-Drum line. But it was probably still a lonely time to be an electronic drummer. Something funny happened around the turn of the millennium, though. E-drum kits started seeming cool again. Yamaha unveiled its DTX series in 2000, and Roland—who had never given up on their V-Drums—introduced their TD series a few years later, a line that's still going strong today.", "Along the way, sampling pads like Roland's SPD family went through the roof. Today there are tons of quality, affordable e-drum kits coming from the likes of Donner, Kat, and Alesis, and even hybrid acoustic/electronic kits like the Pearl e/Merge. Even Dave Simmons eventually got back in the business, though his kits have long abandoned the classic SDSV design.", 'Looking back at what his and Simmons\' ideas have wrought, Burgess reckons, "I have to imagine that drum synthesizers would have happened eventually [anyway], but the SDSV definitely established a level of viability and interest as the first drum synthesizer that could perform the function of acoustic drums. I feel sure its presence sped up the process."', 'Assessing subsequent e-drum evolutions, Burgess says, "It\'s impossible to imagine that the SDSV was not the benchmark for the next generation of drum synthesizers that came out. I have to say that the new Roland electronic drums are very good. I have the top-of-the-line set and it does a great deal of what I hoped the SDSV would develop into."', 'Burgess has always been a bit ahead of the curve; forecasting the future, he says, "The final frontier may well be the one I was originally trying to solve—of making the live performance capabilities as or more versatile than the best acoustic instruments. I was trained in jazz and classical music and the test for me has always been whether an electronic set can respond as sensitively and in as many varied ways as a top-of-the-line acoustic set. Sounding like an acoustic set was never important to me. That\'s very easy to achieve today with digital sounds."', 'Sounding like an acoustic set was clearly never on the agenda with the SDSV. If it were, an armada of classic tunes would have sounded very different. When Duran drummer Roger Taylor says the Simmons kit "defined the drum sound for the \'80s," well, he ought to know.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

In the first half, Nelson speaks with Gary Noble about Amy Winehouse's debut, Frank, and in the next, he talks to Salaam Remi about her enduring hit Back to Black.", 'Remi was also kind enough to let us publish a photograph from the sessions.', 'Sometimes the biggest shifts start with the most humble beginnings.', "Three-time Grammy Award–winning engineer Gary Noble met an unassuming 18-year-old Amy Winehouse in 2002 when she arrived at producer Salaam Remi's production studio off of Biscayne and 15th Street in downtown Miami with just her manager. He remembers the precocious singer arriving at the studio with a knapsack on one shoulder and a guitar case on the other. After exchanging introductions, Remi and Noble wanted to hear what she had to offer. The rest is history.", '"I thought she was going to pull out a CD or something. Instead, she got up, opened up the guitar case, took the guitar out, sat down, tuned the guitar in front of us, and then started playing the song on the guitar and singing. His and our eyes made contact and it was like, \'Dude, we have to work with her,\'" Noble says.', "This started a relationship that would result in the making of her debut album, Frank, the world's first full-length introduction to the sorceress of sorrow. Chatting with Reverb, Noble discusses why Pro Tools wasn't good enough during the Frank sessions, Winehouse's curious creative mind, and his last memories of the creative genius.", "For the Frank sessions, Noble remembers Winehouse being recorded on Digital Performer using a Neumann U 47 mic going into an Avalon VT-737sp Tube Channel Strip with very light compression and basically no EQ. For mixing Winehouse's smoky and enveloping vocals, Noble used the Neve 33609/N Stereo Compressor and Avalon AD2055 Equalizer before ending off with a bit of LA-2A, which added a bit of smoothness and warmth to the vocals. Noble now uses Pro Tools HD daily to record artists because of its improved automatic delay compensation, but back in the early 2000s, the DAW that would become industry standard was lacking.", '"At that time, Pro Tools was still TDM [Time Division Multiplexing], and to us, it didn\'t sound as good as Digital Performer. Plus, you had to buy the Pro Tools/TDM rig, which was like 70 grand, just to be able to use Pro Tools. It\'s not like now where you can buy Pro Tools software and run it on anything."', "Winehouse was the driving force for Frank, Noble was the facilitator of her vision, but Noble remembers Remi setting the tone and direction of Frank's production. It's Remi who brought the Yamaha DM-2000 Digital Console to the sessions in order for them to switch between projects at will, a capability impossible on an analog console. It was Remi who wanted everything to sound live. It's also Remi who possibly imbued Frank with the spirit of the great Frank Sinatra.", "Before the Frank sessions, Remi purchased New York City recording studio Soundworks with a U 47 mic in a mic closet leftover from the previous iteration of the studio space, and one possibly used by the great Frank Sinattra. Noble says Remi refurbished the vintage mic to its original factory specs to get it as close as possible to Sinatra's timeless sound.", 'Frank was, in part, destined to be a classic from its inception. "It enhanced her voice more. Some people may not like it because they said it brought up her midrange," Noble says. "But, to me, that\'s what made her special. It brought out the natural resonance of her voice. That\'s what people liked about her."', "Noble remembers a typical session involving Remi making a rough drum track on the MPC whenever Winehouse was beginning to write songs, in order to keep the timing of the song in creation. When she was ready, Winehouse would go in the booth and play guitar and sing simultaneously. That was intentional on Remi's part. He wanted the end result of her recording to sound natural—not pieced together one vocal take at a time. All of the music on Frank came from live instrumentation; nothing was quantized, everything was natural.", '"When we were mixing it, there was no Auto-Tune on her. We wanted it to be her natural essence and she was very conscious of her pitch and was already on point where to enunciate and emote more. She really knew how to work the microphone to the benefit of the song," Noble says. "Even though it was a record, we wanted it to feel live. Salaam was very adamant that it always felt live. It needed to feel like she was performing somewhere when we recorded it and when we mixed the recording. That\'s how we wanted it to feel."', "As far as Winehouse's recording, the Grammy Award–winning singer did no more than three takes for vocals for each song and never punched in. Noble would simply go to the top of the song, press record, and let her perform the song in its entirety. Every time you hear her voice on Frank, it is one stream of consciousness captured in that moment of time, polished later by Remi and Noble. That sort of recording style with an artist as unapologetically open as Winehouse results in lyrics being sung that even industry veterans like Remi and Noble couldn't see coming.", '"I would press the talkback button-like, \'Amy, repeat that. What\'s that line?\' And then we\'d all look at each other and start cracking up. She was very witty and had ways of saying things where if you were paying attention you\'d go, \'Wow! She just said that?\'"', 'Winehouse\'s lasting legacy is those lyrics; words arranged perfectly to tap into the hearts of millions. Her "Stronger Than Me" song from Frank unabashedly delves into her dissatisfaction with her boyfriend leaving her in control of every aspect of their relationship. Noble remembers how touching that session was to work. "It was a good session. It was a little emotional for her because a lot of those songs are about her ex-boyfriend. I like the fact it was triumphant at the same time as she came from feeling low and was able to lift herself out of it. Music for her was like therapy."', 'Noble attests Winehouse was more interested in instruments than recording gear, evidenced by how drawn she was to the Wurlitzer electric piano during the making of Frank. "When she was writing the songs, whether starting from scratch or finishing the songs, she would either use an acoustic guitar or a Wurlitzer. She\'d be playing, figuring out a song, and come in the room like, \'I\'m trying to figure out this part. Which chord you think works better?\' She\'d play the chord progression, and then with the last chord she\'d ask, \'Should I go with that one?\'"', "One particular recording session that exemplifies the curious nature of Winehouse's creativity sticks out in Noble's mind nearly 20 years later. One day, Winehouse was in the studio's lounge after getting done with recording vocals while Remi and Noble were working on a track she had recorded vocals for soon before. They wanted her to relax her voice, which she did. But, soon they started hearing trumpet notes faintly emanating from outside of the studio.", "The sounds were coming from Winehouse trying to learn how to play the trumpet of Bruce Purse, a musician who is credited with playing trumpet on six of Frank's tracks, along with Faith Evans' 1995 debut album, Faith, and other great sessions. Winehouse may have been relaxing her voice from being a conduit for her thoughts, but that didn't mean she quieted her creative mind.", "Winehouse transitioned on July 23, 2011, three months shy of the eighth anniversary of Frank's release, taking her voice and views of the human condition from us mortals on Earth. Before Noble would never see her again, let alone work on another song together, his last memory is the same as his first: a woman with unbridled excitement to share her life with the world, one lyric at a time.", '"A year before she passed away she showed me her notebooks. She had three notebooks filled with lyrics for songs. I was excited because she was writing again. Every time we spoke about the music she got bright-eyed like when we first started working with her."', 'Few people are as intimately connected with the making of the legend that is Amy Winehouse than legendary producer Salaam Remi. After producing timeless records from The Fugees ("Fu-Ge-La"), Nas ("Made You Look" and "I Can") and others, the Grammy Award–winning producer connected with the London-born singer at his Miami production studio in 2003 to help shape her debut to the world. Salaam and Winehouse developed the sort of inseparable bond from those Frank sessions that led to a unique sound and trust. With music as personal as Winehouse\'s, trust with handling it with care is paramount.', '"Being that I produced the majority of the Frank album, and Amy had a certain trust with me, she wasn\'t really getting a lot of work done in London. So when they asked her, "Well, who do you want to go work with?" She said, "I want to go to Miami with Salaam."', 'Back to Black actually began before Frank was finished. Remi remembers early songs, which would later become "Just Friends" and "Addicted," were recorded at the end of the Frank sessions during the fall of 2003. Speaking with Reverb, Remi discusses still having the equipment from the Back to Black sessions in his home, Winehouse choosing his living room as her recording space, and the genius of her creative process.', "The writing and recording of the bulk of Winehouse and Remi's timeless work together on Back to Black were the results of roughly four two-week trips in Miami over the course of 2005 into early 2006. Remi remembers the initial tracks for Back to Black had a jazzier sound than the final product. That was the result of a pure music lover's heart getting acquainted with the sounds of the past.", '"While she was in Miami, we went to a record store, and then she bought a bunch of records. Then she\'s like, \'This is what I\'m listening to now.\' There was The Shangri-Las, Paul Anka, and more doo-wop material like The Moonglows and The \'5\' Royales. She was like, \'This is where I want to go, go with it.\'"', "Remi's downtown Miami production studio was the home of Winehouse's Frank recording in 2003. When they reconvened in 2005 to begin work on songs that would become part of Back to Black, Winehouse found herself in the middle of the living room of Remi's South Miami house. It was there that she found Back to Black's home.", '"With the Back To Black album, she stood in the middle of my living room and said, \'I want to record right here. I like the way my voice sounds standing in the middle of the space.\' It was a brand new house with a two-story ceiling. I just put a kit in the room, I just bought a piano. I put all the amps in the room and then we recorded in that room and that became sonic of many of the songs you can hear."', 'He transformed his living room into a creative playground. He had a Yamaha baby grand piano, Ampeg B-15 amp, and Fender-made Music Man amp with Winehouse\'s melancholic vocals recorded on a Neumann U 47 into an Avalon 737. When you hear [snares] that\'s from a Premier snare Remi calls "used at that time that became his go-to snare until this day." Every one of the songs he produced on Back to Black used that snare, except "Just Friends," which used piccolo snare to achieve the song\'s reggae feel.', 'His living room was also equipped with a Pacific CX Series drum kit, which Remi used to play drums on everything he produced on Back to Black—with the help of Troy Auxilly-Wilson who added drumming on "Tears Dry on The Own" and "Just Friends"—and a C3 Organ with the Leslie speaker cabinet along with bass guitars from Berkeley, California guitar shop Subway Guitars.', "The guitars came from Remi's time recording Carlos Santana in 2000, when he purchased a few custom Hofner-style violin bass guitars from Subway Guitar's owner Fatdog that would later be used on Back to Black. Jim Gaines was the engineer during those Santana sessions and taught Remi a trick that would later help shape Winehouse's magnum opus.", '"Jim Gaines, the engineer, told me that they put an 87 in between the hi-hat and the snare. So that\'s what I would do. I would use the U 87 on a snare. And to this day on all my drums, it does that."', 'As far as recording software, Digidesign Digi 002 rack audio interface in conjunction with a MacBook running Digital Performer. He also used a Neve 1077 Mic Pre/EQ during the Back to Black sessions that could\'ve been yours. "I actually put them on sale on Reverb one time, but I didn\'t say that I recorded Amy Winehouse on them." Remi is able to recall the equipment used nearly 15 years ago because he\'s never moved it from his living room since Winehouse stepped foot into work on Back to Black.', "Remi made sure every song he worked on was fully live instrumentation with no computer programming involved. He wanted to capture Winehouse's engrossing voice in its fully natural state. So, the Neumann U 47 was perfect for just that.", '"What I always loved about the U47 is that I felt like for people that have big voices, it captured from the center of their chest to both of their shoulders to the top of the head. It didn\'t just capture what was right at the mic. When I have the 67, it gets closer than the 87, more right on the point, but I felt like it captured all that room around them, which gave you enough room to hear their vocal ability and more space around it, not just their vocal by itself. So when I was recording her vocals into that, you were able to hear her vocal ability and not just that little piece."', 'As far as Winehouse\'s writing process, Remi remembers she would always write the songs over rough skeleton tracks. She would write for half the week and cut the vocal in one or two takes from top to bottom. The writing on Back to Black feels like diary entries unlocked from Winehouse\'s heart and her writing process mirrored that private freedom. "She\'d be sitting outside a lot of times writing. Sitting in my garden, sitting on the back porch, cooking. She cleaned up my house one day. She would do all types of other stuff."', 'Winehouse trusted Remi to bring her creative vision to life after she recorded her vocals and left the songs with him. "She knew that I was always going to do the right thing as far as arranging sort of vocals. So she didn\'t really go too far with that stuff as far as getting into whatever my decision was. Only she says, \'I don\'t like strings, I don\'t want strings.\'"', 'From there, he would record the live instrumentation of each part of each one of his productions in order to be able to manipulate them as he wanted because outside of the skeletal beat. John Adams played organ and Rhodes on "Unholy War" and "Just Friends," and Vincent Henry played guitar on "Just Friends." It was a collaborative effort even when everyone wasn\'t in the same room.', '"Sometimes my musicians playing the horns weren\'t in Miami. So what I would do is I\'d be working on a track and I would send them like hummed references and different things. And at that time, we would use an iDisk. So he would take it and put it on the Apple iDisk. I put an MP3 up and then call him and say, "This is what I\'m going to do, and this is what the tempo is." And then they would load it into whatever they were working on And they sent it back to me on the Apple iDisk. So that\'s how that was going down."', 'Countless people have had tears ripped from their eyes by Winehouse\'s immersively depressing tunes, but Remi remembers Winehouse wasn\'t emotional while they were recording Back to Black because "our recording space was a safe space and no one was around." One song that did elicit a grim emotional reaction from Winehouse was a slow version of "Unholy War" that never made the album. At the time, Remi thought the track was "the best record I had ever made in my entire life." Unfortunately, for Winehouse, it was too much to bear.', '"When she listened to it, she said it sounds like I\'m dying. And she took it off the album. And I was gutted, I couldn\'t believe that the best record I\'d ever made wasn\'t on Back to Black. I was gutted, it was almost like it was too real."', 'Finer Notes is a new series that looks into the equipment, techniques, and untold stories that went into shaping classic albums, where engineers and producers discuss how they used the equipment of the time to make a body of work that’s timeless.', "About the author: Keith Nelson Jr is a seasoned music journalist who followed his innate passion for knowledge to interview some of the most influential figures in the music industry.

That is, she flips a right-handed guitar and plays it without changing the position of the strings.', 'With her high E on top and low E on bottom, Moye blazes up and down the fretboard like a firebrand, each lick a topsy-turvy version of standard guitar-playing.', 'While she has a sound all her own, Moye is part of a tradition of upside-down guitarists, dating back to folk blues and continuing through the present day.', 'In our video above, she talks through six other upside-down greats.', "Visit Malina Moye's website to learn more about her and keep up to date with her work. Or grab a set of her brand-new Dean Markley Malina Moye Artist Series strings.", 'Elizabeth Cotten, who was born in 1893, played music from an early age, fingerpicking with her left hand on right-handed banjos and guitars. By the age of 12, she had written "Freight Train," one of her most enduring songs. But the wider world wouldn\'t hear it until the roots music revival of the 1950s, when Cotten\'s recording and performing career began in full.', 'As a self-taught blues-folk musician, she approached her upside-down guitar-playing in her own unique way, using her fingers to pluck the bass strings while her thumb picked out the melody.', "When Albert King was still an up-and-coming bluesman in the '50s, he falsely told promoters and audiences that he was B.B. King's brother. While that may have helped land some early gigs, Albert's personal style definitely set him apart.", "Albert was a heavy-handed player, using his thumb to pluck notes with a percussive pop and aggressively bending strings during his solos. At times, he'd bend and drag two notes at once or bend a single note two whole steps above its original position. And remember—by doing this on an upside-down guitar—he was usually bending strings down, in the opposite direction of a standard player.", 'Another king, "The King of the Surf Guitar," was another heavy-handed upside-down guitarist. Dick Dale\'s playing style—as heard on "Misirlou"—combined the Middle Eastern scales of his Lebanese heritage with the reverb-drenched, overdriven sound of cranked Fender amps (which he often blew up at gigs).', "Dale's aggressive tremolo picking later influenced the quick attack of metal guitarists, and his over-the-neck fingering was a move later borrowed by Jimi Hendrix.", 'Unlike many upside-down players, Dale often used a left-handed guitar, so the angled bridge pickup of his Stratocaster gave his bass strings extra high-end bite.', 'Otis Rush introduced "I Can\'t Quit You Baby" to the world. Written by Willie Dixon, Rush first recorded the song in 1956 and made it an instant hit, more than a decade before Led Zeppelin super-charged it on their 1969 debut.', "Rush's intense playing was often done on a Gibson ES-355 or 345—not particularly common choices for upside-down guitarists. And his slow, controlled vibrato is almost unmatched.", 'Rush credited he upside-down nature of his guitar with some of his signature tone, telling Vintage Guitar magazine: "It\'s a lot less stress to tear a house down than to build it up, right? Pulling down makes more sense, to me anyway, and I can work it stronger and get it to sustain better. \'Course, besides all that, I kinda like doing things backwards, anyway."', "Doyle Bramhall II may be one of the most-recognized upside-down guitarists playing today, having performed alongside Eric Clapton and Roger Waters for years. But along with his solo work, he's also played with the likes of Allen Toussaint, Dr. John, Elton John & Leon Russell, and more heavyweights.", 'Like other upside-down players, Bramhall is self-taught. He has said he learned about 100 songs before his first proper lesson, so when the teacher told him he ought to restring his guitar correctly, it was already too late.', "Rounding out our list is another incredible blues guitarist still making music today. Eric Gales' solos can have a cutting bite—bright, clear, and pointed. But he can also be sweet and nuanced.", "Like so many other upside-down players, Gales got started on right-handed guitars because that's simply what was most available. But what's really interesting about Gales is that he kept it up long after he had the choice.", "Gales, whose nickname is Raw Dawg, now has his own signature model: the Magneto Sonnet Raw Dawg.

For those who knew him, it must have seemed a logical next step when he launched Reverend Guitars in the late '90s. Joe had played guitar since he was 19, studied at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo for a degree in industrial design, and taken an intensive course in guitar making at the specialist Roberto-Venn School of Luthiery in Phoenix, Arizona.", 'After that, he returned to Kalamazoo and started making carved-top solidbodies. "I thought I was going to be this guy who sits in his basement and builds extremely expensive guitars, one every six months or so, and charges outrageous amounts of money for them," he recalls. "But as honorable as that sounds, I soon realized that was more work than I bargained on. I thought, There\'s got to be easier ways to make money in this business."', 'Joe turned to repair work, found he enjoyed it, and started to trade in used guitars as well. "Doing repair and buying and selling used instruments is really an education itself, which you really should be doing before you\'re building guitars. I kind of approached it backwards at first. Dealing with all these older guitars forces you to study what came before. And also it forces you to interact with the customers—and they\'ll certainly tell you what they want or don\'t want. It all makes for a good foundation to then design and build your own guitars."', "First came marriage, a move to the Detroit area, and his store, Joe's Guitar Exchange & Repair. That lasted about a year, until Joe started to wonder about manufacturing. He launched J.F. Naylor Engineering speakers, and then around 1994, he converted the store and started Naylor Amplifiers.", '"We were one of the first if not the first to do a Marshall-style boutique hand-wired amplifier, the Naylor Super-Drive Sixty," he says. "The guy who did the amp repair for us when I had the store was Danny Russell, a Marshall amp expert and to this day one of the best amp techs that I know of. So we collaborated, and that\'s how we came up with the Naylor amplifier. But I think the market was more confused than anything," Joe adds with a laugh, "it was like: \'How come this is $1,400?\' We did OK, though, and it resonated with a few high-profile players, like Ron Asheton, George Lynch, Steve Stevens, Kenny Olson, Joey Mazzola and Mike Cross of Sponge, and Jag Tanna of I Mother Earth."', "The amp partnership ended, Joe sold his interest, and in 1997 he started Reverend Guitars, at first operating in the same ex-store and ex-amp-making premises in Eastpointe. The amplifier episode wasn't planned—it just sort of happened. It was guitars that Joe always aimed to build. So he thought that now he really ought to try what he originally wanted to do.", "Joe knew he'd have to compete, to come up with something he could produce relatively easily in a small building. In short, he had to get resourceful. He didn't have the large sums needed to buy a state-of-the-art facility with CNC machines and spray booths and so on. How could he do this?", 'His first idea was to eliminate painting, pretty much the toughest job for any electric guitar maker. So he came up with a body design that did not require painting. It had a moulded rim, onto which a pre-finished laminate top and back was added. This would be trimmed up, routed out, the hardware put on, and that was pretty much it. He wanted a guitar he could make in the US and sell for just under $500. "And aside from that," he says, "it was a very unusual looking guitar."', 'He admits to a fascination with old Danelectro and Silvertone guitars and their small semi-hollow bodies. He had a couple of Dano-made Silvertones and was amazed by their sound. "Both of them sounded incredible, and I figured out it was because they resonated. You could literally feel the body resonating every time you strummed."', 'That Dano resonance was a quality Joe tried to duplicate in his quest for resourcefulness. "I guess in a way I was trying to do something similar, to see what I could do with what was available—inexpensively, but more modern, with nicer hardware and nicer build quality. That\'s what led to the body design of the early Reverends, which I ended up getting a patent on—I called it the High Resonance Body."', 'One of the first Reverend catalogues described the body: "A wood-based phenolic top and back are laminated to a six-inch-wide white mahogany centre block, to which a small steel sustain bar is embedded." Joe laughs when I ask him what exactly wood-based phenolic is. "Sounds a lot nicer than Formica, because that\'s what it was. An early attempt at marketing, I guess."', 'And the center block makes us think of a 335, right? He explains that the block goes the length of the body, with a cutout in the mid treble-side where the pickups and wiring go. "We also do a little cutout into the mahogany at the opposite end of the neck, where we would bolt a small block of steel, which weighed about half a pound. That helped the sustain quite a bit, but it also balanced the guitar. It wasn\'t part of the original plan, but the guitar was so light that it was neck-heavy without the steel block. That definitely increased sustain, and of course it fixed the balance issue."', "Joe recalls maybe a dozen different prototypes to reach the final design. He'd started thinking about this type of construction back at the Roberto-Venn School of Luthiery, so the notion had been rattling around his head for 10 years or so. Leading up to Reverend, he experimented with different materials to check their effect on sound. He recalls trying tops of acrylic or aluminum, center blocks of pine, mahogany, or redwood.", '"I remember one with an aluminum top and back and a center block of foam, like the construction foam you\'d insulate a wall with. But that resonated so much it sounded like a 12-string," Joe says, adding with a smile: "Also, if you leaned too hard on the body you\'d leave a dent."', "With body construction decided, shape was the next consideration. At first, he was all over the board. He began with some single-cutaway ideas but quickly shifted to double-cutaway, mostly for balance, because he wanted a long upper horn to avoid a heavy neck. The Reverend shape he landed on had its influences for sure—some Fender here, a little Rickenbacker there—but Joe's prime intention was to draw enough from the classics to provide familiarity but add enough of his own flair to create something original, which is not as easy as it might sound.", 'He suggests that it\'s a matter of straddling the line between weird and unique. And that is a fine line. "Customers are very finicky about that," he says. "And the first thing they look at is the aesthetics. A guitar is something you wear. It\'s almost like buying a shirt, you know? So if the aesthetic is not spot on, then the sale\'s over, they\'re not gonna buy it."', 'People often ask Joe what the most challenging thing is about designing guitars. "I always tell them the hardest thing, first off, is the body shape. And then the second hardest thing is the headstock shape. And then maybe the pickguard shape after that. There\'s a certain aesthetic balance that, when you see it, you know you\'ve got it. But the hardware, electronics, all that stuff—none of that stuff has changed a whole lot from the \'50s. Obviously, hardware has advanced quite a bit, but the hardest part is making it look like something someone will buy."', "Joe recruited Kent Armstrong's WD Music to supply pickups. The types and combinations defined the major differences between the original Reverend models. This, too, was part of the drive to build something as efficiently as possible, and in this case that meant universal pickguards that simply had different pickup sets in them. The debut models included the Avenger, with a Strat-like layout; the Avenger GT, with two Strat-style single-coils and a bridge humbucker; the Commando, with a slanted lipstick at the neck plus bridge humbucker; the Rocco, with two humbuckers; and the Slingshot, with two P-90-like pickups; plus a couple of basses.", 'Reverend guitars—the brand name came when Joe saw a feature on Reverend Gary Davis in a blues magazine—were first seen in public at a NAMM trade show in July 1997. Joe recalls this as a pivotal event in the firm\'s early history. "My wife, Kristen, and I rented a 20-foot moving van, packed it full of guitars, drove it to Nashville, and set up our booth. We filled it entirely with turquoise guitars. That was the only color we brought. We thought it was the coolest color and that no one could ignore a booth full of turquoise. And it worked! We landed about a dozen dealers, some pretty big ones—and I thought OK, maybe I\'m not so crazy after all. Maybe this can work. I\'m sure Kristen was quite relieved as well."', 'There was a natty Two-Tone Teardrop case in line with some of the deco leanings of Joe\'s design vibe. At first, all Reverends had a banjo-style armrest, a Gretsch-like chromed guard that sat on the top body edge where your arm might reside. Joe says people either loved that feature or really, really hated it, with not a whole lot of undecideds. His own view is that you can never have too much chrome on a guitar. "That\'s how we think in Detroit! The Cadillac line of thought. More chrome? Why not."', 'Finishes for the phenolic tops soon blossomed into a vibrant array of possibilities. By the year 2000, options included Fireball Red,Powder Yellow, \'69 Lime Green,Deep Purple, as well as some glittery metal finishes, from Engine Turned Aluminum to Bug Eye Black Chrome and Lava Swirl to Diamond Plate. These were achieved with aluminum bonded to phenolic laminate described by the catalogue as "a three-dimensional finish and a unique tone with increased attack, sustain, chime, and harmonics."', 'The metal finishes did quite well, Joe says. "The Bug Eye Black Chrome was definitely the most popular, and probably one of the most popular finishes that we did during that era. At one point, in fact, we decided to do all metal finishes and discontinued the regular colors—though I\'m not sure it was the smartest move as we got a little pushback on that. But nobody had really done anything quite like those finishes."', "Those standout finishes helped the visibility of Reverend in the early years of the company, but also some notable players began picking up on the guitars. Joe mentions a few of the early adopters: Ron Asheton of The Stooges; Carl Verheyen, the LA studio ace; Henning Rümenapp of Guano Apes; Jeff Ross, with Candye Kane; Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins; and Rick Vito, then in Bonnie Raitt's band.", 'Billy Corgan tells me he met Joe at a trade show in 1999. "We just hit it off," he says. "I think I bought five guitars and basses that day, and I used them almost immediately on what became the Smashing Pumpkins album Machina." The Reverends Billy acquired were a mix of Slingshot guitars and Rumblefish four and five-string basses.', '"What attracted me to Reverend was the build quality of the guitars," he remembers, "and the unique use of materials at that time. Sort of a new take on old instruments that felt fresh." And how did they fit in with his other guitars at the time? "The Reverend tones seemed smoother and had more depth than my normal \'70s Strats," he concludes. "Let\'s call it a different kind of clarity."', 'Rick Vito had a fine guitar design of his own, the deco-drenched Streamliner. He\'d had the custom one-off built in the late \'80s by Toru Nittono, a Japanese luthier who worked then as a repairman at Norman\'s Rare Guitars in Reseda, California. Rick\'s inspiration for the distinctive look of the Streamliner came from the deco lap-steels of National and Supro. "I love the deco era," he tells me. "I love how it morphs into mid-century modern, \'50s style, how it even in a way entered into the early part of the \'60s. It\'s my favorite period of design." Rick debuted his Streamliner when he joined Fleetwood Mac in 1987.', '"That guitar was a pleasure right off the bat, it just worked, and I\'ve used it on tons of recordings and tons of tours," he says. By the time he came upon Reverend Guitars in the late \'90s, his main slide guitar was a \'56 Les Paul TV—the instrument he\'d used in the studio for Bob Seger\'s "Like A Rock"—plus a James Tyler Tele with two custom-wired humbuckers. He also had an original Burst, Broadcaster, and Nocaster. "I\'ve always been a vintage guitar collector and user, always loved traditional as well as trying to go into my own realm a little bit."', 'Those collectables became too valuable to trust to the vagaries of touring, and his fears in that direction helped steer him toward Reverend. "They were making quality guitars that I wouldn\'t feel uncomfortable about bringing on the road," he explains. A friend showed him a cool black Reverend with lipstick pickups, and toward the end of \'98, as he was about to go out with Bonnie Raitt in Europe opening for Eric Clapton, he called Joe.', 'After trying a lipstick-equipped Reverend Spy on that tour, Rick switched to a Slingshot, with P-90s. "I loved it," he recalls. "It was everything I\'d said I was hoping for. Played like a dream, sounded great. The Kent Armstrong P-90s they used had a little bit of a brighter sound than your average dark P-90—sort of a cross between a P-90 and a little brighter Fender-ish sound. You could really control it by rolling off the tone a bit to get more into Gibson, and if you had it full up it was slightly more Fender-ish."', 'Further Reverends followed for Rick, among them a Slingshot with a pink front and black back, to chime with his Pink & Black solo album, and a Rocco with a palm motif on an aluminum front. "They had a Fender-style C-shape neck at that point, very comfortable to play. They used really nice medium-jumbo frets, which made it even more easy to play, and I loved the lightweight quality of the original guitars, which were chambered on the inside. I used to hear people say you need the density of the wood and all that. Well, you don\'t need that to have a great sounding guitar, and the Reverends proved it to me."', 'Joe points out that a lot of the players that Reverend started working with in this early period are still on board today. Rick and Billy are good examples—the current line includes the Billy Corgan Signature and Billy Corgan Terz models as well as the Rick Vito Signature Soulshaker.', 'Back in the early days, as the word spread, the practicalities of running a guitar-making business became more evident to Joe on a day-to-day basis. "When you build a guitar from the bottom up, there\'s so many suppliers you\'ve got to deal with," he says by way of example. "Building one guitar I think involved maybe 36 suppliers, or something like that, when you count everything—hardware, screws, plastics, wood, and all the rest."', 'It was a running challenge to keep all that organized, to keep the supplies flowing, to ensure they did not run out of essentials. On top of that, somebody had to sell the guitars. At first, besides running the company, Joe was the guy selling everything. And then on top of that, he found himself going to a guitar show every six to eight weeks or so, and that usually involved driving across the country. "So," he pauses and laughs, "well—it was very grassroots in the first few years."', 'Slowly and satisfyingly, Reverend guitars began to enjoy growing success in those formative years at the end of the \'90s and into the 2000s. "We just wouldn\'t go away, for starters," Joe says, laughing some more.', '"The guitars were very unusual, and even if you didn\'t like them, you never forgot them. You always remember Reverend—because you love it, or you think it\'s ridiculous. We were able to put our name on the map pretty early on, because they were so unique. We were doing advertising and promotion, and we ran the infamous Kid Rock ad in \'98, where he\'s flipping the bird. And that really put our name on the map. They say there\'s no bad publicity, and we went with that. Everybody knew who we were, right away!"', 'By 2005, Reverend was ready for a sweeping change. The brand began to offer an imported line, at first called the Stage King series, and the following year Reverend officially discontinued all USA guitar production. Building at home had become more and more expensive.', '"By the time we discontinued the US guitars, they had almost tripled in price from the original \'97 price," Joe says. "That was simply down to just labour and supplies. It became impossible to build them here and still keep it a high-value at least mid-priced guitar. We were no longer able to hit that target. Sales were already starting to decline, and of course by then all the competition had already started importing. So we were already a little bit behind the curve. It was just an inevitable situation."', "Joe had taken a solo visit to NAMM where he went around asking people who they were working with, and then visited all the import Asian manufacturers' booths, inspecting everything in detail. Everybody he talked to kept pointing him to Mirr Music of South Korea. They had a good reputation and, crucially, were capable of doing custom work.", 'When Joe talked to Hank Cho, who runs Mirr, Hank said he could build anything Joe wanted. "He told me if I sent him a drawing, he could do it, no problem. So he was very open to custom designs, and he could do them in reasonably small quantities, too. Some of these guys won\'t talk to you unless you\'re doing a few thousand guitars a month or something like that, and we were nowhere close to that when we started out with the import thing. He could do custom and he could do low quantities. It was kind of a no-brainer."', "But this all marks the start of another story for another day. We'll leave Reverend for now at the turning point of their first era, in 2006, and on the cusp of the success that continues today amid a much-expanded line (and a record sales year in 2020). In 2010, Ken Haas became CEO and Penny Haas became COO, but Joe is still very much the brand's chief designer, and the firm is headquartered in Toledo, Ohio, following a move in 2015.", 'Back in the late \'90s, when Joe saw the first Reverends completed and ready for shipping, I wonder if he ever thought he\'d be here now, still busy designing, developing, and supporting Reverend guitars. "I did," he replies, with a refreshing absence of false modesty. "I felt like we had longevity, and when Ken became CEO and I was allowed to just design guitars, that put me in a very comfortable situation where I could do what I feel I do best. And not have to worry about running the company. That\'s when I felt that this could go for a long time."', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

Icy synthesizers. Robotic vocals. These are the hallmarks of classic electro, a genre of music that ruled the clubs, rollerskating rinks, and backyard breakdance battles in the 1980s. Although it only lasted a short period of time—roughly from 1982 until 1986—its influence can still be felt (and heard) today in modern dance music, pop, and hip-hop.', 'While this piece won\'t get too deep into the history of electro (for that, we recommend our thorough "A Not-So-Brief History Of Electro"), we will shine a light on the gear used in 10 seminal tracks, as well as some of the recording tricks the artists used to get their signature sounds.', "While it's not much of a spoiler alert to say that the Roland TR-808 drum machine played a big part, as did vocoders, like the similarly vocoder-abusing robot Transformers, there's more to electro than meets the eye.", 'Any conversation about electro naturally starts with Afrika Bambaataa and "Planet Rock." Released in 1982 on New York hip-hop label Tommy Boy, "Planet Rock" was an instant sensation and introduced the world to a new kind of dance music. It was recognizably hip-hop—there was rapping after all—but the usual disco drums and backing band were replaced with a drum machine and synthesizers. This is how they did it.', 'Of course, that drum machine was the Roland TR-808. It had already been on the market for two years when Bambaataa and producer Arthur Baker cut "Planet Rock," which likely caused a boost in sales, at least in big cities with access to dance clubs. The punchline? According to legend, they didn\'t even own one and hired a guy they found in a classified ad to bring one in and program it.', '"Planet Rock" is pretty minimal—another defining element of electro—with little but glassy synth strings to provide musical accompaniment. These came courtesy of future New Order producer John Robie and his Sequential Circuits Prophet-5. The polyphonic Prophet-5 would go on to appear on a ton of classic electro tracks (see below). It was played live by Robie, purposely aping Kraftwerk\'s "Trans Europe Express," one of Bambaataa\'s favorite records at the time. (The beat was also influenced by Kraftwerk, specifically "Numbers.")', 'Additional instrumentation included bass from a Moog Micromoog (played, as with the Prophet-5, live by Robie) and the soon-to-be ubiquitous orchestra hit banged out on a Fairlight that they found in the studio. While often misidentified as a vocoder, the vocal effect in "Planet Rock" is actually Bambaataa rapping through a Lexicon PCM 41.', 'Heavy 808, cold synths, snappy bass, minimal arrangement, and robotic vocals—the basic building blocks of "Planet Rock" would be used again and again in the next few years, and beyond. The "Planet Rock" sessions also yielded the backing tracks for Planet Patrol\'s "Play at Your Own Risk," a vocal-lead R&B number that kicked off the R&B/electro crossover movement.', 'While many of electro\'s major players were in New York, the genre was by no means restricted to the Big Apple. Gregory Broussard, better known as the Egyptian Lover, was at the forefront of Los Angeles electro, a scene that also included a pre-N.W.A. Dr. Dre and his World Class Wreckin\' Cru and the L.A. Dream Team. "Egypt, Egypt," with its Middle Eastern-style melodies and vocoder boasts, is his crowning achievement.', 'At the center of the track is a devastating beat laid down on the Roland TR-808. What really sets the Egyptian Lover\'s 808 apart from others is his use of the trigger pulse as a percussion element. The engineer for the "Egypt, Egypt" sessions accidentally hooked up the trigger out to the mixing board but it sounded so good they left it in.', 'The synthesizer on the track is none other than the Roland Jupiter-8. As with "Planet Rock," it provides melodic support but largely stays out of the way to let the drum machine do its thing. The Egyptian Lover was a DJ for the party collective Uncle Jamm\'s Army and he arranged "Egypt, Egypt" as a dance song, with placement of turnarounds and other song elements reflecting how he would cut in records to keep the dancefloor hyped.', 'The last piece of the "Egypt, Egypt" puzzle is the vocoder. While there were a number of units around in 1984, the vocoder of choice for most electro artists was the rackmount Roland SVC-350. It was the same for the Egyptian Lover and it\'s what gives this track such flavor.', 'The Egyptian Lover is still going, DJing, touring, and releasing records using largely the same gear. His latest record, 1986, is out now.', 'Most of the electro cuts on this list are fairly minimal, with just a drum machine and a single synth to provide a skeletal melodic motif. Not "Electric Kingdom." Released by Twilight 22 in 1983, the track is a real tour de force, packed full of synthesizers expertly played.', 'The men behind the music were Gordon Bahary, a keyboard whiz who had previously worked with Stevie Wonder and Herbie Hancock, and Joseph Saulter, who provided vocals along with Bahary. We got in touch with Bahary to get the story behind the song.', "No surprises that the drum machine the duo used was the TR-808. However, Bahary augmented the rhythms from Roland's machine with some sounds that he made with an ARP Odyssey synthesizer.", '"I had created a drum machine long before they were actually manufactured," he explains. "This was in 1977 for Stevie Wonder. We were at IAM Studios in Irvine, California recording his followup to Songs in the Key of Life. I created a kick and snare on the ARP." The Odyssey was also used to provide the bassline (played live!) as well as the lower sound that underpins the 808 kicks.', 'The Odyssey also allowed Bahary to create ring modulation sounds for use as accents. "The ring modulation was done with the ARP. I had created a touch-sensitive keyboard before they were manufactured. So the harder I pressed, the louder the sound, or the filter would open, or both, giving it expression," he says. "Years later it became standard."', 'When asked if he used a polysynth on the record, Bahary says, "Yes, the (Sequential Circuits) Prophet-5 for harmony on the lead melody. Very fat sound and great filters." All of those unique melodies were inspired by his childhood. "My parents are from the Middle East, and these types of melodies were always playing in the house as a kid. I wanted to take the most opposite musical ideas and combine them."', '"Electric Kingdom" is full of choral sounds and orchestral percussion as well, like timpani. These were played with an E-Mu Emulator. "The E-Mu sampler was used for voices," Bahary says. "It had a floppy disk. I recall the anticipation for a small file to be loaded." The harpsichord, however, was not sampled, but real. "I saw it at Kingdom Sound Studios (coincidentally named) and [asked] the engineer, \'Can we do a take with this?\'"', 'Lastly, the vocoder was a Korg VC-10.', 'Bahary is still active in music and has just built Electric Kingdom Studios in New York, complete with the new Rupert Neve 5088 automated console and 24-track tape. His new solo album will be released later this year through The Orchard/Sony.', 'The influence of Kraftwerk is strong in classic electro. "Planet Rock" combined "Numbers" and "Trans Europe Express" into one potent whole. The Egyptian Lover has described his music as Kraftwerk meets Prince. The influence of the four Germans is also apparent in the "Home Computer"-like climbing chromatic sequence that forms the repeating motif for "Clear," the 1983 dance floor bomb by Detroit\'s Cybotron.', 'Comprising future techno architect Juan Atkins and Vietnam veteran Rik Davis, Cybotron took their electronic experiments to the next level after hearing "Planet Rock" on a trip to New York and buying an 808. This formed the backbone for "Clear," as it did for so many other classic electro tunes.', 'There is less clear information on the making of "Clear" than some other tracks but there are clues and decades-later recollections.', '"Clear," like other electro jams, has the requisite icy synth strings. Polysynths, however, were extremely expensive in 1982 when they recorded the song. It\'s unsurprising then that they turned to a Roland RS-09 string machine for poly duties.', 'Other gear in Davis\' arsenal at the time included an ARP Odyssey and Axxe as well as a Sequential Circuits Pro One, a favorite for bass and popular with electro producers at the time. Atkins\' first synth was the Korg MS-10, which, as he explained in an interview with MusicRadar, he used for "weird, UFO-type sounds and effects."', 'Atkins told Reverb earlier this year that the Pro One\'s sequencer was an integral part of "Clear": "I had a TR-808, a Pro One, and a Korg MS-10. And what you could do with the Pro One is that it had a sequencer on it and you could trigger the sequence from the trigger out from the 808."', 'Cybotron would soon break up but Atkins would continue evolving electro (and later techno) as Model 500. While electro soon died out in its birth place of New York, it continued to be popular in Detroit, with groups like Drexciya and Aux 88 furthering the sound.', 'A funky bassline. High-pitched cartoon voices. A story about a sound clash between aliens and Superman. In 1984, there was no cut more popular with breakdancing kids than Newcleus\' "Jam On It." We spoke with Ben Cenac, aka Cozmo D, about how the song came together.', 'Like most other electro tracks, Cenac managed to get a lot of mileage out of a few pieces of gear. "I was forced to make the most of a very limited situation back then," he explains. Again, the drum machine of choice was the TR-808. There was nothing else that could even come close in terms of analog impact.', "As for that incredible bassline, it was provided by the Sequential Circuits Pro One. Essentially one voice of the Prophet-5, it was a go-to bass synth for lots of electronic acts in the early '80s. And not just electro either—it was even a favorite of Skinny Puppy.", 'The sequenced line in the track came from another famous Roland box, the TB-303. The 303 didn\'t really get popular until the Chicago guys started to abuse it a few years later, but its use in electro wasn\'t without precedence either. Check out Shannon\'s "Let The Music Play" for another example.', "Remember Cybotron's Roland RS-09? Newcleus used one too. Although by this time string machines had a reputation for being cheesy, you get the most from what you can.", 'We asked Cenac how he was able to sync everything together, this being before MIDI. "The 808 and the 303 were programed individually in song mode and synced together via a Roland Sync cable," he explains. "The bassline was programed using one of the Pro One\'s two 16-step sequences and triggered via the 808\'s accent out."', 'Lastly, we just had to ask how they made the famous wikki wikki voices. "We slowed down the master tapes to record the vocals." Sometimes it\'s just that simple.', '"It\'s time!" With that famous vocoder intro, 17-year-old Jerry Calliste Jr., better known as Hashim, announced his presence to the world. His debut record, "Al-Naayfish (The Soul)"—with its insistent broken beat, eerie synth strings, and turntable scratching—has become one of the most recognizable entries in the electro canon.', 'The inaugural release on Cutting Records, "Al-Naayfish (The Soul)" was made—like most classic electro—with very few pieces of gear. Like Cozmo D and Newcleus, Hashim made the most with what he had, building up the song at New York\'s Secret Sound Studio with a single drum machine and synthesizer.', "The main focus of the song is, of course, Roland's TR-808 drum machine. With so much 808-based hip-hop happening in New York in the early '80s, local music shops must have been doing a brisk business.", 'The rest of the record was accomplished with one synth. No, not the Prophet-5, although that would be a very good guess. Hashim instead used a Korg Poly-61 to provide bass, strings, and the arpeggio, the latter likely synced to the 808 to match the tempo.', 'Hashim would follow up "Al-Naayfish (the Soul)" with another devastating electro record, "We\'re Rocking the Planet," which would add an Oberheim DMX to the percussion mix. The DMX, which used samples rather than analog synthesis, was the other big hip-hop drum machine, popular with artists of the time like Run-D.M.C. and (unsurprisingly) Davy DMX.', '"Planet Rock" may have been the record that turned New York onto electro, but "Rockit" turned on the world. Produced by Bill Laswell of Material and something of a last-chance gamble for Herbie Hancock, "Rockit" combined electro rhythms, scratching, and of course Herbie\'s incendiary playing into a cultural touchstone.', "Let's start with the rhythm section. Laswell and his team put together a backing track, using an Oberheim DMX supplemented with a Synare likely triggered by the DMX. Laswell was a bass player by trade, and although the bassline in the track feels like it was fingered, it's too synthetic for a guitar. The Moog Minimoog listed in the album credits is the more likely candidate.", 'Once the backing track was done, Laswell went into the studio with Herbie, who wrote the famous lead melody. This was played on a Rhodes Chroma and overdubbed a number of times to create a wide feel.', 'Herbie also wanted to add some scat vocals and used his Sennheiser VSM-201 vocoder to achieve this. The VSM-201 is the same vocoder that Kraftwerk used on their records and—while too rare and expensive for most electro producers—was not out of the reach of Hancock.', 'The final key element to "Rockit" was Grandmixer D.ST\'s scratching, with the DJ wearing down the grooves in a copy of Fab Five Freddy\'s "Change The Beat." "Rockit" also contains a Led Zeppelin guitar stab from the album Coda, triggered from a Lexicon Prime Time delay unit.', 'Herbie\'s gamble with "Rockit" paid off big time and it helped bring the jazz veteran back into the limelight, shining some light on hip-hop and electro at the same time.', 'Electro is generally associated with New York but it had a massive presence in Miami as well. Known down south as freestyle and later as bass music, Miami\'s love for electro was largely down to the efforts of one man, Pretty Tony. The brains behind Freestyle ("Don\'t Stop The Rock"), Debbie Deb ("When I Hear Music"), Trinere ("They\'re Playing Our Song"), Tony also served up records under his own name.', '"Fix It In The Mix" was the first Pretty Tony record. Released in 1984, it was made—like many other electro songs—with the bare minimum of equipment. Like Hashim and "Al-Naayfish (The Soul)," Tony managed to get all of that music from just a single drum machine and synthesizer (and of course a vocoder).', "The drum machine? Why, of course it's the Roland TR-808. No matter whether New York, Los Angeles, Detroit, or Miami, the drum machine of choice for classic electro was the 808. The 808 would go on to play an even bigger role in Miami bass music, with samples of the boom extending its power and bass response.", 'As for Tony\'s synthesizer, like Hashim he opted for something different than the Prophet-5. "Fix It In The Mix" was made entirely with a Roland Juno-60, an instrument not usually associated with hip-hop. After a few hit records, Tony would actually go on to buy a Prophet-5 though.', 'One of the defining moments of "Fix It In The Mix," particularly in the B-side dub, is the sound of breaking glass. While he later used an Emulator, on this track he had to do it the old-fashioned way: by recording it with a microphone. "The breaking glass, I took a cardboard box and I put a dumbbell in it," he explained in an interview with Red Bull Music Academy. "I hung the mic over down in it and threw a champagne glass, hit record, and broke it. That drove people crazy."', "Unlike the Egyptian Lover, Pretty Tony never used his own voice on his records, only vocoders. While it's hard to find confirmation, it's a good bet to assume that he used the Roland SVC-350, the rackmount version of the VP-330. This same unit was favored by Dynamix II, who would keep the flame of Miami electro lit into the '90s and beyond.", 'Whodini—comprising Jalil Hutchins, John Fletcher (aka Ecstasy), and DJ Grandmaster Dee—were one of the first hip-hop groups to have sizable hits. Their debut single, "Magic\'s Wand," a primer on the history of rap and radio host Mr. Magic, wasn\'t one of them. However, it wasn\'t for a lack of trying. With production from a young Thomas Dolby, it\'s got one of the most infectious rhythms in hip-hop. Let\'s see if we can tease out how it was made.', '"Magic\'s Wand" came out in 1982, around the same time as Dolby\'s debut album, The Golden Age of Wireless. It\'s safe to assume that the gear employed on "Magic\'s Wand" would be similar to that of his own release. For both, he avoided the use of any typical drum machines. No TR-808 or DMX here. Dolby instead used a Simmons electronic drum set triggered by Tangerine Dream\'s old PPG 360 Wave Computer. Esoteric but what do you expect from Thomas Dolby? He also had a Fairlight, which could have been used to add percussive noises.', 'How about the bass? There\'s clearly a fretless bass involved but the synth bass could have been a Moog Source, as played on "She Blinded Me With Science," or a Micromoog, which he used when playing live around the time.', 'While "Magic\'s Wand" is not your typical electro track, it does have some deliciously funky synthesizer playing, including some chords that could only come from a polysynth. Dolby was known to use a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5. We\'d put our money on it.', "Lastly, let's address the vocoder that delivers the hook. In a sequence recorded for TV show Riverside, Dolby demonstrates some of the gear he used around this time. There is a Roland VP-330 clearly in the background. It fits the bill.", '"Magic\'s Wand" would appear on their debut self-titled album in 1983, alongside tracks recorded with Kraftwerk-producer Conny Plank. Not your typical hip-hop backing tracks, to say the least.', 'We started in New York in 1982 and that\'s where we\'re going to end. Man Parrish\'s "Hip Hop, Be Bop (Don\'t Stop)" was released around the same time as "Planet Rock" and coincidentally also featured synth playing by John Robie. Despite using similar equipment, the two tracks could not be more different. Where "Planet Rock" is tight, "Hip Hop" is loose and more experimental, almost psychedelic at times. Let\'s check out the gear Man Parrish used to create his influential record.', '"That (record) except for a few overdubs was basically done in my bedroom on an eight track/channel Tascam tape recorder and mixer," Man Parrish told Magazine Sixty. "\'Hip Hop Be Bop\' was just basically me playing around with some sounds and grooves that then got developed into the track you hear now."', 'As with most other seminal electro cuts—and despite being one of the first electro records released—"Hip Hop Be Bop" employed a TR-808 to provide the beats. The drum machine\'s famous cowbells are particularly well represented.', "Man Parrish has stated that he used two synthesizers on this track, both from Sequential Circuits: a Prophet-5 and Pro One. While he doesn't specify which synth played the bass, it's safe to assume it was the Pro One, given that it's a sequenced line, and Man states that he made use of the onboard eight-note sequencer.", '"You have to remember, this was all way before MIDI, and before computers," he explained in the same interview. "We had to do all kinds of tricks to synchronize the different tracks on tape to play at the same time… Everything from punching in and out of the track, overdubs, and using the 808 drum machine to send trigger pulses, via the rimshot pattern, to advance the analog sequencer to the next step. We basically wrote the sequencer rhythm part on the drum machine, and the sound of the rimshot pulsing would drive the analog sequencer."', 'Man Parrish would follow-up "Hip Hop, Be Bop (Don\'t Stop)" with the more conventional "Boogie Down Bronx" and would have a Top 20 hit in the UK in 1987 with "Male Stripper."', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

It doesn't take a genius to determine your likely answer. You may be surprised, however, to hear that some people disagree. To demonstrate, we're going to consider as a case study a certain Fender Stratocaster owned at one time, apparently rather briefly, by a certain James Marshall Hendrix.", "It's June 1967, and love is all around. Jimi Hendrix is dressed in his brilliantly colored stage clothes and is busy tuning guitars in a dressing room backstage at the Saville Theatre in London. In the distance, he can hear Procol Harum playing in the main hall. He moves methodically between his main Strats and a Flying V, but also he prepares a special Strat that he plans to sacrifice at the end of his set in the evening performance.", "Jimi arrived in London from New York in September the previous year, 1966. With his manager Chas Chandler, he soon recruited Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell to form the Experience, where he played Stratocasters right from the start. In our case study here, however, we'll focus on an example with a Candy Apple Red body that became the sacrificial Saville guitar.", "Jimi and his roadie were in the habit of exploiting Fender's bolt-together construction and would swap bodies, necks, pickguards, and more to make amends for the damage Jimi inflicted during his wilder on-stage antics.", "Regardless of where the bits and pieces of this particular guitar originated and how long they'd been mated, we do know how much guitars cost back in the mid-'60s. A brand new custom color Stratocaster similar to Jimi's red one had a UK list price then of £180/12/0. That's 180 pounds (£), 12 shillings (after the first /), and zero pence (after the second slash), which decimalized Brits would write later as £180.60.", 'In London in early \'67, Jimi would have shelled out between about £60 and £100 for a secondhand Strat. In February, for example, the Pan shop above London\'s Flamingo Club advertised a "Fender Stratocaster, good, red" for £65. Let\'s assume this was about the price the Saville guitar cost The Jimi Hendrix Experience. It didn\'t stay "good" for long, though, because Jimi managed to whack a large split in the body during a lively Scandinavian gig in May.', 'The damaged Fender seemed beyond repair, but Jimi decided to make good use of it. The Saville show was the last British gig before the band went off to the United States until August—including the Monterey Pop Festival where he would destroy another decorated Strat—so he wanted this gig and this guitar to mark a sort of farewell.', 'Jimi painted the front of the battered red Strat with black and white swirly foliage and hearts. The back he painted over in white, handily covering the split, and he added a couple of flowers and a message in black marker pen: "May this be love or just confusion, born out of frustration-wracked feelings of not being able to make true physical love to the universal gypsie queen of true, free expressed music. My darling guitar, please rest in peace. Amen." Jimi wrote the date and location of the gig alongside.', 'At the Saville, Jimi\'s trio went on to play their final set. Knowing that Paul McCartney and George Harrison were in the audience, they opened with a cover of "Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band," released a matter of days prior. After a delay caused by problems with mics and amps, they soldiered on and finished triumphantly with "Are You Experienced." During that finale, a roadie had the prepared Strat ready.', '"A packed Saville Theatre audience erupted on Sunday night as Jimi Hendrix announced that this would be his last gig in Britain "\'for a long, long time,\'" Hugh Nolan reported in Disc and Music Echo, "and then [Hendrix] proceeded to smash a beautifully-painted guitar and hurl the pieces into the clamoring crowd—a guitar he\'d painted in glorious swirling colors and written a poem on the back dedicated to Britain and its audiences. Bathed in a flickering strobe light, he crashed the guitar about the stage and hurled what was left of it to eager souvenir-hunters in the audience."', 'Those souvenir hunters evidently saved their treasure for nearly 25 years. Let\'s jump forward to Sotheby\'s auction house in August 1991. Lot 420, to be precise: "Two Pieces of a Guitar Smashed by Jimi Hendrix, 1967." Perhaps the owners perked up the previous year, 1990, when a Strat—sold as the guitar Jimi used at Woodstock—went for a record £198,000 (about $325,000 at the time).', 'Maybe that persuaded them the time was right to have a rummage in the attic. They were right to do so. The auction estimate for an "incomplete body of a Fender Stratocaster," along with an accompanying Saville concert programme, was £4,500–£6,500. The two halves, split right along Jimi\'s original Scandinavian crack and with most of his poem intact on the backs, sold for a hefty £29,700.', "There are a few ways to work out what a historical amount of cash might be worth in today's money. None of them are precise, which is hardly surprising, because the calculations involve things like average earnings—but how average is average?—and treacherous mathematical stuff like price indexes and inflation fluctuations.", "With those caveats in mind, such calculations can give us a rough idea about the then-and-now of the sums we've been juggling.", "* The Saville Strat would have cost the equivalent in today's money of about £3,800/$5,300 when it was a new guitar in the '60s (remember that original £180.60?).", "* You'd need to have about £1,200/$1,700 today to match the 65 quid or so Jimi paid when he picked up the Strat secondhand around the early months of '67.", "* The £29,700 realized at auction in 1991 for the dismembered body parts would be about £68,000/$96,000 in today's money. As for what it might make if current owner, the MoPOP Museum of Pop Culture, in Seattle ever decided to sell—well, shall we guess at comfortably six and possibly seven figures?", "* And suppose Jimi never smashed that guitar. Let's presume its true identity was lost over the years as it was sold and traded around. Such a relatively anonymous mid-'60s Strat in Candy Apple Red could be yours, for sure, just so long as you can afford today's ticket price for this kind of collectable. Let's say around £15,000/$22,000 or so—depending on the exact year, originality, and condition, of course.", "Fed up with figures? Right, put down that favorite guitar of yours for a moment, and let me once more ask you the question we started with. Now that you know all this, do you still think your instrument is worth more completely intact, or could it soar in value once it's shattered in pieces?", 'Reviewing Jimi\'s Saville gig in 1967, the unimpressed music critic Chris Welch wrote in Melody Maker: "Running half an hour overtime, the group concluded with a freak-out of guitar smashing by strobe light. Bits of the guitar were then thrown into the audience for collectors, while Mitch\'s drum stand was left in a state of collapse. Own up lads, who needs all that?" What a pity Mitch Mitchell didn\'t put his collapsed kit out of its misery and smash it to smithereens.

He wondered if Seymour could analyze his Burst’s twin PAFs, the holy grail of humbucking pickups.', 'Billy knew these pickups had magnetic coils inside, and that the vibration of a string hovering over the coils would excite their magnetic field, causing a current to flow and (stop me if this is getting too technical) in turn causing delightful guitar tone to come out of that amp over there.', '"We plugged Pearly Gates into an ohm meter," Billy tells me. "Seymour said, ‘Give me a Texas G.’ I strummed away, strummed away, and it appeared that the pickups that ride on my instrument are extremely robust. He said, ‘Gee whiz, I’m getting a reading hotter than I’ve ever seen.’ He said he’d had a hundred of these PAFs come through, that this was their standard test, trying to determine what these pickups potentially can put out, voltage wise."', 'Gibson’s original humbucking pickup, known as the PAF and introduced in 1957, is still the design that provokes more analysis, more copies, more half-truths, more arguments, and more money for a (hopefully) original set than any other type you care to name. With all the improvements in pickup design that have come along in the 60 years and more since Seth Lover presented the prototype to his bosses at Gibson, PAFs still command hushed reverence among those in the know.', 'PAF is shorthand for Patent Applied For, because that’s what a small black sticker on the base said. It remained in place until about 1962, when a new sticker with a patent number appeared there. Further changes around 1964 drew this era of Gibson’s humbucking development to a close, and to vintage fans, nothing can touch that original design.', 'Around 1971, Billy paid a visit to the Gibson factory in Kalamazoo. This was not what we’d now consider the golden period. But seven years or so after the end of that first great pickup era is closer than most of us have managed.', '"It was dead of winter, snowing like crazy, but we got the 50 cent tour, the whole bit, top to bottom," Billy recalls. "We went up to the room where they were making humbucking pickups. We saw the original machine that the famous PAFs were made on. Three ladies were operating the machine. It was a long rod, running left to right, with three wrapping points: one on the left end, one in the centre, and one on the right end. These ladies would slide a pickup bobbin down to the centre and put one on either end."', 'Billy says he watched as the women wound .42 gauge enamel wire onto a spool under a glass dome and that the wire was fed through a hole in the top of the dome. "They would put this wire on to each bobbin," he continues, "and they had a clicker, something like the winding stem on a wristwatch, connected to a counter. You could set how many turns you wanted the motor to spin. Once the wires were in place, they’d hit a switch, the motor would start spinning the rod, and the bobbins would be flying, dragging the wire off the spool."', 'He remembers a guide that went left to right—he reckons it was much like the gadget a fishing reel has, and it allowed the pickup wire to be laid into the bobbin in a fairly sophisticated way, left to right, right to left, and so on. When the clicker hit the defined number of turns, it would trigger the off switch.', '"What I noticed—and this is probably why some humbuckers sound different, with more oomph or power—is that the ladies had a footbrake, a long bar," Billy says. "When the motor stopped, it would make a noticeable click, so that they knew that particular bobbin was complete. They would step on the brake and it slowed the turning mechanism. And if they were talking, well—when we were there, we noticed they didn’t always step on the brake straight away, so another couple hundred turns got put on the bobbin. It was not an exact science."', 'It was not an exact science. This might well be the catchphrase that sums up the story of the pickup we have under our microscope. Fortunately, though, our guide among this rocky terrain is Thomas Nilsen, a Norwegian pickup specialist now resident in England. Thomas runs Cream T Pickups, and he employs science in the shape of his patented analogue spectrum recorder, which he uses to accurately scan and analyze old pickups. He’s worked with Billy and many other tone hounds who want to know what makes great pickups great.', 'Thomas grew up listening to Clapton and Green and Gibbons and the rest. "And when I was old enough to understand the basics of how an electric guitar was built and took my first one apart," he tells me, "I was on the hunt to find out how these great players got their amazing tone and sound. It didn’t take long before I understood it was all about going back to the pickups in their Les Paul guitars, specifically those made from 1958 to 1960. This was my base point, and it marked the start for my long journey that’s still going on today."', 'So, Thomas, why all the fuss surrounding the PAF humbuckers? The ones made from 1957 into the very early ‘60s. "Original PAFs have an open and very transparent sound," he explains, "and they react more honestly to your guitar’s tone settings, to how you attack the strings, and from there through your amps. This is what the original old PAFs have that no other pickups, say from the 1970 to ’90 era, have at all."', 'That sound is what many players and most modern pickup makers are chasing. And that sound is what creates the aura around original PAFs. So there’s some consistency there, Thomas? "Well, yes and no," he says. "The thing that is so interesting with PAF pickups is that none sound similar." He’s analyzed close on 60 sets of PAFs from 1957 to ’60, mostly examples taken from Gibson ES models and Les Pauls of the period.', '"Most of the PAFs from this era vary a lot regarding the types of magnet and the output," he says. "None are the same. The important thing to remember is that this was the period when Gibson was experimenting with the humbuckers in their quest to develop and make them better. I call it the test and trial period. So when I scan PAFs from this period, I find a big variation in how much bass, middle, and treble there is at the various frequencies. As I say, the consistent thing is that they are very open and transparent sounding pickups."', 'Surely all this fuss around the original PAFs indicates they are the greatest humbucking pickups ever made. "No," Thomas says, "a vintage PAF is the base and foundation of the greatest humbucker ever made. I know that some humbuckers being made now sound much better. Not many, but there are a handful of humbucker models made now that sound much better. That’s because some pickup makers, including me, have taken what was started back then and added more to it. We have the torch now and we’ll bring it further into new development."', 'Thomas’s particular torch is his Super Scanner. It grew from discussions he had with Billy about finding a way to accurately scan PAFs in a guitar. Few owners would welcome desoldering and removing these valuable items. So Thomas and a friend spent two years developing the scanner, and from that he created a handheld version, which he uses today to reveal information about the key assemblies inside a PAF.', '"The hardest and most challenging way for a modern maker to achieve that famous old vintage PAF tone is to replicate the winding pattern, the type of wire and tension used in that winding, and how the magnet is oriented," he says. "The rest is not helpful. If you try to use and source the correct covers with the right corners, the same plastic for the bobbins, and so on—all that has nothing to do with the sonic part of a PAF. I repeat: the only factors that decide the real sound of a PAF are type of wire, winding pattern, and magnet."', 'I imagine Thomas is not as concerned as some Burst nuts about the alleged sonic contribution made by the color of plastic—black or cream or both—used at various times for those bobbins inside a PAF. He laughs out loud and shakes his head.', '"I met a guy years ago," he says, "and he was dead serious, he said, ‘Hey Thomas, I can hear the difference between a one-ply pickguard and a three-ply pickguard.’ And I thought, you know, he must have this horrible life. Think about how much stuff he must hear around him every day as he just walks around. I wouldn’t like to be in his shoes."', 'What’s the biggest mystery that remains about PAF pickups? "When we were working on the PAFs in Billy’s Pearly Gates to create the WhiskerBucker pickup set," Thomas recalls, "I kept saying that, to be honest, these pickups are so special, that they are so far off the consistent things of all the other PAFs I’ve heard from that period.', '"That guitar and its pickups sound amazing compared to others. And Billy says, ‘Well, do you think it’s possible to find out who made them, to figure out which lady wound the pickups in my Pearly Gates?’ I said, ‘Billy, I think that option is long gone now.’ But it is a mystery that would be so good to solve. Wouldn’t that be great?"', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music. His books include Sunburst and The Gibson 335 Guitar Book.

I didn't know anything about Wessex, I'd never been there before. I knew Bill [Price] from when he used to work at Air.", 'And then Malcolm McLaren approached me about producing them. So they sent me some demos, I heard loads of stuff: Dave Goodman demos, Chris Spedding demos. I heard the stuff and I liked the material, it was as simple as that. So Malcolm fixed up for me to have a meeting with them, they came round to my house—minus John[ny Rotten]. Apparently Malcolm thought that meeting John might put me off the project.', 'Bill Price (BP): Chris was a very successful producer of rock records, and of bands that were not necessarily avant-garde, but were new things. When he was first involved in, say, Roxy Music, they were quite a futuristic thing. So I would have thought it was quite a logical choice.', 'Chris, did it seem a logical choice to you?', 'CT: I\'ve always taken on a job if I\'ve been interested in what I\'ve been asked to do, you know? The thing was: What are the songs like? And listening to the demos of stuff like "Pretty Vacant," they were great. That was the reason I decided I wanted to do it. If I\'d heard stuff and I\'d decided it was a load of rubbish, I wouldn\'t have done it. Once it comes down to that nitty-gritty of who asks me what I want to do, it always comes down to the same sort of thing in the end.', "At the time, some people seemed surprised to see your name on the Pistols album, when it eventually came out, considering you'd worked with The Beatles and so on.", "CT: Yeah, I can see that, because obviously people's ideas of what you are come purely from what they read on the back of record covers, and they put you in a certain bag. Later on in that year, I was doing Paul McCartney in the afternoon and the Sex Pistols at night. Real chalk and cheese, but I love that. That appeals to me.", 'So the first time you two worked with the Pistols was late in 1976?', "CT: Yes, and the reason for working with Bill, simply, was that they had been working in Wessex, I think they'd been doing that with Tim Friese-Greene engineering and Dave Goodman producing. They were there, they seemed comfortable with that, so I said if you want to stay there, in that case I'd like Bill to engineer it, because I know him and I don't know the studio. That was the reason that I started working with Bill.", 'BP: I have some notes here, because I\'ve gone back over our tape-library records [at Wessex studio]. So, on November 6 and 7, 1976, Chris and I recorded "Anarchy In The U.K." for the first time. Then we recorded it again a bit later, and my note says we did 19 takes of it [laughs].', "Interestingly enough, it had been recorded at the same studio [Wessex], but with Dave Goodman supposedly producing, which was paid for by EMI Records. That was on October 16, 1976. Dave was their sound guy, to a certain extent. He was a part-time producer and engineer and was involved with the band from their earliest days. He was very good, I think. They tried recording in cheap studios, in home studios, in clubs with live equipment, so they'd already tried recording their stuff. But I think they just discovered that it's not going to produce something more credible just because it's a backstreet recording.", 'Dave Goodman recorded this very interesting bunch of songs in October: "I Wanna Be Me," "17," "No Feelings," "New York," "Anarchy," "Stepping Stone," "No Fun," "Problems," "Substitute," "Pretty Vacant," "Satellite," "No Lip," and "Submission." That\'s virtually their entire repertoire, and possibly with the addition of "Bodies" and maybe one other song remained pretty much all they ever produced.', 'So Chris and I recorded "Anarchy" twice, and also on that batch of sessions we recorded "No Future," which is a song whose title changes quite a lot [it became "God Save The Queen"]. There was "No Future," "No Feelings," "Pretty Vacant," and "Stepping Stone", as well as "Anarchy"—that was the first batch of sessions. "Anarchy" was then released as the single on EMI Records [on November 26, 1976, with Goodman\'s "I Wanna Be Me" as b-side]', 'CT: When we did "Anarchy," in other words the first sessions, that was like real—what\'s it all about! Specially when it came to the point of actually working with John. We put the backing track down, and I still hadn\'t met him. It was all getting a little bit strange, shenanigans going on already. He came in to do his vocal and he was really disgruntled—because he\'d been sort of left out of things, and he didn\'t know about it. So already there was a bit of an atmosphere.', 'Bit by bit I think we managed to sort it out. I know at one point we went down to Ramport [studio, south London] and we tried working on the vocal there a bit as well—it was like, "Where\'s available?" Found Ramport, went there for an afternoon, and I think did another couple of odd guitar bits, too.', 'Was Johnny aware of your track record?', 'CT: Oh, very much so. That came out at that very first meeting, when we came to do those vocals. I remember saying, "Shall we try doing the vocal now?" And John said [disgruntled tone]: "Well that\'s what I\'m \'ere for." Then we went out into the studio, and he started howling his way through this, just a yell from beginning to end. It\'s like, "Christ almighty, how do we sort this one out? The fun really starts now."', 'We\'d already spent a long time putting the track down and overdubbing. So I went out there and said something to him, and he said, "Well, you\'re the one with the track record—you sort it out." I thought Fucking hell. I think he—and everybody—they were a bit bemused by what was expected of them by this time.', 'Once John had had a go at the vocals, he then became very involved in it all. They were really into making a great record, definitely. All this thing about being told to do the track without the singer, it made him out to be some fucking monster or something. It turns out he\'s totally into it. We ended up having to mix it through the night, pretty much. A lot of them were kipping upstairs. And John came down about five in the morning, he\'s listening to it and he\'s absolutely knocked out. "That\'s great," he said. "That\'s our anthem."', 'Did it seem special to you, or just another session?', 'BP: Chris and I were working on other projects at the same time. It was ostensibly like any other session, in that with any session you have to do whatever is required by the musician, by the band. Every session is a special case.', "Johnny Rotten was sort of anti-establishment—well, that was his guise. I don't think his true feelings were. But the whole image of the band was anti-establishment. And on a smaller scale, they were against the recognized process of recording. They were against the way the old fogeys went about things. They were against the institutions of major recording studios, of experienced engineers and good producers like Chris with his track record. Those things were part of the music business establishment, and it became Sex Pistols philosophy to be against it. They made that quite obvious, in no uncertain terms.", 'How did you know what they wanted? Did you have any preliminary discussions with them?', "BP: I hadn't seen them live, but as he said, Chris had. I'd heard a few demos, and I knew a three-piece always requires a lot of work with the sound, just because it can sound so small, so empty. The first time they came in the studio was the first time I'd met them.", 'Who played bass on those first sessions?', 'BP: I believe Glen [Matlock, bass] was there on the first recording we did of "Anarchy." I\'m a bit vague if he was there the second time we did it. Basically, what used to happen a lot of the time was Steve [Jones, guitar] used to play bass. So quite a lot of the time it was a two-piece. Quite often they used to play with just Steve and Paul [Cook, drums]. Steve would overdub the bass part as if it was another guitar part.', "When Sid [Vicious, bass] joined the band [in February 1977], I think he came for one session, and then I think he had hepatitis or jaundice for maybe a two-month period, which coincided with most of their recording period. So there weren't a lot of occasions when Sid was available to record anyway.", 'The Pistols were sacked by EMI in January \'77, after all the fuss in the press about swearing at Bill Grundy on TV and so on, but they move on, and the next single is "God Save The Queen." They were signed and then sacked by A&M in March, and signed to Virgin in May.', 'BP: Yes, my notes say Chris and I did that single here at Wessex on March 4, 1977. We did "EMI," "Did You No Wrong" [the b-side], "No Future" [a.k.a. "God Save The Queen"], and "Pretty Vacant." Glitterbest [Malcolm McLaren\'s company] paid for that. So that obviously represented a change in record company structure, shall we say [laughs].', 'The earlier sessions were paid for by EMI, presumably.', 'BP: They were direct EMI sessions, yes. EMI paid for the Dave Goodman recordings, as well, and for our original pair of "Anarchy" sessions.', 'I remember I had to go down to Pye studios with [mastering engineer] Malcolm Davies to re-cut "God Save The Queen." When seven-inch records are pressed, the master they\'re pressed from isn\'t seven inches—it\'s originally cut on to either a 10-inch or a 14-inch lacquer and reduced down at the factory. Some factories require a 10-inch lacquer and other factories require a 14-inch lacquer. Because of something like that Bill Grundy incident, the ladies at the factory had gone on strike and refused to put the record into the bag. So we had to go and re-cut to a different size lacquer so that it could be shifted to a different factory [laughs].', 'CT: I remember we did those four, including "God Save The Queen," in one afternoon. It was just Steve and Paul—and it\'s difficult to tell when you\'ve got just drums and guitar. No mistakes there, but you need the bass in there, or some more stuff, to find out if there\'s anything dodgy going on. But it just seemed fine, so we went on to the next one, and then the next one. Then I said to Steve, "Do you fancy putting the bass on, just so we know where we are?" I said to Bill, "Take this, in case there\'s a few good bits."', "Steve just played the root note of the chord all the way through, and it was great! I thought, That's it. And we did four backing tracks in an afternoon, literally in about two hours. Paul and Steve used to knock around together, and they'd go through the set probably five times a day, just the two of them. So they were completely locked in to this original guitar part and the drums—it just never altered, you know? That's why it was so fast. Bang! Done!", 'BP: The band came here to Wessex around that time, I think the same day as the A&M signing party, maybe to mix "God Save The Queen." They arrived in an A&M limo when the school-kids were on their break [at the school next door to Wessex studio]. Soon as the kids saw this limo, they clung at the fence trying to get over it—they didn\'t recognize the band, it was just the sight of the limo.', 'The school mistress came out, started screaming at the kids to get back in class. Johnny got out the car and told her, "Fuck off, you fascist old bastard!" She rang the police. She recognized the band! She must have used the word riot, because a Transit [van] full of about 14 police pulled up and bailed out.', "We tucked the band in a little studio round the back, and they fell asleep. They'd arrived with handfuls of sandwiches, half-drunk bottles of vodka in their pockets, sat down on the small couch in the studio and promptly fell asleep. So I entertained these policemen in number one control room for about half an hour—I'd been told to keep them occupied for a bit—on the premise that absolutely everybody is interested in how a 24-track recording desk works [laughs].", 'They appeared to be quite interested, so I just went down the channel strip, starting at the mic gain control, and explained to them how the desk worked. After about half an hour, six of them were still interested and didn\'t want me to stop. Eventually it was, "Well, doesn\'t seem to be much happening here," and they shuffled off.', 'The credit on the Bollocks album says "Produced by Chris Thomas or Bill Price." I don\'t think I\'ve seen an "or" credit like that before. Why is it like that?', "BP: That's to be taken quite literally.", 'CT: We\'d mixed "God Save The Queen" and that didn\'t come out, and we had "Pretty Vacant" and it was obvious that that wasn\'t gonna come out, so then I was going off to work on something else. That\'s when I suggested that Bill could carry on without me, because it had got to the point where they could just go in and record it, especially if it was minus Sid.', 'So I thought that Bill could do that—and he did about four or five songs on his own. That was the "or" credit. See if you can spot the difference! I don\'t think it would make any difference one way or the other.', "BP: I used to work a lot with Chris, and still do, as an engineer. What happened in this case was that in April '77 I started recording the album tracks, without Chris. Initially, there was absolutely no complication or difficulty about it at all.", "Chris had been contracted to do however many singles, and he wasn't in a position to be able to record the rest of the album. So Malcolm had a meeting with the band and myself and it was decided that I would record the album. And then Chris's singles tracks would be added to that. So it was very simple—initially.", 'Looking at my notes, I did "Problems," "No Feelings," "Liar," "17," "EMI," "Satellite," "New York," "Submission," and "Holidays In The Sun." Paid for by Glitterbest, and we worked for two or three weeks on those. And then Virgin started paying for things, after they signed the band [in May]. Chris then came in, and we started recording a new single, presumably to go out with the album. And this is when things started to get immensely complicated.', 'When did you record that potential single?', 'BP: That was June 11, 1977, for "Holidays In The Sun" and "Bodies." "Bodies" was different in that it\'s a song that was written after everything else—it was a new song, as opposed to the set that had been in existence since the band started.', 'CT: With "Bodies" I remember mentioning an orchestra, and maybe trying to do it live. I thought that would set the cat amongst the pigeons, to have the Royal Philharmonic. And then of course later they used strings on "My Way," which Bill did. But I was very happy with the way "Bodies" turned out, it was actually one of my favorites of the lot.', 'Bill, you said the album started to get complicated. What happened?', "BP: The album still had not been compiled. From that session in June until October, as well as making that single, I did versions of tracks that Chris had rejected as singles, which Chris had made as singles and hadn't been released, I'd done album versions of them. Some of the songs that I'd done on the album Chris had decided to record as potential singles.", 'And then this argument started between, I suppose, Johnny and Malcolm as to what should go on the album—how many tracks it should have, whether it should have all their previous singles on it, which versions, whose version, which recording of what songs.', "I must have made up that album about eight times. And I cut it three times with different running orders. I've got the test pressings, all with different orders, and I can't even remember which is the one that went out [laughs].", 'I remember arriving back from holiday, there was an announcement over the speakers at Victoria Station for me—it\'s a call from Malcolm [imitates Malcolm shouting:] "Have you got a pen and paper there? What we want is \'Anarchy\', \'17\' … !" And the lady who is now my wife wasn\'t at all pleased, because I had to go straight into the studio and work all night to put it in yet another order, and then go down the next morning to cut it. Again.', 'After that, we did some overdubbing at Air in London on "EMI," "Submission," and "Satellite," between August 8 and 12, 1977, with Sid playing bass. I seem to remember we did quite a lot of recording without Sid, because generally he was ill. Now he reappeared on the scene, so we put him on a few songs where he hadn\'t played on the original recordings—he wanted to be on it, being the bass player in the band. It became slightly arbitrary as to who was on the finished record, because the sound was a blend of something Sid had played and something Steve had played—you couldn\'t really credit either of them as the bass player on it.', 'CT: I remember the first time Sid came down to the studio, we had something set up, and he went up to the board, moved all the faders, said, "Is this where the music comes out?," or some stupid comment. Even the band sort of went, "Oh, fuck," you know? Not funny. That was the thing, you almost had to tolerate him.', 'What do you remember in particular about the process of recording?', "BP: Steve's guitar sound was very special, but I can't really give credit to anybody but Steve for that. He had a Fender Twin Reverb and he had a magic way of setting it—he turned all the knobs full up—and he had some very respectable Gibsons indeed, very good guitars. He had his own novel way of tuning a guitar, and his own novel chord shapes, and he instantly produced the Steve Jones sound. It was very easy to record.", "Steve had an immaculate sense of timing, and a lot of the Pistols riffs were his riffs. I'm not a guitar expert, and a lot of guitarists will say oh, I know where Jones got that one from or this one from, but they were always very obscure sources which I couldn't be sure about. As far as I was concerned, in terms of general music that most people had heard, they were all fairly original riffs. And Steve deserves a lot of credit for that.", 'Did Malcolm get involved in the recording?', "BP: At the start, Malcolm would be running to and fro, closeted with alternate members of the band quite frequently. But he was normally concerned about the vocals. He criticised the end results in a very non-technical and very helpful way, in that he would purely think of it as Johnny singing with a noise. And if there was a good point in the lyric, he didn't want that being missed, but neither did he want Johnny to sound like an arsehole stuck out on the top of something. He thought of it as singer and accompaniment. Which is a very good way to think of most records, actually.", 'The guitars and the drums sound especially good on the Pistols records.', "BP: With the drums, we did something that's fairly routine now but was maybe a bit special then. It relied on putting the drums fairly central in that big room at Wessex, separating everything else, and staggering mics at different distances from the drums. That means the sound of the drums arrives at successive microphones later in time.", "And in order to tighten up the front edge of that line, we then gated all of those microphones together. So you've got an instant attack from all of them, but a very muddled decay. It's a fairly standard technique now.", "We arrived at it between the two of us, not consciously copying anybody. There were a few David Bowie tracks we'd heard that on, that sounded as if they'd used that technique. It's one of those things where six different people invented it at about the same time. We sort of invented it ourselves, but I'm sure lots of other people were inventing it themselves, as well. You had to use a lot of elements, and you had lots of little things to fine-tune which were all interactive, until you got the sound you wanted. Changing one thing changed everything else. And it suited that band.", 'Did Paul appreciate that technique?', "BP: Paul started off almost totally incompetent, but very willing. He ended up like a fine rock drummer—by being really forced to work hard. It wasn't easy, that's for sure, getting drum tracks. Paul wasn't an experienced drummer, and he learned a hell of a lot in the course of being in the band. By the time I worked with him in The Professionals [Steve and Paul's post-Pistols band], Paul was a really superb, tight, rock-steady drummer.", "At the start, he had all these ideas, knew what he wanted to play and what he wanted to do, and that didn't change terribly much. But his facility to do three minutes of that, correctly, wasn't very good to start with. The hard work of the earlier sessions was getting a drum take together. Chris and I would do a lot of multitrack editing. That's how the drum tracks were achieved, with multitrack editing.", 'For example, the 19 takes of "Anarchy," plus occasional injections of tandoori chicken and Heineken and TV and pool—I think we spent longer editing it than the band took playing it. We would sit playing it back over and over and over again, three or four reels of tape—Chris and I would sit there making notes, trying to get some ideas.', 'In a three-minute song, we could do upwards of 20 multitrack edits on a two-inch tape. Sometimes there might just be two or three, depending on how good Paul was on that occasion, but sometimes it would be a very large number.', 'CT: That\'s exactly where I thought the problem lay on "Anarchy," with the drums. But it wasn\'t, because I think that was the only track we did with Glen. Then, when we jump ahead to the future stuff, when we started to work with Steve and Paul on their own, it was suddenly, "Hang on a minute, they played that and there was nothing wrong, take one—what?" In other words, the problem was between the bass–drums interplay.', 'So, we got a backing track down, then we did a lot of guitar overdubs, because I was interested in arranging the thing a fair bit. Steve already had a few ideas, and then we added a few more. There were a lot of guitar parts on "Anarchy," about 16 or something.', 'It seems the combination of Steve and Paul playing together formed the initial structure for a lot of the recordings you did.', "BP: Yes, for more or less everything. We'd probably start off using about 12 tracks of drums and one track of guitar, as a backing track. As the thing developed we'd shrink those drum tracks by mixing down to, say, six tracks, or discarding drum tracks that had been recorded that we didn't want to use.", 'Steve would add on a couple more basic guitar tracks to his original guitar track, maybe the same, maybe with subtle variations. Then we might do tracks picking out certain elements of the song, tuning the sound to suit those elements. So if Steve had some damped eight-in-the-bar sections, they would be laid down on the basic track, and then we would add an overdub where that very harmonic-y, damped sound was emphasized, in order to pick that element out. If there were any very open-chord sections, we might do single-note sections to pick out the bottom line. The elements within the original guitar part would be picked out and recorded on separate tracks, with the sound adjusted to suit that particular part of it.', 'Chris, it sounds like the band in general were becoming more interested and involved in the recording as time went on.', "CT: Definitely. In the studio, Steve, John, and Paul approached it quite seriously. If John wasn't doing anything, he might go off and get pissed, but if he came to do his vocal he wanted to do it good, and he took plenty of care over it. He was great to work with, actually. By this time they were a very frustrated rock 'n' roll band. They wanted to get out on the road and play, and they wanted their singles to come out.", "It was at that point that I started going off the boil a little bit as well, it just seemed pointless to make records, dash in, got to do this, got to do that—and then the thing doesn't come out. And the band were really cheesed off as well. Underneath it all was a very straightforward thing, where they were working hard to make a great record, enjoying that process, and wanting to see it come out and do well.", 'BP: At the start, Johnny in particular was more or less determined not to like anything, he\'d listen to any playback and say, "Well that sounds a pile of shit to me." He definitely wanted to be like that. But I do think his attitude wore off when he realized the band was being recorded and it was sounding quite good, and it was coming out of record players sounding like "Anarchy"—the job was being done. So I assume he sort of grudgingly accepted it.', 'Chris is a very good vocal producer, very good at getting performances out of people. I think possibly Johnny genuinely began to appreciate that he was in the hands of somebody who knew what he was doing when he started trying to get vocals down. I think that might have mellowed him a bit. It was all a little bit of a game, anyway.', "CT: And it's funny, because in some circles they're a very under-estimated band. Steve's great—he basically did everything. By the end, Steve was roaring, he definitely wanted to be a rock star by then. He was away, and he was doing a great job.", 'BP: Johnny did accept that he had to have professionals doing it. And that amateurs needed to be recorded by professionals. By the time we ended up putting the album together, I think his fight was with Malcolm and not with us, anyway. Things had changed a lot, I think, for Johnny over that period of time. The conflict was a bit more real. It was all a bit theoretical when he started.', "But as soon as the money started rolling in, I think the conflict had brass tacks involved. To be quite honest, I'm sure it was all about money. Malcolm started off as the jolly Svengali, and was somewhat shifty by the time they parted company.", 'Did you get paid?', 'BP: We got a certain amount of money, but because it was so chaotic it was not payment in the way record producers normally like to get paid, by auditable accounts, at all. An arbitrary sum of money changed hands.', "You said amateurs need to be recorded by professionals, Bill. How much of your work is with musicians who don't know much about being in a studio?", "BP: The majority of the studio business revolves around beginners. Most definitely. There's a hundred thousand bands in this world, and any recording studio, I'd say 90 percent of it is devoted to people the general public's never heard of. There's not many people that spend their time doing Elton John. I mean, I've done a lot of work with Elton, but that would be maybe six weeks of the year. The rest of the year I'd be working with people you've never heard of.", "The majority of money made by recording studios is on things that don't sell. It's unfortunate, but fair enough. I mean we're not all recording Fleetwood Mac all the time [laughs].", "Being good with people who aren't used to a studio is a very important part of working in a studio. To a certain extent, Johnny Rotten was right in having this attitude of not wanting to be shoved through a sausage machine like the regular process.", 'When you record people, you have to treat them as people. and if they\'re inexperienced, you have to take them through things gently. You don\'t want to go: "Ha ha ha, don\'t you know what that is? Oh, everybody knows that!" That attitude just doesn\'t work. Some people do that, but it\'s unprofessional. If a band walks into a professional recording studio, they\'re not expected to be experts in recording. They expect a service, and professionalism is a part of it.', 'Was it a happy experience, on the whole? Would you want to do something like that again?', "BP: Funnily enough, I was doing something almost exactly like it until about five o'clock this morning [in October 1984]. I'm working with a band called Ellery Bop, from Liverpool, who are fairly punky. They're looked after by Bill Drummond, and this is his latest signing, to WEA.", "The Pistols, though, it wasn't an unhappy album really. There's always personality conflicts in studios. There were no really heavy ones. I've had a lot heavier. Sid was never any great problem. I used to worry about him, not eating and stuff. I'd bring in pork pies, because he looked a bit skinny. Johnny wasn't too bad, either. A bit arty, a bit posey. The rest of them were fairly straight up Londoners.", 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

Our conclusion is inescapable: the early inhabitants of these caves must have gathered around the images for chanting or singing." - Ted Gioia, Music: A Subversive History', 'Caves, cathedrals, concert halls—wherever music is made, the space itself is a contributing player.', 'As Gioia writes in Music, there\'s reason to believe that the early humans who painted the Lascaux caves in modern-day France chose the site of their artwork and rituals exactly where the chambers would resonate the most. One can imagine the combined effect of the paintings, the firelight, and the reverberant chants, an overwhelming mix of sound, light, and movement. Steven Errede, a professor who studies the physics of music, has suggested these were the first "rock" concerts (pun his).', "Other old, though much less old, examples are the choral performances of Gregorio Allegri's Miserere in the 17th and 18th century Vatican, where the lead would direct his highest note to the most resonant spot of the Sistine Chapel. Since then, many choirs, opera singers, classical musicians, and countless others have learned to sing or perform in ways that complement the acoustics of a room, while acousticians have designed performance halls to heighten this sense of resonance.", 'This is reverb, traditionally speaking. But ask a musician creating rock, pop, hip-hop, or other contemporary music today what reverb is, and the things that come to mind probably aren\'t the effects of physical spaces. They\'re plugins and pedals or settings on an amplifier. So how\'d we get from actual halls and chambers to choosing "hall" or "chamber" at the flick of a dial?', "Reverb's Jim Tuerk and YouTube's Rob Scallon tackled the question in a nearly hour-long video, sharing the long and short of long and short tails, and taking us from natural reverb through plates, springs, pedals, and more.", "If you've ever recorded yourself in an untreated room like a garage or basement, you've probably encountered unflattering echoes. Maybe you didn't even notice while performing, but as you listen to the playback, the effect is glaring. You can hear the boominess of the room or the flutter of reverberations off the walls.", 'From the dawn of the recording age, this is a problem that professional recording studios have worked to solve through design, building materials, acoustic treatment, and expert mic placement. Live rooms that resonate just the right amount, vocal chambers with deadened walls, diffusers behind the mixing board—all of these are ways to control the reverberations that would otherwise roam untamed.', 'The reverb that remains is the sonic fingerprint of a studio. Spaces like Chess Records at 2120 South Michigan Avenue or the famously sloped floor at Sun Records imparted a certain character to any song that was made in them.', 'But once studios learned how to tame most of the naturally occurring echoes, producers and engineers wanted to add some back in, at their discretion.', 'The earliest artificial reverb effects were still empty rooms, but they were rooms built and used specifically for their echoes.', 'The origin story of echo chambers (or reverberation rooms) takes place at Universal Recording studio in Chicago. On a 1947 session for The Harmonicats\' "Peg o\' My Heart," Bill Putnam set up a speaker and a microphone in the studio\'s bathroom. Capturing the sound that reflected off the hard tile floor and walls, he then mixed that wet signal back in with the dry.', "This same basic idea was, thankfully, taken out of the bathroom and replicated. Sunset Sound, Abbey Road, Capitol Studios, and Motown are just a few of the famous studios whose echo chambers added space to beloved hits. In the same way that a concert hall's construction determines a certain sonic character, these echo chambers too impart a signature sound. And today, the specific sound of many of these famous rooms have been distilled into branded reverb plugins.", 'The earliest reverb machines to break free of a physical room were plate reverbs—though you still basically need a spare room to fit them.', "In the video above, you can see and hear a plate reverb at Chicago's Electrical Audio studio. A large sheet of metal suspended by clips, a plate reverb works by sending an audio signal to the plate and using pickups to record the affected signal. The sound reverberates through the metal sheet and decays.", 'The EMT 140 was the first commercially built plate reverb. Engineers gravitated toward them because of their ease of use and the greater amount of control they offered when compared to echo chambers. They also have their own unique sound, with a bright attack and a decay that darkens as it gets quieter. For that reason, "plate reverb" is a common setting on any number of digital pedals and reverb plugins today.', "However, full-sized plate reverbs are the size of a small car and are sensitive to the sounds and vibrations around them. (For this reason, Electrical Audio keeps its plate reverb deep in the basement.) They can also be quite expensive to buy on the vintage market. So for musicians looking to add reverb to their individual instruments, plate reverbs are entirely impractical. But that's where spring reverbs enter the soundscape.", "The first instrument to come with its own supply of reverb was the Hammond organ, but it wasn't until the Hammond spinoff company Accutronics created the Type 4 spring reverb that it became available as a standalone unit.", 'The idea really took off in popular music, however, once Leo Fender built the Fender Reverb Tank and started to add them into his line of amplifiers like the Vibroverb and Twin Reverb. You can hear these spring reverbs getting a workout all over early \'60s surf rock, with Dick Dale\'s "Misirlou" being the primary example of how spring reverb can transform a riff.', "A spring reverb works in a way that's similar to a plate reverb. Instead of a sheet of metal, however, the original sound is sent through springs (sometimes a single spring, but usually two or more). While this allows spring units to be relatively small and easily added to amplifier chassis, it also means the sound is very different from plates or echo chambers: brighter, thinner, and, well, more springy.", "For this reason, while it sounds great on guitars and can sound great with other instruments, it's not usually the first choice in recording studios when engineers think about treating a mix... that is, unless it's an AKG BX20.", "This overbuilt, large format spring reverb acts differently than the spring reverbs you find in an amplifier. The springs are bigger, there are more of them, and it sounds more lush and full than the traditional boing of a spring. Because of that, the teak-wood box of the BX20, BX10, and BX15 from the '70s can be found in virtually every professional studio.", "The thrill of using springs in non-standard, unexpected ways has driven the creation of a number of new devices. Gamechanger Audio's Light Pedal combines spring reverb with infrared optical sensors, which catch and allow you to experiment with additional harmonics and noise from its reverb tank. And the desktop KNAS Ekdahl Moisturizer keeps the springs exposed, so that you can manipulate them directly.", 'In 1976, EMT took what it learned from its plate reverbs and its smaller diaphragm-based EMT 240 and created the EMT 250, the first digital reverb unit. With four levers and a row of buttons on top of a large paper-shredder-like enclosure, it looks far different from what digital reverbs would become, but you could set decay times, treat high and low frequencies with different amounts of reverb, and add other effects as well.', 'As digital outboard gear progressed, digital reverbs were more commonly built as rackmount units or as algorithms within multi-effects. Different boxes rose and fell from popularity, with these digital reverbs helping to define eras and mini-eras within pop music just as analog reverbs defined previous ones.', 'The prime example of this is the AMS RMX16 Digital Reverberation System. One of its many algorithms was the "Non Lin 2"—a gated reverb that gave the Phil Collins\' "In the Air Tonight" drum sound to whatever audio you sent through it. Prince, Kate Bush, Hall & Oates, Duran Duran, and many other famous artists used the effect throughout the \'80s, to the point where any use of it now is automatically a sonic throwback to that time.', "Today, of course, digital reverbs don't even need rack space. Most DAWs come with their own plugins that offer plate-, spring-, and room-like sounds (at varying levels of believability). Companies like Universal Audio, Waves, and countless others offer emulations of nearly every specific reverb unit or echo chamber of note that's ever existed. And other, stranger plugins go beyond the bounds of known reverberations.", 'But digital reverbs have also been put to great use within reverb pedals—from mainstays like the Boss RV-3 to the new crop of inventive reverb and delay-reverb effects from Strymon, Meris, Walrus Audio, Chase Bliss Audio, EarthQuaker Devices, Source Audio, Empress, and other boutique builders.', "By and large, if you find a pedal with reverb in it, it's a digital reverb. But that's not always the case. Anasounds, Crazy Tube Circuits, Danelectro, Spaceman, and others have made true spring reverbs in pedal-sized enclosures.", "So whether you're grabbing a pedal, calling up a plugin, or creating a bathroom echo chamber of your own, there's an embarrassment of reverb riches available. You can hear many of the units mentioned here in the video at the top of the piece, and you can find most for sale on Reverb.", 'Interested in learning more about the history of effects?

The Tokyo-based group used synthesizers, drum machines, and other electronic hardware to create a body of work that is still lauded to this day for its combination of catchy melodies, tight rhythms, and experimental drive.', 'What is less talked about, however, is the gear they used and, specifically, how they put it all together to create a music that few had attempted before.', "The history of the band's gear-use is also a history of the development of synthesizers and other electronic instruments. The band's first vital period of work spanned the late 1970s, when American companies dominated synth manufacturing, through the 1980s, with the rise of Japanese companies like Korg and Roland. But the band's story also brings in new developments in digital sampling, types of synthesis, and music recording.", 'Right on the cutting edge (and often even out in front of it), YMO were never shy to embrace new technologies, and this informed their musical output.', "Let's take a look at the history of the band through their gear.", 'The YMO story starts with Haruomi Hosono. By the late 1970s, Hosono had already been active in the Japanese music scene for a decade, having played in rock bands Apryl Fool and the very successful Happy End and was then in the midst of a solo career, releasing a string of quirky albums that indulged his passion for Tin Pan Alley and exotica, the post-World War musical genre popular in the United States that substituted the reality of Pacific locales for an imagined tropical island life. It was the latter that would lead to the formation of Yellow Magic Orchestra.', 'Paraiso, released in the spring of 1978, saw Hosono getting deep into Hawaiian and Okinawan-flavored exotica. To bring his vision to life, he needed some session musicians, and so he called in drummer Yukihiro Takahashi, formerly of the Sadistic Mika Band, who had toured the UK with Roxy Music. Also making the session scene at the time was university student Ryuichi Sakamoto, who came on board for a few songs.', 'While not a strictly electronic affair, the album does use an ARP Odyssey (a firm future YMO favorite) and the then-cutting-edge (and still pretty mind-blowing) Yamaha CS-80. Hosono dubbed his backing group the Yellow Magic Band and the seeds were sown for future greatness. The three would work again on Hosono\'s Pacific (also 1978), which featured an early version of "Cosmic Surfin\'," later re-recorded for YMO\'s self-titled debut.', "Released only a month before the YMO debut, Ryuichi Sakamoto's own debut solo album, Thousand Knives, is worth a mention as it features quite a few of the same pieces of gear—as well as the playing techniques—that would be heard on YMO's inaugural release.", 'Teetering on the line between avant-garde and pop, Thousand Knives features three songs later redone by YMO in various ways: "Plastic Bamboo," "The End Of Asia," and the title track, which would eventually feature prominently on 1981\'s BGM. The complexity of the harmonies on the record earned Sakamoto the nickname of Professor.', 'Thousand Knives the album featured a number of the top synthesizers of the day: Moog Minimoog and Micromoog, Korg VC-10 Vocoder and SQ-10 sequencer, and Pollard Syndrum.', 'Although polyphonic synths were still in their infancy, the album features two, an Oberheim Eight Voice (soon to be a staple of their live show) and a Korg PS-3100, a fully polyphonic and accordingly bank-breaking synth.', 'The album is also notable for the appearance of programmer Hideki Matsutake, who would come to be known as the unofficial fourth member of YMO. A former apprentice of Moog modular master Isao Tomita, he was brought in to play his Moog IIIc and program the Roland MC-8 sequencer.', 'Released in 1977, the MC-8 was the first microprocessor-controlled CV/gate sequencer and a huge step up from the eight and 16-note step sequencers available at the time. It had eight CV/gate outputs for note and filter control and was even capable of polyphonic sequencing.', '"I used to know Ikutaro Kakehashi, who is the developer and founder of Roland," Matsutake told the website Stereoklang. "So I… purchased [an MC-8] on the day of public commercial launch at an ordinary music instrument shop. At that time I could not play a keyboard so I had been looking for something to replace it. The MC-8 was exactly such an automated instrument. It created the sound of the future."', 'Notes could ostensibly be played in live but this was apparently difficult to achieve so most users—including Matsutake—input note information in the form of numerical data via an adding machine-like keypad. For each note, the machine required a number to indicate note position on the keyboard as well as timing and gate length.', '"I don\'t think you need a good mathematical brain [to use the MC-8]," he explained in an interview with Electricity Club. "Maybe some rudimentary arithmetic helps—addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. You need to be able to work these out quickly. Plus, touch-typing skills are vital. Remember, you need to enter three parameters to program a single note so you\'ve got to be quick yet accurate. I practiced a lot."', 'The MC-8 would be a major contributor to the future sound of Yellow Magic Orchestra.', 'Hosono convinced Sakamoto and Takahashi to join him, and Yellow Magic Orchestra was born. Their first hit, a cover of Martin Denny\'s "Firecracker" and an extension of the exotica sound that Hosono explored on Paraiso and Pacific, set the tone for their self-titled debut album: largely instrumental electronic music informed as much by Kraftwerk as by traditional Asian-style melodies.', 'Their rhythmic power came from two sources: the drumming of Yukihiro Takahashi, and the MC-8 programming of Hideki Matsutake, now firmly ensconced in the studio with the band. Takahashi used regular drums and augmented them with a Pollard Syndrum Quad, playing to a click track provided by the MC-8. This would be at the heart of their sound until the TR-808 arrived in 1980. The rhythmic combination of tight yet funky resulted in "Firecracker" getting plays by hip-hop DJs like Afrika Bambaataa and helped the album climb into the Billboard Top 200 and R&B Album charts.', 'As with Thousand Knives, Yellow Magic Orchestra again featured the Korg PS-3100 and VC-10 vocoder, ARP Odyssey and Minimoog, and Oberheim Eight Voice. The CS-80 was replaced by a Moog Polymoog. Given that Sakamoto used the Polypedal controller on their first world tour, we can probably assume he also employed it for the album.', 'To capitalize on their growing popularity, the band embarked on a world tour that saw them play at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles. The performance was recorded and later released on video and DVD, and on various albums. In 2014, the entire stage rig was recreated at the Tokyo International Exhibition Center. Here is a breakdown of the gear they had on stage with them at the time according to the exhibition.', 'Facing the stage, at the front left was Sakamoto and his keyboards, which included a Roland VP-330 Vocoder Plus and Polymoog and Polypedal controller. On top of the Polymoog were two ARP Odysseys, one Revision 2 and one Revision 3. He also had a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5. Behind him in his effects rack, a Yamaha Analog Delay E1010 is clearly visible. He also had a Roland RE-201 Space Echo and Dimension D SDD-320 chorus rack, and an MXR Stereo Chorus.', 'To the right of Sakamoto was Takahashi, playing a drum kit consisting of a Pollard Syndrum Quad and ULT-Sound DS-4, along with traditional acoustic drums.', 'On the front right was Hosono, playing a Music Man bass guitar and an ARP Odyssey revision 2 for synth basslines.', 'Live, YMO filled out their sound with additional musicians. On this tour, this included Kazumi Watanabe on guitar, Akiko Yano on Prophet-5 and Oberheim Eight Voice, and the ever-present Hideki Matsutake, whose station was dominated by his towering Moog IIIc. He also had a Boss DR-55 drum machine, Musitronics Mu-Tron Bi-Phase, Yamaha Analog Delay E1010, Moog Ten Band Graphic Equalizer, and Sequential Circuits Model 700 Programmer, a sequencer with envelope controls made to run ARP and Moog synths.', "Additionally, Matsutake was in charge of keeping two Roland MC-8s running and had a stack of cassettes and two cassette players to load songs from, something that didn't always work perfectly. In fact, Roland's engineers were apparently surprised that YMO used MC-8s live, given that they were only designed for studio use.", '"You just could not predict what would go wrong," Matsutake told Electricity Club. "Luckily, the MC-8 only stopped twice during live performances. When that happened, everyone in the band knew there was nothing I or anyone could do, so the rest of the musicians went ahead and played without the sequenced parts."', 'While this setup certainly represented the cream of the crop of electronic instruments at the time, the paucity of Japanese instruments and reliance on American gear is noteworthy. Japan had not yet become the electronic instrument powerhouse it would in the 1980s.', 'In 1979, the band returned to the studio to lay down the tracks for their second album, Solid State Survivor. Gone were the exotica and disco sounds, replaced by more up-to-date strains. They had been listening to new wave bands like Devo, and this is apparent on the angular cover of The Beatles\' "Day Tripper."', 'Less is known about the gear used on this album, although Matsutake and his MC-8 were definitely present. The album also featured a Roland VP-330 Vocoder Plus, which can be heard on the opener, "Technopolis" (and on the next album, Multiplies, as well). It\'s also safe to assume that the band had a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 on hand, given that the band had two in their live rig that year.', "By their third album, BGM, YMO were firmly way out ahead of everyone else, at least in terms of access to the latest musical technology. The album was recorded on a then-brand-new digital 3M 32-track recorder (which Hosono hated for its brittle sound). The album also featured one of the first recordings of a Roland TR-808. The band had debuted a prototype version of the famous drum machine live in Japan in 1980, thanks no doubt to Matsutake's close association with Roland founder Ikutaro Kakehashi.", 'Their venerable MC-8 was replaced by a new Roland MC-4, which Hosono found much easier to program, often doing it himself live with a Prophet-5. While by all accounts more user-friendly than its predecessor, the MC-4, released in 1981, was still rather cryptic compared to modern sequencers (Aphex Twin apparently likened it to "making tracks on a taxi meter"). It also wasn\'t as robust as the MC-8, with only four sets of CV/gate outputs.', "On the back cover of the original vinyl release of BGM, the band printed a huge grocery list of gear, including synthesizers, effects, and even keyboard stands. While often erroneously assumed to be the studio bill for BGM, this is in fact the customs declaration for their second world tour. While much is the same as the kit list for the Greek Theater show, it does have a few notable additions, including more Prophet-5s, a Roland Jupiter-4, and Matsutake's new E-Mu Modular System.", '"I purchased an E-Mu Modular System in the autumn of 1980 before the start of the second YMO World Tour," he told Stereoklang. "It was because I needed a new quality of sound that was different from the Moog III. Compared with the thick, soft sounds of the Moog III, the E-Mu Modular System has a distinctive solid and metallic sound. It produced a very good contrast when used together with the Moog III… The design was also futuristic and sophisticated, making me feel excited just by looking at it."', 'Live, it was used in the intro to Sakamoto\'s solo cut, "Riot In Lagos," which entered the YMO concert repertoire around that time. It can also be heard on Matsutake\'s second solo album under the name Logic titled Venus (1981).', 'While sampling was starting to catch on in the West, thanks to the Fairlight CMI, there was no Japanese equivalent for YMO to experiment with. Yet.', "Thanks to their inside connections, the band was able to get ahold of the Toshiba LMD-649, a prototype sampler and reportedly the first 12-bit PCM drum machine/sampler. It's all over Technodelic, the band's follow-up to BGM.

Maybe something specific—like, say, Elvis Costello’s walnut-stained Jazzmaster—is your white whale. Perhaps you’re not so picky and would be happy to own anything played (or even touched) by Prince.', 'Unfortunately, many of us may never have the opportunity to own the gear played by our biggest influences. But a lot of rockstars have. Here are a few examples of times musicians bought gear that once belonged to the heroes who shaped them.', 'Rock and folk icon Neil Young may be best known for his ‘53 Les Paul, but another famous guitar in his collection is a 1941 Martin D-28 that was previously owned by the legendary country singer and songwriter Hank Williams.', 'Of course, Neil didn’t purchase the guitar directly from Williams, who died in 1953 when Young was just eight years old. Instead, he purchased it from friend-of-a-friend Tut Taylor.', 'He’s even loaned it out to other famous friends from time-to-time. Most notably, he loaned it to Bob Dylan when Dylan was also borrowing Young’s tour bus.', "It's worth noting that there is some speculation that Young got taken on his purchase, since Williams played a 1944 D-28 that is on display at the Country Music Hall of Fame. However, there's no reason to believe Williams ever owned just one, and his son, Hank Williams Jr, has reportedly verified that Young's was one of his father's.", 'Session musician Waddell "Waddy" Wachtel is best known for his work with Linda Ronstadt, Stevie Nicks, The Rolling Stones, Jackson Browne, and more. He even had a signature guitar released for the Collector’s Choice series from Gibson.', 'The special signature was modeled after his beloved 1960 Les Paul that he purchased for $350 from one of his musical heroes—Stephen Stills.', 'One of the greatest guitar-related headlines of all time might be Guitar World’s “Kirk Hammett: ‘Jimmy Page Told Me to Buy Peter Green’s Les Paul.’”', "This Burst has changed hands often throughout its life. It was famously owned and played by Gary Moore after Green, as well as several collectors before Hammett. (One of those collectors, Melvyn Franks, was the owner when Gibson created the Collector's Choice #1 Reissue of the guitar.) But when it was Hammett's time, rather than pursuing this particular 1959 Les Paul Standard like Hammett normally does with gear, the dealer called him.", 'Hammett of course knew the guitar and its story, and he also knew the hefty price tag. Though he was interested, he wasn’t sure about making the purchase. So he messaged friend and guitar god Jimmy Page to ask him what he thought. Page’s reaction? “Buy it.” The rest is history.', 'Another case of the guitar finding the rockstar is Dan Auerbach and Mississippi Fred McDowell’s Gibson Trini Lopez.', 'Mississippi Fred McDowell was an early blues guitar legend and was renowned for his slide playing. One of his beloved guitars was a Gibson Trini Lopez, which has found its way into the possession of modern blues rocker and enormous McDowell fan Dan Auerbach from The Black Keys.', 'Auerbach was contacted by a person in St. Louis who’d gotten hold of the guitar that he’d seen so many times in classic Alan Lomax VHS tapes. “It was crazy,” he told Vintage Guitar, “I used to stare at it in those videos. I never forgot the little jewels glued to the headstock and upper bout. It was just wild, you know?” After some negotiations (and apparently a terrible poker face on Auerbach’s part), the guitar became part of his permanent collection.', 'It might not seem groundbreaking to hear that French indie band Phoenix recorded their 2013 album Bankrupt! on a Harrison 4032 solid-state recording console. But you’d probably change your mind when you learned the console was the same one used on the best-selling album of all time—Michael Jackson’s Thriller—as well as dozens more from artists like Donna Summer, Billy Idol, and Paul McCartney.', 'Apparently Phoenix guitarist Laurent Brancowitz saw the console listed for sale on eBay of all places. According to The New Yorker, the band “liked the idea of working with a consecrated artifact, as well as having something strange upon which to fixate between albums.” Phoenix talked “spooky” and “pushy” seller Clayton Rose down from his $32,000 asking price (the original asking price was one million dollars just after Jackson’s death) to $17,000 and had him ship it to Paris for the Bankrupt! recording sessions.', 'One of the more recently acquired guitars on this list started with Ed King of seminal Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd. King, who passed away in August 2018, infamously played on songs like “Sweet Home Alabama” and “Saturday Night Special.”', 'After he died, part of his collection landed at Carter Vintage Guitars in Nashville, Tennessee. According to Guitar Player, co-owner Christie Carter asked Jason Isbell to come by and play some of King’s guitars for the shop’s YouTube channel. Isbell saw the fabled ‘59 Les Paul (nicknamed Red Eye), which had famously been stolen in 1987 and recovered a decade later. By the time Isbell left the shop, he had Ed King’s Les Paul with him.', 'Bush singer and ‘90s rock god Gavin Rossdale’s New York Magazine feature “What Musician Gavin Rossdale Can’t Live Without” is mostly full of toiletries and kitchen gadgets, but the guitar he acquired after he inked his first record deal—a purple 1960s Fender Jazzmaster—managed to make this exclusive list. “When I bought it, they told me it had been Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh’s guitar,” he told New York Magazine.', 'Years later, Rossdale met Walsh and asked him to confirm what he thought might have been a tall tale. Instead, Walsh said that not only had the guitar previously been his, but that it had been used to lay down the rhythm guitar parts with it to The Eagles’ most recognizable song, “Hotel California."', 'B-benders, a contraption installed in a guitar to help six-string players emulate pedal steel sounds, are already a rarity. But Byrds and Gram Parsons guitarist, the late Clarence White, was the first to employ this unique technology, created for him by drummer Gene Parsons.', 'Though Clarence tragically died in 1973, when then-child prodigy Marty Stewart was just 15 years old, Stuart had the pleasure of meeting Clarence once before then, through his brother and bandmate Roland White.', 'Stuart considered the White family to be like family—after all, Roland had gotten Stuart his first job with Lester Flatt when Stuart was only 13. So when Clarence White’s widow, Susie, was selling some of her late husband’s things, she offered the famous b-bender Telecaster to Stuart.', 'That’s not all Stuart, who was initially just interested in a Stratocaster, walked away with. For under $1,450, Stuart obtained the B-bender Telecaster, the Stratocaster, Byrds memorabilia, and some Nudie suits.', 'Most of the guitars featured in this article are of guitarists buying gear once played by their heroes. In this case, the guitar was sold to the guitar hero. “You know, I sold Jeff Beck the second Les Paul he ever owned,” Nielsen told MusicRadar. “It was a ’59 that had a Bigsby on it… If you look close, you can see where it used to be. I traded a Gibson SG and $25 for it. I have pictures of me with him, Buddy Guy and Stevie Ray Vaughan 10 years after selling him that guitar.”', 'Joe Bonamassa is one of the world’s foremost guitarists and collectors, so it should be no surprise he’s purchased some historically significant gear. One of those is a gold Fender Stratocaster previously owned by Eldon Shamblin, most known for his work with Bob Wills. In 2016, Bonamassa told Tulsa World that the Shamblin Stratocaster is in the top five off his 260-plus guitar collection.', 'Wilco’s Nels Cline is known for Jazzmasters, but his first bass was purchased from American hardcore legend Mike Watt, bassist for Minutemen, Dos, and fIREHOSE. "I\'ve broken virtually everything on it at some point except for the knobs and the pickups," Cline told Spin Magazine in 2011. The ‘59 Jazzmaster is one of Cline’s most prized guitars and boasts an enviable relic.', 'Original Elvis Presley bassist Bill Black had a short but substantial legacy. He was with Presley since the beginning of Elvis’ career and performed with his own group, The Bill Black Combo. Other than performing with Elvis, The Bill Black Combo were asked by The Beatles themselves to open for the Fab Four on their first-ever tour of the United States following their historic Ed Sullivan performance.', 'It’s fitting then that Paul McCartney would later own Black’s main upright bass. In the late 1970s, Paul’s wife Linda gave the ex-Beatle the bass as a birthday gift. McCartney has put the bass to good use over the years, even performing with it on television specials.', "Despite its serial number, David Gilmour's 0001 Stratocaster isn’t the first-ever Stratocaster made. Still, it’s an obviously special build with a unique color and gold hardware that was likely a showpiece.", 'While David Gilmour is now a Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, it was previously owned by legendary guitarist and master pickup builder Seymour W. Duncan. Duncan had allegedly acquired the one-of-a-kind Stratocaster directly from Leo Fender, and had sold it to Gilmour’s guitar tech Phil Taylor, who then sold it to Gilmour as part of a deal for a home loan.', "In 2019, Gilmour sold the Strat along with more than 120 instruments through Christie's to raise money for charity. The 0001 Strat was sold for $1,815,000 alone, while the full collection sold for $21.5 million.", "Despite such prices for the likes of Gilmour and Christie's, owning a piece of your hero’s gear isn’t as unattainable as you might think. Reverb often hosts Artist Shops—for everyone from J Mascis and Derrick Carter to Dweezil Zappa and Green Day—where everything from iconic guitars to mics and heavily used touring gear goes up for sale.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/shop/marks-gear-bazaar-937'], ['Japan is famous the world over for its musical instruments and hardware. Roland, Korg, and Yamaha are some of the most respected musical instrument manufacturers in the world, with products that are well built and—more often than not—pretty good value for the money. With all three manufacturers cranking out top-quality products, you might be surprised to learn that Japan has an entirely separate domestic market of instruments and hardware that was never intended for export. And, unlike other domestic markets like that of the former Soviet Union, the rest of the world has yet to tap fully into the local Japanese market.', "Japan is a unique place. Although it has a relatively small landmass, the country has a rather large population. At roughly 127 million, it's the 11th largest in the world. It's also a wealthy nation, with the world's third largest economy. Add these to a love for music and a passionate hobby culture and you end up with a large consumer base with money to spend on musical instruments and gear. With import prices being high (Japan is an island nation on the other side of the world from America and Europe), it makes sense that domestic companies would step in to satiate the needs of music-loving Japanese. This was particularly true of the era from the 1960s to the end of the 1980s, when Japan experienced huge economic growth coupled with an increase in the number of young people.", "A surprising aspect of Japanese domestic music gear is the tendency for the company names to not sound Japanese. With names like Elk, Hawk, Evans, and Vesta Fire, you'd be forgiven for thinking they were American or European companies. This was likely the point, at least as far as it concerned Japanese consumers. With most popular music coming from overseas and anything foreign being cool, it's no surprise that local companies went out of their way to sound exotic.", "Since audio gear from this time period is plentiful in Japan, why hasn't it caught on in the West like other gear? There are a few factors at play here. Shipping from Japan is expensive, for one. There's also the language barrier. Unlike Europe, Japanese people tend to not speak English and so prefer to sell domestically. This has kept the lid on Japanese domestic gear, but with so much amazing stuff out there, it's time to shine a light on the world of Japanese domestic gear.", "For those who do make the plunge and buy from Japan, you're likely to find gear that is in excellent condition, even 40 or 50 years after manufacture. These machines were also exceedingly well made, and while anything this old may require occasional maintenance, they are usually still in good working order.", "Let's look at some of the highlights of gear available from Japan. Many of the pieces mentioned here are available through the shop Vintage Audio Nagoya. Stick around for an interview with the shop as well.", "Most everyone is familiar with Roland's line of Space Echo tape echo units. While they are undeniably incredible, they're only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Japanese echo machines. It's almost as if there was an overwhelming need for vocal echo machines. Well, actually, there was.", 'The 1970s was the start of the karaoke boom in Japan and you just had to have an echo unit as part of your karaoke rig at the time. This included Space Echo–style tape units as well as cheaper 8-track cassette units for the less successful watering holes. As a result of all this inebriated singing, there are plenty of unique tape echoes around.', 'There were plenty of effects made for the Japanese domestic market in the 1970s and 1980s, both stomp boxes and tabletop units. They run the gamut from distortion and chorus to bucket brigade analog delay. Here are some examples.', "Producers and musicians are starting to catch on to the power of 1970s mixers for adding warmth and character. They're great for dirtying up a signal or summing mix buses or entire mixes through. Vintage Yamaha EM series mixers are pretty incredible, and the Boss KM-60 is also worth a look.

Though it was with a bass and on a country record, the sound nevertheless came roaring through radios in the form of The Rolling Stones\' "Satisfaction" soon enough, remaking rock guitar in the process.', "Except, how did the fuzz effect become standardized? How did a recording console's defective circuitry come to be replicated, made controllable, and packaged into a convenient pedal? That's where Nancy Sinatra comes in.", 'After Robbins\' "Don\'t Worry" became a hit, "People were calling in to find out what it was," Snoddy told NAMM in 2014. "They couldn\'t understand what this sound was."', "The novelty spread through Nashville, with everyone wanting a bit of the console's fuzz on their own records. But it wasn't until that well ran dry that the fuzz found its footing.", "At the time, effects units took many forms. One of the earliest boxes was DeArmond's Tremolo Control, available around 1941, but the box was not for stomping. More like a small metal lunch pail, the Tremolo Control was a desktop unit, complete with a handle on top.", "Reverb units like Fender's original Reverb Tank housed its electro-mechanical springs and pickup in an amp-like cabinet. No standalone distortion or overdrive effect had yet been invented—with guitarists merely cranking amps or taking matters into their own hands to slice speaker cones for dirtier sounds.", "Because Snoddy's original fuzz tone was a byproduct of bad electronics, there was always an expiration date. One day, the Quonset Hut mixer's faulty circuitry finally gave way for good.", '"We had an artist, Nancy Sinatra, that called and wanted to come in and make a record. When she got there, we had to tell her that the console that was causing that sound, the amplifier had quit, and we couldn\'t do it anymore. They didn\'t like that at all. [Laughs.] I told [Quonset Hut owner and producer] Harold Bradley that I\'d have to see if I could make one and get it going."', 'So it was because of Sinatra—the pop scion whose "These Boots Were Made Walkin\'" was released in 1965—that Snoddy called Revis Hobbs, intent on achieving the console\'s sound, which had been the result of a transformer, through transistors instead.', 'Snoddy and Hobbs placed the circuitry in a wedge-shaped pedal, encapsulating the fuzz tone in what was now officially the Fuzz-Tone, sold under Gibson\'s Maestro brand, first as the FZ-1 and then as the FZ-1A. While others worked in parallel to create a similar effect—Orville Rhodes\' handmade fuzzbox propelled the guitar of The Ventures\' "2000 Pound Bee"—it was the Maestro Fuzz-Tone that Keith Richards managed to get his hands on.', '"Satisfaction," became, well, "Satisfaction." The fever for fuzz pedals was well and truly lit. And who knows if any of it would\'ve happened, or happened the same way, if Nancy Sinatra hadn\'t simply asked.', "This story is told in Reverb's The Pedal Movie, our documentary film that covers the past, present, and future of effects.

On his lap sat an iridescent Gibson ES-150 guitar, its black pickup a scar across its midsection, a twisted cord dangling impertinently from its lower bout. The boxy Gibson EH-150 amplifier next to his chair emitted a low unsettling hum.', "The bandleader had met the guitarist, a 23-year-old named Charlie Christian, earlier in the day when Goodman's brother-in-law, the impresario John Hammond, brought the youngster over to Columbia Studios in Hollywood. Benny had been unimpressed then, and he now realized that Hammond had set the kid up on stage during the break to force an audition.", "With the 10:00 pm set about to begin and the house packed with eager swing fans, Goodman had no choice but to allow the garishly clad guitarist to sit in. He promptly called for 'Rose Room,' a tune of 1917 vintage that he was sure the Midwesterner wouldn't know. After three fleet choruses, Benny passed the lead over to Christian.", 'Turning up the gain on his electric Gibson, Christian improvised his way through a first chorus with stunning ease, demonstrating that he not only knew the tune but knew it well. His amplified sound had an uncanny horn-like timbre, and his phrases cut through the din of the rhythm section like a knife through butter. He took another chorus, building on the first, and then another. After 20 more, he brought his solo to a triumphant conclusion, electrifying the room with his electric guitar.', "The audience, stunned, rewarded him with uproarious applause, and immediately following the set on that August evening in 1939, a chastened Benny Goodman hired Charlie Christian to complete the bandleader's newly formed sextet.", "It was the guitarist's big break, and after years of touring in near anonymity with territory bands, he would soon be known nationally and internationally as a pioneer of the electric guitar, and one of jazz's greatest soloists. But while Charlie Christian was one of the first jazz musicians to play an amplified instrument, he wasn't the very first.", "That honor might belong to Eddie Durham. Like Christian, Durham was born in Texas, and he had made his way to Kansas City, Missouri, after playing in his family's band and in various circus orchestras and minstrel show outfits. In KayCee, he joined Bennie Moten's dance orchestra, doubling on trombone and guitar. On the former instrument he had no trouble being heard, but the 11-piece band often drowned whatever sounds he could produce on guitar. He quickly realized he needed some way to increase the instrument's volume.", 'Using a National resonator guitar, Durham found that by holding its metal diaphragm up to a microphone, he could amplify the instrument enough so that he could be heard over the band. But it was awkward having to jump up and come down to the PA mic at the front of the stage whenever it was time for a solo. So he soon rigged up his own mic and a small amp made from an old radio, which meant he could solo right from his seat.', 'By 1935, Durham was using a commercially-made pickup, a DeArmond bar-style "guitar microphone," clamped to an acoustic guitar. "I made an attachment where I could play into the sound system," Durham told Douglas Henry Daniels in the book One O\'clock Jump. Durham was using that rig with the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra when he encountered Charlie Christian in Oklahoma City in 1937.', 'He recalled that Christian wasn\'t playing guitar. The younger musician was playing piano, but when he heard what Eddie was doing, Christian decided to switch instruments. "He had big eyes to sound like a saxophone," Eddie continued, and he showed the Oklahoman a few tricks for getting a horn-like sound out of an electric instrument. "Man, I never saw a fellow learn so fast, nor have I ever seen anyone rise to the top so quickly," Durham said. "The next thing I knew, Christian was a star with the Benny Goodman band!"', 'Before Charlie Christian hooked up with the King of Swing in Beverly Hills, though, he spent time on the road with the Alphonse Trent Orchestra, a small group based out of Kansas City. While Trent was performing in Bismarck, North Dakota, a young woman came to see the band, having heard about the guitarist who was amazing audiences with his amplified sound.', "Seventeen-year-old Mary Osborne thought she was hearing a tenor saxophone soloing when she first entered the club, but then realized that the sound was coming from Christian's plugged-in Gibson.", '"I remember hearing some of the figures Charlie played in his solos," Osborne told Al Avakian and Bob Prince for their liner notes to the 1955 album Charlie Christian With The Benny Goodman Sextet and Orchestra. "They were exactly the same things that Benny recorded later as \'Flying Home,\' \'Gone With "What" Wind,\' \'Seven Come Eleven,\' and all the others."', 'Osborne was so inspired by Christian\'s playing that she sought him out after the gig, and they briefly jammed together while Christian offered her tips on technique and shared musical ideas. He also told her where in town she could find a Gibson ES-150 and amp like his, and when Osborne visited the store a few days later, she found the guitar displayed in the window with a sign that read "As played by Charlie Christian, featured in the Al Trent Sextet."', 'Osborne was soon good enough on electric guitar that she joined pianist Winifred McDonnell\'s trio and toured extensively in North Dakota and Minnesota before heading east to Philadelphia and eventually New York City. It was there in 1941 that she gigged at Minton\'s Playhouse on 118th Street in Harlem, meeting and playing with the jazz greats Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster, and Art Tatum and jamming with the bop pioneer Dizzy Gillespie. Later, she recorded with all four, inspiring critic Leonard Feather to call her a pioneer of modern jazz guitar and describing her as having an "exceptional beat" and an "aggressively swinging style."', "Of all the great electric guitarists to come out of the jazz crucible of the American Midwest in the '30s, Floyd Smith is perhaps the least well known. Born in St. Louis in 1917, Smith received his first musical instruction on ukulele but then switched to banjo, joining the Jeter-Pillars Orchestra in his late teens and playing with that band for several years.", "By the mid-'30s, Smith was playing guitar, using an acoustic D'Angelico Excel for rhythm and soloing on a Vega electric. In 1939, when he joined Andy Kirk's famed Kansas City swing band, the Twelve Clouds Of Joy, he added another electric instrument to his arsenal—a Gibson EH-150 lap-steel guitar.", 'Though lap-steels had been used in Texas swing-style country music since the mid-\'30s, Smith was the first to adapt the instrument to the jazz idiom. Not everyone was a fan of the steel\'s fluid, slurry sound—John Hammond called it "ghastly"—but Floyd used it to good effect on more than a few Kirk selections, scoring a national hit for Kirk\'s Clouds Of Joy with \'Floyd\'s Guitar Blues,\' recorded shortly after he joined the band.', "Following his departure from the Clouds in the mid '40s, Smith worked with Coleman Hawkins, Horace Henderson, Illinois Jacquet, and many others, primarily on steel. In later years, though, he set aside his EH-150 and performed with the jazz organist Wild Bill Davis using a National Glenwood electric.", "Electricity inevitably elevated the humble guitar to a position of prominence in jazz. It was Eddie Durham who first pioneered its transition to an electric instrument, thus enabling big-band players to solo audibly, and it was Floyd Smith who demonstrated the lap-steel's jazz capabilities. Charlie Christian and his disciple Mary Osborne went on to show that it was possible to improvise on an electric guitar with a virtuosity rivaling that of the best jazz horn soloists.", "Today, jazz guitarists invariably plug in, using archtop and solidbody instruments played through a variety of amplifiers and effects to continue to expand the music's possibilities. Those possibilities, however, got their start in Kansas City nearly 90 years ago.", "About the author: David Dann is a music historian, writer, and amateur musician who is the author of Guitar King: Michael Bloomfield's Life In The Blues. For three decades, he was host of Crosscurrents, a jazz-and-blues radio program heard over WJFF in New York.

When talented artists lay down tracks in treated rooms, record into high-end consoles, sing through tube mics with perfect placement—that's a recipe for sonic perfection.", 'But not every great record needs such white-glove service. And in fact, you may be surprised to learn just how many incredible albums have been made with standard-issue mics.', 'In our list below, we are merely scratching the surface. And a few caveats are in order:', "Countless records use at least one inexpensive mic—on a snare drum, a guitar cab, or some other single instrument. But that's not where our focus lies today. Instead, we're talking about those records which primarily used cheap mics, or whose main vocal performances were captured by them.", 'There are times when an artist, producer, or engineer could be downplaying the equipment they actually had on hand, instead of fessing up to using really nice gear. That said, all of our records below have some documentation or on-the-record interviews that the players involved were using inexpensive microphones during the recording sessions.', "Even performances that were recorded with a cheap mic can of course be mixed and mastered with premium equipment. But this shouldn't stop you from using whatever you have on hand. If recording a project, you can always send out your tracks for mixing and mastering. And if you want to do it all yourself, modern plugins and 500 series rack gear all provide alternatives to professional studios.", "So, with those caveats behind us, here's a list that we hope gets a conversation started. What other great records were made with cheap mics?", 'The soaring choruses of "More Than a Feeling" dominated AM radio upon its 1976 release and have been a staple on "classic rock" radio since the beginning of the format. So it might not be the first thing you think of when you imagine DIY music.', "But the majority of that song—and Boston's self-titled debut album—was recorded in producer/multi-instrumentalist Tom Scholz's Watertown, Massachusetts basement, mostly with Shure SM57s.", "Outside of Brad Delp's lead vocals—which, according to a 2000 Mix article, were recorded in LA as part of a ruse to allow the Scholz to continue to work out of his basement—the whole song was a home-studio production.", 'Like Prince—who was known for cutting his own vocals while seated at the recording console—Solange Knowles has found that singing along to monitors allows her to get in the zone and capture a more emotive performance.', 'While Prince used everything from an SM57 to a AKG C12 or Neumann U 47, Solange has gravitated toward one mic in particular: the Shure Beta 58A.', 'In an interview with her go-to recording engineer Mikaelin "Blue" Bluespruce, he told Reverb:', '"The Shure Beta 58 is the main thing that has to be there in terms of recording. She really doesn\'t like to be standing in front of a mic. … She likes to be seated, walking around the room, or however she wants to be she wants to bring the mic with her and hold it in her hand. The Beta 58 is the only thing that has to be there."', "When you think of affordable gear, a $1,000 mic might not be your first thought, but when talking about Neumann, affordability is relative. The TLM 103, one of the company's least expensive mics, is a popular choice for young producers and engineers looking to level-up their setup with their first condenser.", 'Back in 2008, one such upcoming producer was Drake\'s right-hand man, Noah "40" Shebib. In apartments and hotel rooms, they created the tracks that would become So Far Gone, Drake\'s breakout mixtape, working off a Pro Tools-equipped laptop, some MBox interfaces, and a TLM 103. Singles like "Best I Ever Had" and "Successful" became enormous hits and launched the pop mainstay\'s career.', "In a 2014 blog post on their label's website, 40 looked back at the time:", '"I look at any old laptops or M-Box\'s like gold and that\'s where it starts. The hungry kids with what they can get their hands on making it not just work, but work at a professional level. … Now this may not be anything overwhelming in 2014. But in 2009 to be nominated for a Grammy and have multiple # 1\'s, it was still fairly astonishing that it wasn\'t an SSL 4K or a 1073 with a C800. It was a Neumann TLM 103, an amazing reasonably priced mic that gets the job done, a laptop and an M-Box. That\'s it."', 'Around that time, Vampire Weekend\'s Rostam Batmanglij was also getting the most out of a laptop recording rig. The group\'s debut album—which included hits like "A-Punk" and "Oxford Comma"—was recorded at several locations in and around New York City, including apartments and basements.', 'Rostam has since become one of the most successful pop and indie pop producers around, but back then he was still one of us, posting on gear forums about the equipment he used.', 'In a series of posts on Gearspace, he explained the various gear used on the record, which included little more than a Digidesign Digi 002 interface and plugins of the era like Altiverb, Vintage Warmer, and a "Vintage Spring Reverb" IR.', 'All of the mics were affordable. They used a TLM 103 for most of the vocals and, for tracks like "Oxford Comma," a single Sennheiser 421 for the drums: "most of the drum sound came from one mic … the room was carpeted and about 12\' X 12\', it was a practice room," he wrote.', "Like Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska, the lore around the recording of Bon Iver's debut is deeply connected to the record itself. The Boss' was a left-hand turn away from his stardom, a testament to deft songcraft and stark lyrical themes, recorded with two SM57s into a four-track cassette recorder. The more it sounded like a demo, the better.", 'For Emma, Forever Ago, on the other hand, became a breakout release for a rising producer-songwriter, who was trying to make a record that sounded as clean as he possibly could, with a single SM57 and an overloaded laptop.', 'In 2008, he explained his philosophy to Stereogum: "I just set up a few mics that I know sound good, like ribbons, and use common sense. If an $80 mic sounds better for what you are doing than the $1,100 mic does, it’s a no-brainer. Get pres that sound good to you, not to the forum junkies. That’s my philosophy. Try stuff out; that’s what I do."', 'His setup has definitely grown over the years to match his expanded musical palette—and you can see his gear-packed April Base studio in this 2014 video—but presumably the wall of Pultec, Teletronix, and other classic outboard gear does sound good to him.', "Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell, her brother, producer, and co-songwriter, are the reigning champions of home recording, creating an incredibly successful, multi-Grammy-Award-winning album in Finneas' bedroom.", "If you'll remember one of our caveats from above—that DIY tracks can be sent to pros for mixing and mastering—that did happen here, which has led to fairly wide speculation on gear forums if the record deserves its home-recorded status.", "But the fact of the matter is the tracks were created on what is now a standard modern computer rig, in the duo's childhood home. Finneas told Sound on Sound in 2019 that the setup included: Apple's Logic DAW, a MIDI controller to play a wide collection of software synths and samples, a Universal Audio Apollo interface, Yamaha monitors, and a Neumann TLM 103 for Eilish's vocals (which you can see in many scenes of the 2021 documentary about the making of the album, The World's a Little Blurry).", 'Going back a bit further to her breakout single, "Ocean Eyes," and the pair didn\'t even have the Neumann. For that song, Eilish sang into an Audio-Technica AT2020. In SOS Finneas says, "Billie\'s vocals for \'Ocean Eyes\' were recorded with the 2020, which sounds great.

But there was so much more to her career than that. Over an extraordinarily productive decade or so from the early '60s, she produced a huge volume of music at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. And that's not all.", "During those years, she and her Workshop colleague Brian Hodgson formed Unit Delta Plus with Peter Zinovieff, the founder of EMS, to create and promote electronic music. A little later there was the Kaleidophon studio, built in Camden, north London by Derbyshire, Hodgson, and David Vorhaus. And there were multiple one-off projects, collaborations, and commissions. The 267 reel-to-reel tapes found in her attic after her death contained music for stage, screens big and small, radio, '60s happenings, and art installations. Here we have space to explore just a tiny fragment of Derbyshire's work beyond Doctor Who.", 'Delia Derbyshire was born in Coventry, England in 1937. Academically and musically gifted, she won a scholarship to study maths at Cambridge, but after one year she switched to music. She graduated in 1959 and then spent a peripatetic year, mainly teaching and working in music publishing.', "In November 1960, she joined the BBC as a trainee assistant studio manager, and in April '62, she was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop, where our story begins. Brian Hodgson, who would become a close friend, joined the same year, followed by John Baker in 1963. These three were at the heart of a golden age of electronic music experimentation at the BBC.", 'From the late \'40s, two distinct schools of thought about electronic music emerged in Europe—musique concrète, from Paris, and elektronische musik, from Cologne. Musique concrète used manipulated recordings of "real" sound as its raw material, whereas elektronische musik chose electronically generated and filtered sine waves. The pioneer British electronic composers tended to avoid what often became a pedantic, doctrinaire distinction. This was the world that Derbyshire entered, and she demonstrated an unusual facility for combining both approaches.', 'In 1963, she created her arrangement of the Doctor Who theme, assisted by Dick Mills. At the time, it was just one in a steady stream of internal commissions that came her way for BBC television and radio. They required her to perform frequent leaps of creative imagination, from cerebral cultural experiments to lightweight novelty fragments and all points between.', "In 1964, she commenced work on four Inventions For Radio, created with the actor and dramatist Barry Bermange. These combined Derbyshire's electronic music with collages of interviews with members of the public discussing the dream state, the existence of God, the afterlife, and old age.", 'That same year there was Know Your Car, a musique concrète arrangement of Billy Murray\'s 1914 hit "He\'d Have To Get Under—Get Out And Get Under (To Fix Up His Automobile)." Speaking of this in The BBC Radiophonic Workshop: The First 25 Years (1983) by Desmond Briscoe and Roy Curtis-Bramwell, Derbyshire said: "I always immensely enjoyed doing funny programmes … I made it on simulated car horns and cut it together very carefully … [and] it was turned down because one particular car had been used for the series and the manufacturers didn\'t really want my efforts to be associated with their product."', "That rejection of a composition is an example of a tendency that eventually drove Derbyshire away from the BBC. In August 1965, while working on the final Invention, she was also composing for the children's educational programmes Primary School Mathematics Programme 2 (TV) and A Game of Chess (a dance drama for schools radio).", "The following year, the extra-curricular activity began in earnest. Derbyshire, Hodgson, and Zinovieff founded Unit Delta Plus. Neither a band nor an organization, but something in between, it operated out of Zinovieff's home studio in Putney, south London. The idea was both to create and promote electronic music.", "Zinovieff's studio was lavishly equipped. Independently wealthy, he had built a semi-subterranean base in his garden, which ran down to the River Thames. It housed his Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-8 computer that cost about £4,000—more than the average house price at the time.", "Unit Delta Plus embodied a culture clash, which explains why the project lasted little more than a year. Zinovieff was an innovative theorist, dismissive of tape techniques in electronic music and envisioning a world where computers told sound generators what to play. Derbyshire and Hodgson, meanwhile, came from a world of short-notice commissions, laborious tape splicing, and making it up as you went along. Zinovieff in particular would later dismiss the trio's musical output. Even so, they played a central role in two intriguing cultural moments.", 'On September 10, 1966, at the Watermill Theatre near Newbury in southern England, Unit Delta Plus hosted a concert of electronic music. It was the first ever in the UK, depending on how you define a concert. It featured seven pieces composed and realized by several combinations of the three members, along with light projections.', 'Derbyshire created or co-created four of these, including a 15-minute section of "Amor Dei," one of the Radio Inventions. Another was "Moogies Bloogies," which the programme notes called an "electronic pop song" for the singer and actor Anthony Newley. The notes went on to explain that the song contained traditional musical elements—melody, harmony, and rhythm—but that it was built up entirely of sine waves. The apparent reference to Moog in the title is probably coincidental. Newley pronounces the word as "mooj." Playful and odd, it was a one-off, a glimpse of an alternative future never explored. Derbyshire and Newley did not work together again.', "Another event, the 1967 Million Volt Light–Sound Rave at London's Roundhouse in north-west London featured a more famous one-off. The Rave took place over two nights (January 28 and February 4) and included tape music by Unit Delta Plus and the sole playback of Carnival of Light, Paul McCartney's 14-minute sound collage.", "The previous year, McCartney had visited Unit Delta Plus at the Putney studio. Decades later, he recalled this as a visit to the Radiophonic Workshop, saying he'd found Derbyshire's phone number and called her cold to arrange the visit. But a reference to going to a hut in the garden places him in Putney, which Derbyshire, Hodgson, and Zinovieff later confirmed.", 'Nothing much came of this meeting, apart from a tantalizing but unsubstantiated rumor that McCartney wanted Derbyshire to create an electronic version of "Yesterday." Symbolically, however, it\'s significant in two ways. McCartney, in meeting Unit Delta Plus, was following a trend in rock music—casting around for a new direction, including the exploration of electronic and tape music. And it was Derbyshire he settled on as the person to send him off on this journey, thus underlining her stature in British electronic music in the \'60s.', "The start of Derbyshire and Hodgson's next venture overlapped with the dying days of Unit Delta Plus. The American-born classical bass player David Vorhaus chanced upon a Unit Delta Plus lecture about electronic music. Within a week, he had teamed up with Hodgson and Derbyshire, and the three fashioned two tape compositions with added vocals, which caught the ear of Chris Blackwell at Island Records. He offered them a deal, and an album was pieced together through 1968 at their Kaleidophon studio.", 'The album was released the following year as An Electric Storm, credited to White Noise. With its squalls of electronic sound, mixed male and female harmony vocals, and a jazz drummer (Paul Lytton), all delivering a blend of progressive, folky, psychedelic rock, it sounded like nothing else in the UK.', 'It did, though, sound a little like the United States of America\'s sole album, released in 1968. The resemblance was superficial. Whereas the US band used a one-off electronic instrument as its sound source, White Noise deployed tape editing (and a rumor that the band used a prototype EMS VCS3 synth is incorrect). As Vorhaus explained in an interview for 2019\'s Delia Derbyshire Day, it was Derbyshire who led on the tape work: "… the splicing and things, Delia has this down to a fine art. She\'d chop stuff up really fast."', 'An Electric Storm was melodically rich and had a firm grasp of song craft, but it was just too strange to break through on first release. Over the years it has sold well, however, the fullest ever expression of tape-editing technique on a rock record.', "Derbyshire continued working at the Radiophonic Workshop into the '70s. She left in 1973, frustrated by deadline pressures and the rejection of some of her output. Briefly, she teamed up with Hodgson, who left the Workshop that same year to set up the Electrophon studio. She collaborated with him on the score to the horror movie The Legend of Hell House, but left soon after. From then on, little was heard of her musically, though she occasionally composed for art films.", "By the '90s, a generation of British musicians, writers, and Doctor Who fans—whose childhoods had been soundtracked by Derbyshire's music—began to seek her out. She was interviewed for radio and several fanzines. Pete Kember, a.k.a. Sonic Boom of Spacemen 3, coaxed her into a tentative re-engagement with music. Their Synchrondipity Machine (An Unfinished Dream) was recorded in 2000, using then current computer technology. It sounded oddly similar to the sort of tape and oscillator soundscapes Derbyshire had turned out every week for the BBC, 35 years earlier.", 'Delia Derbyshire died in 2001. Her archive now resides at the University of Manchester in England. The work of researching, cataloguing, and reissuing her extraordinary musical output continues.', 'About the author: Mark Brend is an author and a musician.

In the UK, though, interest was confined to a few questing individuals, including Daphne Oram and Desmond Briscoe, both BBC staff members. Through 1957, while working out-of-hours creating electronic sound for pioneering BBC broadcasts, the pair lobbied the corporation to create its own electronic music studio.", 'When the BBC Radiophonic Workshop opened on April 1, 1958, at the BBC studio in Maida Vale, west London, there was a sense of giving in to tiresome zealots. Dick Mills, the longest-serving member of the Workshop staff, told me about the unspoken but implied BBC attitude, which was: "Why don\'t we give them a room somewhere—and let them get it out of their systems?"', "The Workshop was equipped with tape recorders, turntables, oscillators—the tools of the '50s electronic musician—but in this case secondhand, obsolete, and sometimes broken. The mixer, for example, was a pre-war antique with an oak body and had once been installed in the Royal Albert Hall.", 'From such inauspicious beginnings, the Workshop made a swift impact, and large audiences began hearing radical electronic music. Screenwriter Nigel Kneale made notes for sound design for his BBC television serial Quatermass And The Pit (1958/\'59) such as "electronic vibration with occult noises." Briscoe, assisted by Mills, interpreted these with spliced and reversed recordings of feedback, echoed drums, and disconnecting amplifiers. The final episode was watched by a fifth of the UK\'s population.', 'Oram left within a year, but others soon joined, including Delia Derbyshire and Brian Hodgson. It fell to Derbyshire, assisted by Mills, to realise composer Ron Grainer\'s theme for a new children\'s sci-fi television series. Grainer delivered a single sheet of paper, with a bassline, a melody, and instructions to convey atmosphere, such as "wind bubble" and "cloud."', "From this, Derbyshire, with Mills again, took two weeks in August 1963 to create the most recognisable piece of British electronic music. The Doctor Who theme was first heard on November 21 that year, at 5:15 p.m., and remained in service (with various reboots) until 1980. Hodgson, meanwhile, created the equally famous sound of the TARDIS dematerialization from a recording he'd made by scraping a key down a bass string of a broken piano.", "Through the '60s, electronic music edged away from tape composition toward voltage-controlled synthesis. The Workshop's composers, managed by Briscoe, observed with interest, and in 1969 there was talk of buying a Moog. It came to nothing, due to cost, bureaucracy, and perhaps reticence from Briscoe himself. Instead, the Workshop turned its attention to Electronic Music Studios (EMS).", "Founded in 1969 by Peter Zinovieff, Tristram Cary, and David Cockerell, EMS had ties with the Workshop. In 1966, Zinovieff had formed Unit Delta Plus with a moonlighting Derbyshire and Hodgson. The trio created electronic music in a studio in the garden of Zinovieff's house in Putney, south-west London, which backed onto the River Thames. Cary had been making electronic music years before the Workshop formed and built probably the first electronic music home studio in England. Though never a Workshop member, he often visited, and he worked regularly on Doctor Who.", "Based at Zinovieff's Putney house, EMS produced the joystick-controlled VCS3 in 1969, which was priced less than the new Minimoog. The Workshop purchased several VCS3s and later a Synthi 100, a huge modular system known as the Delaware, and the new technology contributed to a changing of the guard. Sixties stalwarts Hodgson and Derbyshire were gone within a few years of the synths' arrival. Derbyshire was primarily a tape composer, and she never fully embraced synths. Hodgson did, but he decided—for a while—to explore their potential elsewhere.", "It fell to a new generation, including Paddy Kingsland, Roger Limb, and Peter Howell, to take the synths in hand. The synths were quicker compositional and recording tools than tape, but they had their quirks. So sensitive was the Delaware to temperature that it was prone to going out of tune when the studio door was opened. Even so, it was widely used, including by Kingsland on the (recently reissued) soundtrack to the children's television series The Changes (1975) and for effects on the original radio series of The Hitch-Hikers Guide To The Galaxy (1978).", "Briscoe retired in 1977, replaced as Workshop Organiser by the returning Hodgson. In his five years away, Hodgson had made electronic music commercially, with some success. He found a Workshop that now contained expensive equipment, but it retained a cobbled-together feel. Hodgson knew that synth development was accelerating. The once-futuristic Delaware looked like a dinosaur by the end of the '70s. He methodically retooled the Workshop, and by the mid-'80s he had his composers working in studios with Yamaha DX7s, at least one Fairlight, and Apple Macs.", 'Traditionalists grumbled, but Howell told Sound On Sound in 2008: "There\'s still this prevailing idea that we were somehow almost traitors for using modern gear and computers! Some people still believe that the original Workshop … was the only incarnation that mattered. But … why on earth should I spend three weeks chopping up little bits of tape to get exactly the same result? We had to catch up with the real world."', "A high-profile product from this era was Elizabeth Parker's score for David Attenborough's The Living Planet (1984), which made extensive use of the PPG Wave 2.2.", 'As the cost of electronic music equipment fell in inverse proportion to its availability, a new generation of freelancers set up home studios of a sophistication once unimaginable. Electronic music was no longer the preserve of the big professional studio.', "John Birt, who was appointed as the BBC's director-general in 1992, initiated measures intended to make the corporation run more like a commercial business. Birt's BBC evaluated departments according to their economic efficiency, and the Workshop couldn't compete financially with freelance composers. It could artistically, though, and continued to work on flagship projects such as Michael Palin's Full Circle television series (1997). But its influence was waning. In the Workshop's '70s heyday, there were 300-plus commissions per year. In 1997, there were just eight.", 'Hodgson left in 1995. The following year Mark Ayres, a composer who had worked on Doctor Who in the late \'80s, was summoned. He told me: "There were three rooms of sketchily catalogued tapes, and there was a move to dispose of them. I was called by Peter Howell, Paddy Kingsland, and Brian Hodgson—individually, but in quick succession—asking if I would take on the cataloging and preservation, as they\'d found a friendly ear in BBC Radio Production Resources, Colin Duff."', 'The tapes, catalogued and labeled by Ayres, were moved from Maida Vale to the BBC archive on April 1, 1998, 40 years to the day since the Workshop had first opened. By this time it was history. Ayres said: "At the last, it was just Peter Howell and Elizabeth Parker left, working on Full Circle. Peter had a home studio, and completed his work there, so Liz was the last person at Maida Vale. She was made redundant before the programmes were completed, so she finished the job as a freelance, renting her studio back from the BBC until it was done."', "Almost as soon as it was gone, the Workshop was nostalgically eulogised. Compilations were issued on CD, while magazine articles contributed to developing cults around Derbyshire and Oram in particular. A TV documentary,The Alchemists Of Sound (2003), featured Workshop alumni reminiscing about their glory days. Oliver Postgate, of Bagpuss and Clangers fame, was the narrator, a choice that underlined the programme's positioning of the Workshop as a peculiarly British example of homespun creativity and ingenuity.", 'Fittingly for an institution so connected with Doctor Who, in May 2009 the Workshop reconvened in a new form. Ayres rounded up Limb, Kingsland, Howell, and the venerable Mills for a concert at The Roundhouse in north-west London. Billed as The Radiophonic Workshop, the quintet, backed by a brass section and drummer, performed arrangements of BBC highlights, including Hitch-Hikers and Doctor Who, alongside new compositions.', "This incarnation of the Workshop continues, with live performances and a 2017 album of new material, Burials In Several Earths. And the London Contemporary Orchestra performed a Pioneers Of Sound concert during 2018's Proms at the Albert Hall as a tribute to the Workshop and including works by Oram and Derbyshire.", 'Meanwhile, in a situation mirroring the afterlife of so many heritage rock bands, in 2012 Arts Council England and the BBC launched the New Radiophonic Workshop as an online venture, under composer Matthew Herbert as creative director. Herbert\'s first work took audio from 25 previous Workshop projects to create what he described as a "curious murmur of activity."', 'About the author: Mark Brend is an author and a musician.

It’s George Martin. The two men have worked together a lot, George producing and Mike arranging, but this time it’s a more unusual job. George says The Beatles are thinking about putting some Moog on a few tracks on the band’s new album (the one released a little later as Abbey Road). Would Mike come to the studio and sort out some sounds for them?', 'George knows Mike is one of the few people in Britain who owns one of Moog’s big modular synthesizers—the type sometimes jokingly said to look like an old-fashioned telephone exchange, thanks to its multiple patch-cord connections. George suggests Mike should charge £30 for an afternoon’s work creating synth sounds for the world’s most famous group.', 'Mike’s professional path as a musician had taken a strong turn six years earlier in Manfred Mann, where he mainly played guitar—although he was also proficient on saxophone and flute. Despite the hits, he left late in 1965 after a movie producer heard his solo single, “On The Brink,” and offered him a tempting opportunity to compose a film score. That was exactly the sort of thing he wanted to get into.', '“Maybe I could have done it without leaving the group,” Mike tells me, “but we were working all the time, and I just got very excited about doing a score—and they offered me another one soon afterwards. I never doubted that I’d done the right thing. And a year or so after I’d left, I started getting incredibly busy with arrangements, too.”', 'He became a first-call arranger for British pop records, working regularly alongside producers and A&R men with artists such as Cilla Black, Cliff Richard, and Engelbert Humperdinck. In 1967, he arranged and conducted the orchestra for The Beatles’ performance of “All You Need Is Love” as part of the "Our World" global satellite broadcast.', 'As he worked around the London studios, he heard about “some mad professor called Moog and something called a synthesizer.” Mike already had ideas about using electronic sounds in pop music. He’d built himself an oscillator from a Heathkit and played it experimentally on his 1967 solo single “Captain Scarlet And The Mysterons,” and a little later on a Paul Jones album track, “The Committee.” So, a Moog voltage-controlled synthesizer must have seemed like the next logical step. A big, brave, expensive step.', 'In 1968, the year that Wendy Carlos’s hit album Switched On Bach brought Robert Moog’s creations to popular attention, Mike ordered a Moog IIIc. He borrowed a staggering sum (his recollection is £3,500, around $8,300 USD at the time) to buy the modular synthesizer. As he waited many weeks for his prize to arrive, he kept himself busy reading and re-reading the three paltry pages of Moog information he’d been given.', '“There was a paragraph on each of the various modules—just very little information. But I read this every night in bed, trying to learn what the functions were and everything. And I was startled—What!—when I read that it was monophonic, that you could only play one note at a time. But eventually I understood why that was. I couldn’t wait for it to turn up, actually.”', 'Eventually the packages arrived. His IIIc came in several parts. “There was a keyboard, the Ribbon Controller slider thing, and two wooden cabinets. The main bottom cabinet sloped backwards slightly—you put the keyboard and ribbon in front of it—and then the second cabinet sat on top of the first one.”', 'The IIIc came as standard with at least a VCO, white sound source, fixed filter bank, VCF low-pass, VCF high-pass, filter coupler, reverberation unit, envelope follower, and a four-channel mixer—plus nine oscillators, three oscillator controllers, three VCAs, three envelope generators, and several console panels, along with a large pile of patch cords and switch-trigger cords.', '“Later,” Mike says, “I got a double sequencer unit, which sat on the top of it all and made it quite a tall thing in the end. Anyway, when it first arrived I set it all up, and the first snag was that it was made for American power. So someone had to find me a transformer. Then I plugged it in and started mucking about with it—and that’s basically what I did forever after,” he adds with a laugh. “Muck about with it! It’s such a learning experience. Once I got my brain around it, it was amazing really.”', 'He was in select company. Manchester University may have been the first to own a Moog modular system in the UK. Theirs was shipped in August 1968, just before The Rolling Stones’ order left the Moog factory in Trumansburg, New York. George Harrison’s IIIp was shipped in January 1969, and George almost immediately recorded his Electronic Sounds album with it, assisted by Paul Beaver and Bernie Krause. These two musicians had first alerted American rock players to the possibilities of the Moog when they demonstrated one at the Monterey festival in 1967.', 'Mike Vickers became the main man on the London studio scene who could work and play a Moog, and he developed a useful sideline to his other professional activities by hiring the synth or, more often, himself and the synth. Later, he helped Keith Emerson enter the world of voltage-controlled synthesis, and he used his IIIc for TV and movie work and many solo projects, including library-music recordings such as his KPM albums A Moog For All Reasons (1972) and A Moog For More Reasons (1975).', 'But it was George Harrison’s IIIp that The Beatles had at Abbey Road in August 1969 when Mike arrived. “They were playing ‘Because’ as I walked into the control room,” he recalls, “and it just sounded so utterly beautiful. I couldn’t believe it. They were so calm and relaxed, adding a couple more harmonies down in the studio. Golly! I thought the way they worked was amazing. Nobody seemed to say anything, but it all happened. Extraordinary.”', 'They moved to a small room off of Studio 3 where the Moog was set up. “They told me vaguely what they might want—something tinkly, something like horns, big brass, whatever, and then I’d set it up. Paul played the keyboard, John played the keyboard, George played the keyboard—so I’d set the sounds up and then they’d play their part. They all seemed to know exactly what they wanted to do on the keyboard, so it all went very quickly. It was all done in about three hours.”', 'Mike helped them get the sounds they wanted to add to four songs. For “Because,” he conjured up some brassy sounds and a wobbly melody, and “Maxwell’s Silver Hammer” benefitted from more brassy parts plus some tremulous high stuff and glissy bits. When it came to “I Want You (She’s So Heavy),” Mike showed them how to produce noise from the Moog’s fixed filter bank, and for “Here Comes The Sun” he helped them with the gliss-down at the front and yet more brassy sounds in the “sun sun sun” chorus.', '“It’s hard to remember exactly what I did more than 50 years ago,” Mike says with a smile. “But the brassy stuff would tend to be several oscillators set to sawtooth, through a filter with envelope control for the brassy attack. The high melodic stuff would tend to be a triangular wave, or perhaps a heavily filtered sawtooth, with applied wobbles with vibrato or tremolo from an LFO, maybe.”', 'For “I Want You” and the noise from the synth’s fixed filter bank, Mike recalls feeding in white noise at one end. “Then it had about 16 or more frequency bands, each of which you could turn up however much you wanted, on its own or in combination with others. George Harrison was doing that. I set it up, but he started turning them up and built this increasing white noise all over the place.', '"Rather than play the keyboard, he fiddled about with the filter—he was good at that. It gets a bit unclear and chaotic as it goes on, but that’s how it was done. I used to have a chart which I made and copied many times, on which I marked the patch cords and knob settings for each piece. Life before memory was very tough!”', 'A few days after Abbey Road was released in 1969, Mike appeared on a BBC TV popular science show, "Tomorrow’s World," with his IIIc and a four-track tape machine. The clip opened with him playing over his multi-tracked rendition of “Greensleeves.” The voiceover told viewers that all the electronic sounds they heard were made by this one man, Michael Vickers, on a single musical instrument.', '“It’s called the Moog synthesizer. It produces sounds in a matter of minutes which would normally take radiophonic experts with their complicated equipment days of work and multiple re-recordings to achieve.” In the few minutes available, the piece did a reasonable job of explaining the basics of the new-fangled device.', '“To be honest with you, it was very boring to me how they wanted to do it,” Mike recalls of the TV experience. “I was still full of Switched On Bach, but today the idea of using a brand-new instrument to do old music, like ‘Greensleeves’—well, it seems silly to me now. I could have done something spacey and noisy, which was much more what I was interested in.', '"Once I had my Moog, I just learned to pile things in and try things out. Rather than trying to sort of pre-determine the sound in my head, I’d very often just see what happened. That suited me much better. I guess I was in some sort of a Moog haze, starry-eyed and voltage-controlled.”', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

We all know there are some fantastic companies out there creating stunning sample libraries, but they can be quite expensive. With months of uncertainty ahead, when could be a better time to create your own unique samples?', 'Creating your own samples is a very rewarding experience. It can be done on a shoestring budget with the most basic of equipment.', 'All you need is:', 'When it comes to sampling objects, don’t be scared to try things. One good way to get the ball rolling is to head into different environments: say, a lounge, kitchen, or bathroom. This way you’ll get a completely different palette of sounds, leading to more creative options. Smartphone microphones are really good now. Many of the samples included in this article were recorded using an iPhone mic, so don’t let gear hold you back.', 'The best samples are recorded in a quiet environment, as it reduces the amount of audio repair needed while editing. Think of objects in relation to actual musical instruments. Would this make a good kick? Does this have any tonal qualities that could be used for a melodic instrument? And so on.', 'Playing a sound source with different tools offers many different timbral qualities. Many of the clips below were played two to three times using tools made from different materials:', "When recording, ensure that you’re not distorting the microphone input. A good ballpark figure is anywhere between -6 to -10dBFS, as it's much easier to increase gain later on, as opposed to restoring a clipped signal.", 'Different microphones and mic placement can also impact the tone and character of a recording. If you’ve really got the itch, a modelling microphone such as the Slate Digital VMS ML-2 could be a good way to explore different sonic options in post.', 'Once you’ve imported your samples into your DAW of choice, it’s time to begin editing. I always begin the editing phase simply by listening to the samples I’ve recorded and making markers on the timeline of good takes.', 'The sample should play back from the very first transient and then fade out to your desired length. This is to allow for easy playback in samplers later on. The tone-shaping of most sounds can be quite simple, if they’ve been recorded well. Some basic gain-staging, EQ, and compression can go a long way.', 'Most samples will benefit from a high-pass filter to roll off any unwanted rumble in the low-end. The same goes for filtering out any high frequencies and resonant peaks that might be unpleasant to the ear. Make sure your samples aren’t peaking too close to -0dB, as this will allow for little to no headroom during the creative processing.', "At some stage you’re going to run into noise issues. Hiss, hum, crackles, and pops are all pretty common but can be repaired thanks to various software. iZotope RX7 offers the most versatile audio repair assistant for treating and restoring damaged audio. If that's out of your budget, the Waves Z-Noise and WNS offer great value for money. The samples below were all treated using EQ, mild compression, and the Waves noise reduction suite to show that this doesn’t have to cost you the Earth.", 'Finish by exporting the samples as 24-bit 44.1kHz wav or AIFF files. If you’re wanting to later pitch-shift samples down, exporting at higher sample rates such as 48 and 96kHz can offer better results and avoid unwanted artefacts.', "You’ve recorded your sounds, edited and bounced them, and now it's the part we all love: getting creative, and making inspiring sound design and music.", 'Begin by importing all of your samples into a new session. Then start layering these samples on top of one another. Solo and mute different channels to see how they individually colour the overall sound. Then get a rough overall balance using the faders and panning, and bounce this in session as one whole stem. You can always go back later on and make adjustments to the levels and panning of individual elements.', 'I like to begin by creating one basic sample for each instrument category. Kick, snare, bass, lead, and sound effects. This gives you coverage for creating most genres of music, and can be manipulated further to taste.', 'The key to creating rich samples is to blend lots of different layers for tonal variation. For example, my kick sample is curated from three different sources. The low impact shower door, the log stove for some mid texture and the tin can mallet strike for some bite. I then repeated this process of trial and error for the other instruments.', 'Before finally loading all of my sounds into samplers, I did some overall bus processing. Here are just a few plugins and techniques that I’ve found useful for manipulating sounds:', 'Transient designers: If you’re lacking attack and sustain (particularly on percussive sounds), transient designers can offer a great way to sculpt and shape the impact and length of a sample. The sustain control is also great for reducing ambience and reverb.', 'Sub-harmonic generator: Two plugins come to mind when requiring artificial low-end: Waves RBass, and the Brainworx BX_subsynth.', 'Saturation: There are so many great saturation plugins available now, but SoundToys have long remained the obvious choice when it comes to distortion and grit. I use the Decapitator and Devil-Loc on just about everything… Who doesn’t?', "Now you’ve got your own unique and bespoke set of samples, it's time to take them to the playground. The piece of music here is something I really quickly whipped up using my processed samples and three different sample-based engines.", 'Presonus Impact XT: This harks back to the Akai MPC, the sampler/sequencer made famous by J Dilla and other hip-hop producers. A great all-rounder for creating beats and drum parts.', 'Output Arcade: Aside from Arcade already offering some brilliant samples packs, the in-built sample engine has some great features for manipulating your own sounds. Different playback modes and custom macros make this sampler a great choice for just about any purpose.', 'Arturia Pigments: I’m not saying this is my favourite VST synthesizer... but it’s my favourite VST synthesizer. This powerful synthesizer is packed with more features than I can explain in this article alone. Its recent update includes the addition of a sample-based engine and granular synth processor, making this by far the most advanced sound design tool on the list.

At which point there's a step change—and not only because of the emergence of the magnetic tape recorder. At the same time, electronic music pioneers embraced a more prosaic piece of electronic equipment: the audio test oscillator.", 'In electronic music, the tape recorder was adapted from its primary purpose (recording sound) to a new one (manipulating sound). The test oscillator was reimagined in a similar way.', "Test oscillators typically generate a sine wave, the frequency or pitch of which is controlled by a large rotary dial, and they are designed to measure the response of electrical circuits. They're often used with oscilloscopes, where you put the wave through a piece of kit and see what comes out the other end.", 'However, once sonic explorers cottoned on to the musical potential of an infinitely variable tone, the test oscillator became a preferred sound source, one that could be manually "played," by turning the dial, and processed, through tape editing and filters. And in the years after the end of World War II, there was a glut of military-surplus oscillators. So they were going cheap.', 'As is often the way at the intersection of music and technology, lots of people had similar ideas at the same time. The founding figures of British electronic music, Tristram Cary and Daphne Oram, were both born in 1925. Both attended private schools, and both showed some early musical promise. And by the end of World War II, both were ruminating on the possibilities of electronic sound in music.', 'In 1943, Oram started worked at the BBC as a junior studio engineer and music balancer. That same year, Cary joined the Navy as a radar operator. Both jobs involved using test oscillators. Cary left the Navy in 1946 and began building "the Machine," a ragbag of gadgets mounted on an old table and intended to make electronic music. In time, it would incorporate a disc-cutting lathe, which he bought with his demobilization pay, and a collection of military-surplus oscillators.', 'From the late \'40s, news of the experiments in musique concrète in Paris and then elektronische musik in Cologne began to filter through to London. Pierre Schaeffer in Paris held to the principle of manipulating "real" sounds using disc-cutting lathes and tape.', "Karlheinz Stockhausen studied with Schaeffer in 1952 and learned tape-editing techniques before moving to Cologne in '53 to work at the newly established Studio for Electronic Music of the West German Radio in Cologne. Here, the favored audio raw material was electronically created sound, and the proposed sources were two early instruments, the Monochord and the Melochord. Stockhausen thought them limiting and advocated using oscillator sine waves as compositional building blocks, demonstrating his approach with Studie I and Studie II in 1953 and '54.", 'In the UK, Oram in particular looked on in envy, as the Paris and Cologne studios were located in and funded by state radio stations. It took a while for the BBC to catch up. Gradually, though, whispers from the electronic future were heard over the airwaves. In 1955, Cary soundtracked a BBC radio play, The Japanese Fisherman, with manipulated percussive hits and oscillator drones, the first electronic score on British radio.', "In 1957, Oram used tape recorders, oscillators, and filters to create music for a BBC TV adaptation of Amphitryon 38, by the French dramatist Jean Giraudoux. Broadcast in March the following year, this was the first electronic score on British television. Although palpably alien compared to any music performed on conventional instruments, Oram's score was recognizably musical. Where Cary's Fisherman piece was closer to what we'd now call sound design, Oram extracted an almost woodwind-like melody from the oscillators.", "By the time Amphitryon 38 was broadcast, Oram, along with Desmond Briscoe, was lobbying the BBC to set up what would become the Radiophonic Workshop. This opened on April Fools' Day 1958, in Maida Vale, west London, under the leadership of Oram and Briscoe. History doesn't record a comprehensive list of equipment in the workshop when it opened. It's known that Oram and Briscoe acquired assorted tape recorders, turntables, and oscillators from other BBC departments along with a pre-war mixing board from the Royal Albert Hall. Louis Niebur's book Special Sound lists some new equipment bought with a budget of £1,900, including a Muirhead One Decade D-650B Oscillator that cost £313.", "Although the Workshop acquired a couple of large electronic keyboard instruments in the early days, oscillators remained its choice source of electronic sound until the late '60s and the arrival of EMS synthesizers. Photos from a few years after the Workshop opened show banks of oscillators controlled by a single-octave keyboard. Delia Derbyshire used an oscillator for the top melody line of her famed Doctor Who theme (1962).", 'During the same period in the US, popular and serious electronic composers were joining in. Bernard Herrmann used oscillator swoops alongside twin Theremins in the soundtrack to The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951). Composer Pauline Oliveros, later a prime mover in the San Francisco Tape Music Center, deployed oscillators in her early work. Talking to Steve Silverstein toward the end of her life, Oliveros said:', '"I made my own way of making electronic music in the late \'50s, early \'60s, using test equipment—oscillators and patchbays and tape recorders. … I was finding a way to improvise with the electronics. That improvisation system was using difference tones between oscillators. Setting oscillators above the range of hearing and using the difference tones between the oscillators in a tape delay system caused a lot of beat frequencies with the bias of the tape recorder."', "Louis and Bebe Barron had started to combine tape manipulation techniques with oscillator tones in the late '40s, though unusually it seems that Louis made their oscillators himself. The couple embarked on several projects with avant-garde film makers before their one mainstream commercial triumph, the score for Forbidden Planet (1956). By then, rock 'n' roll was on the way to becoming the dominant popular music genre, though it was a few years before oscillators found their place amid the electric guitars, basses, and drum kits.", "Paul Tanner was a session trombonist who'd played for Frank Sinatra. In a 1958 film soundtrack session, he witnessed a Thereminist struggling to pitch his instrument to the orchestra. This prompted Tanner to fashion a home-made instrument he called the electro-theremin. It was simply a test oscillator in a box with a manual slider, with notes marked on the box as a guide.", 'Tanner used his gadget for TV themes and various sessions. And then, famously, he got a call from Brian Wilson. This led to Tanner appearing on several Beach Boys songs, including "Good Vibrations" (1966). Around the time "Good Vibrations" was released, The Rolling Stones were recording Between The Buttons. The UK edition featured Brian Jones turning the dial of a test oscillator over a Bo Diddley rhythm on "Please Go Home." A year later, Brian was pulling the same trick on the Satanic Majesties album.', 'The Beach Boys and the Stones were just two examples of a trend at the time, when rock musicians went questing for new sounds—including, but not limited to, electronic sound. In the US in particular, this experimental drive gave rise to several underground bands who moved far closer to an entirely electronic approach than any contemporaneous mainstream acts. These included The United States of America, Fifty Foot Hose, and Silver Apples. What all these bands had in common was a reliance on one-off, hand-built oscillator-based instruments.', 'Silver Apples, a duo comprising Danny Taylor and Simeon Coxe, took this further than anyone. Taylor was the drummer, while Coxe manned what the sleevenotes to the band\'s debut described as "nine audio oscillators piled on top of each other and 86 manual controls to control lead, rhythm, and bass pulses with hands, feet, and elbows." This eccentric creation had no piano-style keyboard. Instead, Coxe triggered the oscillators through a selection of telegraph keys and foot pedals. It grew over time, too, with Coxe adding more oscillators and effects units and housing the lot in a collection of custom-made cabinets.', "Silver Apples was a going concern for a few years, touring America and releasing two albums, while never achieving commercial success. Their highest-profile appearance was a concert celebrating the Apollo 11 moon landings in New York City's Central Park. But by then, Coxe's oscillator monster was an anachronism. Moog and EMS were trading.", "Within a few years, you could choose from several decent synths for the price of a Telecaster. This put paid to what was—with hindsight—the first age of electronic music. Tape editing and oscillators passed out of mainstream practice, in both serious and popular music. Silver Apples split in 1970. When Coxe reformed the band decades later he had a more sensible rig, using contemporary technology, with one or two test oscillators for old times' sake.", 'These days, test oscillators are rarely used musically, and chances are if you hear a retro manipulated sine wave that sounds like it could have come from an oscillator, it\'s actually a hardware or software synth. But Nicolas Bernier keeps the flame burning with The Ensemble d\'oscillateurs (The Oscillator Ensemble). Inspired by the likes of Oliveros and Stockhausen, the 10-piece group performs entirely on vintage post-war oscillators. Speaking to Synthtopia in 2018, he said: "With only the frequency and volume as musical parameter, we are exploring ways to compose and improvise with sine waves, and a bit of square waves—nothing else."', 'About the Author: Mark Brend is an author and a musician.

Designed as solo melody devices to be attached to a piano or organ, they were the first mass-produced and widely used electronic instruments. And while they lack the cultish aura of the Theremin, the Ondes Martenot, or the Ondioline, they introduced the possibilities of electronic musical instruments to tens of thousands of musicians and millions of listeners.', 'In 1939, Hammond launched the Novachord, a polyphonic electronic keyboard that\'s a legitimate contender for the "first synth" title. Built into a walnut case, it weighed 500 pounds and looked like a harmonium crossed with a grand piano. It was expensive, complex to maintain, and hard to play. Though admired for its sounds, only about 1,000 were sold before production stopped in 1942.', "It's an intriguing proposition, mentioned here because it lent some technology to the Hammond Solovox, the first in a series of instruments sometimes described as piano attachments.", 'The Solovox was launched in 1940. Production was suspended in 1941, to run again from 1946 to 1950. Although the Solovox shared Novachord technology, it introduced the idea of the piano attachment, a different concept altogether. In common with all subsequent piano attachments, it has two main components.', 'First, a three-octave monophonic electronic keyboard, designed to fit underneath a piano or organ keyboard. Second, a "tone cabinet"—a combo amp. A knee-operated volume/expression lever was another feature copied in later, similar instruments. The idea was that you\'d play Solovox melodies with your right hand, leaving the left free to play chordal accompaniment on the host instrument.', "The Solovox's keys are smaller than a piano's, and that, along with the chunky rocker switches that select the Solovox's various sounds, lends the unit something of the appearance of an accordion. These features survived in subsequent instruments, too.", 'The Solovox was aimed at the popular and home musician—an instrument for dance halls, supper clubs, and living rooms. Though production didn\'t survive into the rock \'n\' roll era, you can hear one on "Sugar Shack" (1963) by Jimmy Gilmer and The Fireballs. By that time, the Solovox had long since given way to another piano attachment that had a distinct advantage over Hammond\'s instrument.', "The Clavioline was designed in 1947 by a Frenchman, Constant Martin (1910–95). Martin also built church organs, and he was responsible for the electronic bells in the city hall that sounded the liberation of Versailles in 1944. He licensed widely the manufacturing rights to his Clavioline, notably to Gibson and its parent company Chicago Musical Instrument (USA), Selmer (France and the UK), Jörgensen-Electronic (Germany), and Farfisa (Italy). Made in the tens of thousands, Claviolines were produced well into the '60s.", 'Like the Solovox, the Clavioline comprises a three-octave monophonic keyboard with under-sized keys, a combo amp, and a knee-operated volume control. The difference is that the keyboard packs into the back of the combo, making a single portable unit.', 'Max Crook, Del Shannon\'s keyboard player, was like many musicians who found this feature persuasive. He had considered a Solovox, but he told me the instrument was "very heavy, not to mention awkward to carry." You could pick up the Clavioline with one hand—just—and put it in the trunk of your car. More of Max Crook shortly.', 'Though visually similar, the Clavioline\'s keyboard includes another advance on the Solovox: a sliding switch that transposes the whole instrument an octave either way, giving it five octaves. In its day, the Clavioline was admired for its ability to mimic conventional instruments. Ads claimed it could reproduce "with amazing fidelity the tonal quality of more than 30 different musical instruments." The contemporary listener might beg to differ, although the alternately buzzy, droning, whistling tones retain a charm.', 'The Selmer Clavioline launched in 1950, with Gibson\'s appearing at 1952\'s NAMM trade show, where footage of it was broadcast daily over a closed television circuit. Both companies promoted Claviolines for domestic use, with ads showing genteel ladies at the home piano thrilled to "have a full orchestra at [their] fingertips."', 'It was working popular musicians who embraced the instrument. In the UK in particular, the Clavioline caught on. It dominated "Little Red Monkey" (1953) by Frank Chacksfield\'s Tunesmiths, thought to be the first British hit to use an electronic instrument. The John Barry Seven, an early vehicle for the film composer John Barry, used a Clavioline on their only album, Stringbeat (1961). In the USA, the Clavioline had a lower profile, until that same year when Del Shannon\'s "Runaway" was an international hit.', 'Written by Shannon and Max Crook, "Runaway" is now so familiar that any sense of its originality is lost. But it is an unusual record, with its minor to major key shift and the absence of a conventional repeated verse–chorus structure. And there\'s the instrumental break, taking up more than a fifth of the song, played by Crook on his Musitron—a contraction of music and electron—which was, in fact, a modified Clavioline.', 'Crook had bought a standard Gibson instrument in a pawnshop, disposed of the combo, and built up the Musitron. First he modified the keyboard by "putting in pots and resistors and switches into the circuit to make changes," he told me, which enhanced the instrument\'s range, "right up to where the dogs and cats are screaming."', "He added a pitchbend by attaching a spring-loaded mechanical lever to the keyboard's tuning pots. He then fed the modified keyboard through a sequence of home-made echo, reverb, and vibrato units into a more powerful amplifier. The Musitron also featured on subsequent Shannon hits, but Crook did not continue in music full-time. He kept the Musitron, though, and used it at Shannon tribute events and nostalgia-circuit gigs well into this century. He died in July 2020.", 'Back in the UK, the rogue producer Joe Meek had used Claviolines since the late \'50s. Of all his productions, the instrument is most associated with The Tornados\' international hit "Telstar" (1962). This prompted a brief revival of a quaint advertising war that had taken place in the British music press in the mid \'50s.', "When Selmer's Clavioline went on sale in Britain, Tom Jennings, whose company Jennings Musical Instruments produced accordions, was interested. He designed an instrument that conceptually was all but identical, but with enough circuit changes to ensure that it wouldn't infringe the Clavioline's patent, and he launched the Jennings Univox in 1952.", "Cosmetically, little distinguishes a Univox from a Clavioline. There's the three-octave monophonic keyboard, extendable to five, the volume knee-lever, and the combo amp, all packable together into one handy case. Initially, the Univox was supplied with clips to fasten it under a piano keyboard, like the Clavioline and Solovox before it. Later, a stand was offered so the Univox could be mounted on its own. Claviolines soon had their own stands, too.", 'From about 1953 to 1956, Selmer and Jennings posted ads quoting celebrity musicians eulogizing their instruments over other "similar products." The Univox was cheaper than the Clavioline at about 75 guineas (£81.15, or $230 then) compared to 125 guineas (£135.25, around $380 then) for the top of the range Selmer (Gibson launched its model at $395, about £140 then), but it was the Selmer that prevailed. Jennings was barely promoting its Univox by the late \'50s. That is, until "Telstar" in 1962.', 'Although most authorities insist that Meek used Claviolines to create the melody line, Jennings ran a Univox ad in 1962—the firm\'s first for a while—claiming that the Univox was the "Telstar" sound. Who knows? Records of an auction of Meek\'s equipment after his death show that he owned a Clavioline and a Univox.', '"Telstar" and "Runaway" marked the Clavioline\'s zenith, although the instruments continued to turn up in all sorts of music for years. John Barry and Sergio Leone used them in film scores. Sun Ra used one on his space-jazz freak-outs until he acquired a Minimoog. John Lennon is said to have rolled an orange up and down a Clavioline keyboard on "Baby You\'re A Rich Man."', "Apart from the big three—Solovox, Clavioline, Univox—there were other piano attachments, including the Lipp Pianoline, the Ondiola, and the Hohner Electronium Pi. The Maestrovox was another British instrument, appearing in 1953, and a deluxe version, the Orchestrain, took the concept to its logical extreme. The electronics were attached directly to the host piano's keys so that playing the piano triggered Maestrovox sounds. It doesn't seem to have caught on.", "Selmer's last Clavioline appeared in 1964—just the keyboard unit, to plug into any amplifier. Gibson had given up by then. Jörgensen was still promoting its Claviolines in 1965, but the game was almost up.

Designed as solo melody devices to be attached to a piano or organ, they were the first mass-produced and widely used electronic instruments. And while they lack the cultish aura of the Theremin, the Ondes Martenot, or the Ondioline, they introduced the possibilities of electronic musical instruments to tens of thousands of musicians and millions of listeners.', 'In 1939, Hammond launched the Novachord, a polyphonic electronic keyboard that\'s a legitimate contender for the "first synth" title. Built into a walnut case, it weighed 500 pounds and looked like a harmonium crossed with a grand piano. It was expensive, complex to maintain, and hard to play. Though admired for its sounds, only about 1,000 were sold before production stopped in 1942.', "It's an intriguing proposition, mentioned here because it lent some technology to the Hammond Solovox, the first in a series of instruments sometimes described as piano attachments.", 'The Solovox was launched in 1940. Production was suspended in 1941, to run again from 1946 to 1950. Although the Solovox shared Novachord technology, it introduced the idea of the piano attachment, a different concept altogether. In common with all subsequent piano attachments, it has two main components.', 'First, a three-octave monophonic electronic keyboard, designed to fit underneath a piano or organ keyboard. Second, a "tone cabinet"—a combo amp. A knee-operated volume/expression lever was another feature copied in later, similar instruments. The idea was that you\'d play Solovox melodies with your right hand, leaving the left free to play chordal accompaniment on the host instrument.', "The Solovox's keys are smaller than a piano's, and that, along with the chunky rocker switches that select the Solovox's various sounds, lends the unit something of the appearance of an accordion. These features survived in subsequent instruments, too.", 'The Solovox was aimed at the popular and home musician—an instrument for dance halls, supper clubs, and living rooms. Though production didn\'t survive into the rock \'n\' roll era, you can hear one on "Sugar Shack" (1963) by Jimmy Gilmer and The Fireballs. By that time, the Solovox had long since given way to another piano attachment that had a distinct advantage over Hammond\'s instrument.', "The Clavioline was designed in 1947 by a Frenchman, Constant Martin (1910–95). Martin also built church organs, and he was responsible for the electronic bells in the city hall that sounded the liberation of Versailles in 1944. He licensed widely the manufacturing rights to his Clavioline, notably to Gibson and its parent company Chicago Musical Instrument (USA), Selmer (France and the UK), Jörgensen-Electronic (Germany), and Farfisa (Italy). Made in the tens of thousands, Claviolines were produced well into the '60s.", 'Like the Solovox, the Clavioline comprises a three-octave monophonic keyboard with under-sized keys, a combo amp, and a knee-operated volume control. The difference is that the keyboard packs into the back of the combo, making a single portable unit.', 'Max Crook, Del Shannon\'s keyboard player, was like many musicians who found this feature persuasive. He had considered a Solovox, but he told me the instrument was "very heavy, not to mention awkward to carry." You could pick up the Clavioline with one hand—just—and put it in the trunk of your car. More of Max Crook shortly.', 'Though visually similar, the Clavioline\'s keyboard includes another advance on the Solovox: a sliding switch that transposes the whole instrument an octave either way, giving it five octaves. In its day, the Clavioline was admired for its ability to mimic conventional instruments. Ads claimed it could reproduce "with amazing fidelity the tonal quality of more than 30 different musical instruments." The contemporary listener might beg to differ, although the alternately buzzy, droning, whistling tones retain a charm.', 'The Selmer Clavioline launched in 1950, with Gibson\'s appearing at 1952\'s NAMM trade show, where footage of it was broadcast daily over a closed television circuit. Both companies promoted Claviolines for domestic use, with ads showing genteel ladies at the home piano thrilled to "have a full orchestra at [their] fingertips."', 'It was working popular musicians who embraced the instrument. In the UK in particular, the Clavioline caught on. It dominated "Little Red Monkey" (1953) by Frank Chacksfield\'s Tunesmiths, thought to be the first British hit to use an electronic instrument. The John Barry Seven, an early vehicle for the film composer John Barry, used a Clavioline on their only album, Stringbeat (1961). In the USA, the Clavioline had a lower profile, until that same year when Del Shannon\'s "Runaway" was an international hit.', 'Written by Shannon and Max Crook, "Runaway" is now so familiar that any sense of its originality is lost. But it is an unusual record, with its minor to major key shift and the absence of a conventional repeated verse–chorus structure. And there\'s the instrumental break, taking up more than a fifth of the song, played by Crook on his Musitron—a contraction of music and electron—which was, in fact, a modified Clavioline.', 'Crook had bought a standard Gibson instrument in a pawnshop, disposed of the combo, and built up the Musitron. First he modified the keyboard by "putting in pots and resistors and switches into the circuit to make changes," he told me, which enhanced the instrument\'s range, "right up to where the dogs and cats are screaming."', "He added a pitchbend by attaching a spring-loaded mechanical lever to the keyboard's tuning pots. He then fed the modified keyboard through a sequence of home-made echo, reverb, and vibrato units into a more powerful amplifier. The Musitron also featured on subsequent Shannon hits, but Crook did not continue in music full-time. He kept the Musitron, though, and used it at Shannon tribute events and nostalgia-circuit gigs well into this century. He died in July 2020.", 'Back in the UK, the rogue producer Joe Meek had used Claviolines since the late \'50s. Of all his productions, the instrument is most associated with The Tornados\' international hit "Telstar" (1962). This prompted a brief revival of a quaint advertising war that had taken place in the British music press in the mid \'50s.', "When Selmer's Clavioline went on sale in Britain, Tom Jennings, whose company Jennings Musical Instruments produced accordions, was interested. He designed an instrument that conceptually was all but identical, but with enough circuit changes to ensure that it wouldn't infringe the Clavioline's patent, and he launched the Jennings Univox in 1952.", "Cosmetically, little distinguishes a Univox from a Clavioline. There's the three-octave monophonic keyboard, extendable to five, the volume knee-lever, and the combo amp, all packable together into one handy case. Initially, the Univox was supplied with clips to fasten it under a piano keyboard, like the Clavioline and Solovox before it. Later, a stand was offered so the Univox could be mounted on its own. Claviolines soon had their own stands, too.", 'From about 1953 to 1956, Selmer and Jennings posted ads quoting celebrity musicians eulogizing their instruments over other "similar products." The Univox was cheaper than the Clavioline at about 75 guineas (£81.15, or $230 then) compared to 125 guineas (£135.25, around $380 then) for the top of the range Selmer (Gibson launched its model at $395, about £140 then), but it was the Selmer that prevailed. Jennings was barely promoting its Univox by the late \'50s. That is, until "Telstar" in 1962.', 'Although most authorities insist that Meek used Claviolines to create the melody line, Jennings ran a Univox ad in 1962—the firm\'s first for a while—claiming that the Univox was the "Telstar" sound. Who knows? Records of an auction of Meek\'s equipment after his death show that he owned a Clavioline and a Univox.', '"Telstar" and "Runaway" marked the Clavioline\'s zenith, although the instruments continued to turn up in all sorts of music for years. John Barry and Sergio Leone used them in film scores. Sun Ra used one on his space-jazz freak-outs until he acquired a Minimoog. John Lennon is said to have rolled an orange up and down a Clavioline keyboard on "Baby You\'re A Rich Man."', "Apart from the big three—Solovox, Clavioline, Univox—there were other piano attachments, including the Lipp Pianoline, the Ondiola, and the Hohner Electronium Pi. The Maestrovox was another British instrument, appearing in 1953, and a deluxe version, the Orchestrain, took the concept to its logical extreme. The electronics were attached directly to the host piano's keys so that playing the piano triggered Maestrovox sounds. It doesn't seem to have caught on.", "Selmer's last Clavioline appeared in 1964—just the keyboard unit, to plug into any amplifier. Gibson had given up by then. Jörgensen was still promoting its Claviolines in 1965, but the game was almost up. The Minimoog was only a few years away.", 'Claviolines were consigned to cellars, attics, and garages, or just chucked away. They and other similar instruments turn up for sale quite regularly now—invariably described as "requiring restoration" or something similar.
