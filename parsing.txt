original Goldtop stylings through Juniors, Specials, Customs, Deluxes, and more. And as one of the most remade and reissued guitars to ever exist, there are many modern versions of the vintage classics.', "Let's take a look at some prime examples of vintage Les Pauls, starting from the 1952 originals through the 1970s. You can also find links to standard production and Custom Shop models from recent years that pay homage to the specific vintage models.", 'Need a hand finding the right Les Paul for you? Visit our Les Paul Buying Guide.', "The Les Paul that started it all. Upon its introduction, the new model sported a pair of single-coil P90 pickups, a clumsy trapeze tailpiece, and a mahogany slab body with a curved maple top. Les Paul himself endorsed a solid gold finish to make the guitar appear high-end and luxurious when compared to Fender's more utilitarian Telecaster, released the year before.", "Modern alternatives: Gibson Les Paul '52 Tribute, Custom Shop Historic Collection '52 Les Paul Goldtop Reissue.", 'While Les Paul was a well-known innovator often credited with the development of the solidbody guitar itself, his contribution to the new model remains controversial. He did have some say in the selection of woods as well as the trapeze bridge, though most of the actual design was spearheaded by Gibson chief Ted McCarty. By early 1953, a new combination wraparound bridge-tailpiece replaced the original trapeze design.', "In conjunction with the evolution of the tailpiece, Gibson's engineers also gradually increased the depth of Les Paul's neck angle. This change improved the action of the instrument by allowing easier adjustment of the bridge. By 1954, Gibson had expanded the Les Paul line with the student-level Les Paul Junior and the top-of-the-line Les Paul Custom.", "Modern alternatives: 1954 Les Paul Goldtop Reissue, Les Paul Standard '50s P90 (with tailpiece and Tune-O-Matic instead of wraparound bridge).", "Like the Goldtop, the Les Paul Custom's tuxedo-like cosmetics were meant to look high-end, earning this model the nickname Black Beauty. The Custom differed from the Standard in its use of multi-ply binding, square inlays on an ebony fingerboard, gold-plated parts and comparatively low frets. The Custom also did not incorporate a maple top in its body as the Standard did. This model was the first to use the new stopbar tailpiece and Tune-O-Matic bridge, an innovation closely associated with Ted McCarty, which was added to the standard in 1955.", 'To complement the higher-end Les Paul and Les Paul Custom, Gibson also introduced two student-level Les Paul models in the \'50s: the Les Paul Junior and Les Paul Special. These guitars lacked the curved maple cap of their more expensive counterparts, and used a more Telecaster-like slab body style. While the Junior packed just one P90, the Special sported two. The other main difference is that the Special had a snazzy TV Yellow finish, while the Junior offered a more traditional sunburst (though a yellow version of the Junior was also produced as the "TV Model").', "Modern alternatives: Les Paul Special, Les Paul Special Tribute P90, Custom Shop '57 Les Paul Special Reissue TV Yellow, 1956 Les Paul Goldtop Reissue, Custom Shop Historic '56 Les Paul Goldtop Reissue.", 'The introduction of the stopbar tailpiece and Tune-O-Matic bridge brought the Les Paul close to the format of the modern Les Paul. The addition of the Seth Lover-designed "Patent Applied For," or PAF, humbuckers elevated the Les Paul to a status of all-time icon. By connecting two pickup coils in series and out-of-phase, Lover and Gibson sought to combat the common 60-cycle hum of conventional pickups. This innovation also fostered a beefier new tone that would be embraced by rock musicians for decades to come.', "Modern alternatives: Les Paul Standard '50s Goldtop, Les Paul Studio '50s Tribute with Humbuckers, Custom Shop 50th Anniversary '57 Les Paul Goldtop.", 'Like the Les Paul Standard, the Les Paul Custom received the humbucker makeover in 1957. The Custom, however, packed three humbuckers instead of two (though some examples maintained the traditional two pickup configuration). In 1958, Gibson switched from Kluson tuners to Grover Rotomatics for the Custom.', 'Modern alternatives: 1957 Les Paul Custom Reissue 3-Pickup, Epiphone Joe Bonamassa Black Beauty Les Paul Custom Outfit.', 'Much like the Les Paul Special, the Les Paul Junior began life as a single-cutaway, lower-end Les Paul-shaped guitar. Neither model made the jump to humbuckers and continued to use the single-piece bridge/tailpiece instead of the Tune-O-Matic. In mid-1958, both models changed to a double-cutaway body shape, which was replaced by the SG body shape in 1961.', "Modern alternatives: Les Paul Junior Tribute, Custom Shop '58 Les Paul Junior Double Cut Reissue, Custom Shop Historic Collection '58 Les Paul Junior Double Cut.", 'In the fall of 1958, Gibson abandoned the original Goldtop finish in favor of a new Cherry Sunburst. The "Burst" Les Pauls of late 1958 to late 1960 remain atop the list of the most collectible guitars ever made. The 1960 model, in particular, is known for having a slimmer neck, leading many modern Gibson models to either replicate the slim \'60s neck profile or the fatter \'50s neck profile.', "Modern alternatives: Les Paul Standard '50s, Les Paul Standard '60s, Les Paul Standard (1990 - 2001), Les Paul Standard with '60s Neck Profile, Custom Shop 60th Anniversary '59 Les Paul Standard Reissue, Custom Shop Special Order '59 Les Paul Standard Reissue, Custom Shop Standard Historic '59 Les Paul Standard (2013 - 2017), Custom Shop Historic '59 Les Paul Standard Reissue (2020), Custom Shop Special Order '60 Les Paul Standard Reissue, Custom Shop Standard Historic '60 Les Paul Standard Reissue (2013 - 2017), Custom Shop 60th Anniversary '60 Les Paul Standard Reissue.", 'By the close of 1960, sales of Gibson\'s flagship solidbody, the Les Paul, were waning. While maintaining the Les Paul moniker, Gibson designers completely changed the model\'s body shape with two sharp cutaways and beveled edges. Gibson retained the dual humbucker configuration (with original PAF humbuckers up until 1962) and implemented a new vibrato system with a lever that pulls to the side. This body shape would eventually be known as the SG for "solid guitar," and today, this is most often referred to as the first SG, but in 1961, it was technically a Les Paul.', "Modern alternatives: SG Standard '61, Gibson SG Standard '61 with Maestro Vibrola, '61 SG Reissue, Custom Shop '61 Les Paul SG Standard Reissue, Custom Shop '61 Les Paul SG Standard Reissue with Vibrola, Custom Shop 60th Anniversary '61 Les Paul SG Standard, '61 SG / Les Paul Reissue with Deluxe Vibrola (1999 - 2002).", 'Like the Les Paul Standard, the Les Paul Custom also made the leap to the SG body shape by 1961. Apart from the body shape and finish, the original SG-style Les Paul Custom shared much with its single-cutaway predecessor. Both models featured block inlays on the fingerboard with the unique diamond headstock inlay design. These guitars also used a triple set of humbucker pickups which changed from PAF (Patent Applied For) humbuckers to Patent Number pickups in mid-1962.', "Modern alternatives: Custom Shop 60th Anniversary '61 Les Paul SG Custom, Custom Shop '63 Les Paul SG Custom Reissue with Maestro, Custom Shop Murphy Lab '63 Les Paul SG Custom Reissue, '61 / '62 SG Custom Reissue (1987-1991).", "The Les Paul Junior and its two-pickup counterpart, the Les Paul Special, both switched to the SG body shape after a stint with a double cutaway slab body shape in the '50s that was not used on the Standard and Custom. According to most accounts, Les Paul himself was never happy with the SG body style, which prompted the removal of his name from the model in 1963.", "Modern alternatives: SG Junior, SG Junior '60s, Custom Shop '63 SG Junior Reissue Lightning Bar, Custom Shop Brian Ray '62 SG Junior.", "After the Les Paul name was dropped and the SG name was introduced, no Les Pauls were produced until 1968, when interest in the original Les Pauls of the '50s was on the rise. When Gibson first brought back the Les Paul Standard, the new model was most similar to the 1956 model, with a Goldtop finish and two P90 pickups instead of humbuckers. These guitars can be seen as the first Les Paul reissues. The original '68 models are very close to the '50s Les Paul, save for a few details, such as Indian instead of Brazilian Rosewood for the fingerboard and chrome instead of nickel hardware.", 'Modern alternative: 1968 Les Paul Standard Goldtop Reissue.', 'Like the Les Paul Standard, Gibson brought back the Les Paul Custom in 1968. This model was also very similar to its \'50s counterparts, but featured a maple top on the mahogany body, where most \'50s Customs used all-mahogany bodies. Both of these reissue models changed through 1969 with the introduction of a three-ply "pancake body" and a three-piece laminated mahogany neck with a volute (a small bump) where the neck meets the headstock. For collectors, these changes all signify a steady departure from the pinnacle designs of the \'50s and the beginning of a general decline in quality that would continue into the \'70s.', "Modern alternatives: Les Paul Custom, Les Paul Custom (1990-2011), Custom Shop '68 Les Paul Custom Reissue.", 'The pancake-style body—a four-ply body construction style with two plies of mahogany, a thin ply of maple, and a maple top—continued until 1977. In this era, Gibson started producing the Custom in new finishes including the Cherry Sunburst seen above.', 'Starting in 1969, Gibson\'s main production Les Paul was dubbed the Les Paul Deluxe. The Les Paul Deluxe differed from the original Standard in its use of mini-humbuckers instead of PAFs, and its use of the four-ply "pancake" body style. The Les Paul Standard was not actually brought back to the Gibson catalog until 1976. Between 1972 and 1975, you could special order a Les Paul Deluxe with normal-sized humbuckers and the word "Standard" on the truss-rod cover; for all intents and purposes, these Deluxes were Les Paul Standards even if not on paper.', "Modern alternatives: Les Paul '70s Deluxe, Les Paul Deluxe 30th Anniversary, Les Paul Deluxe (2004-2005), Les Paul Deluxe 2015.", 'Perhaps the strangest new Les Pauls brought about in this era are the Les Paul Professional, Personal, and Recording (pictured). In 1969, the Les Paul Personal and Professional launched with new low-impedance oblong pickups and an onboard phase switch. The Personal was the higher-end of the two, featuring gold-plated hardware and multi-ply binding like a Les Paul Custom. Both models were replaced by the Les Paul Recording in 1971, which introduced a high/low impedance switch with internal transistor. This guitar was considered a personal favorite of Les Paul himself.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Founders of new musical genres. Pioneers in experimental electronic music. Throbbing Gristle were all of these things and much more.', 'The group was born from the ashes of performance group COUM Transmissions and founded in 1975 by Genesis P-Orridge, Cosey Fanni Tutti, Chris Carter, and Peter "Sleazy" Christopherson. Over a period of five years, Throbbing Gristle released a series of uncompromising records that they called "industrial music." Their sound was unique, synthetic, effects-heavy, and often terrifying—a blueprint that would go on to inspire hundreds of future groups.', 'A lot of mystery still surrounds the machines behind the music of Throbbing Gristle. Although much of their equipment was store-bought and used by a lot of their contemporaries, there were a few key differences that ensured they didn’t really sound like anyone else.', 'Even today, with so much past music being faultlessly recreated, their records are still largely unfathomable. This is due in large part to Chris Carter’s electronics knowledge, which enabled him to build, modify, and otherwise develop original instruments and effects.', 'In this piece, we’ll look at the equipment that Throbbing Gristle used in their first iteration (roughly the period from 1976-1981), including Carter’s unique creations and modifications.', 'Although Throbbing Gristle (TG) basically used the same instruments as everyone else—vocals, guitar, bass, and synthesizers—what set them apart was the way they processed everything with effects. Effects were not new in the late ‘70s, of course, but TG employed them almost as if each was an instrument in itself.', 'First and foremost, TG wouldn’t be TG without the Gristleizer—a homemade effects unit based around Roy Gwinn’s Guitar Effects Pedal circuit first published in Practical Electronics magazine in July of 1975. A half-rack box covered in Tolex, it had knobs for speed, depth, LFO shape, bias, and amount of effect. It also had a switch to change between VCF and VCA, and a power switch. It was powered by batteries.', '"The basic unit was a voltage-controlled filter and voltage-controlled amp with an LFO," Carter told Sound On Sound in 2015. "But you could only switch between one or the other, it had to be either a VCF or a VCA, and then it had various waveforms for the LFO. Whatever you put through it at line level, it would modulate the sound to the speed of the LFO. You could overdrive it quite easily, so it had that sort of fizzy distortion sound along with this modulation."', 'Every member had at least one Gristleizer at hand, with Genesis and Carter both using two. "The beauty of the Gristleizers was that its range of sounds was so extreme, which also meant it could sound completely different depending on the instrument," Carter explained to Planet Origo in 2004.', '"The sounds included slow modulated filtering, a metallic ring-modulation effect, clipped and fuzzed distortion, and tremolo. At the time, there was no other battery-powered effect unit capable of such a wide and weird range of sounds." The Gristleizer was later made into a Eurorack module by Future Sound Systems working with Chris Carter and Roy Gwinn.', 'Eventide Harmonizers—particularly the HM80—were also a core part of the TG sound. Each member had an effects chain that started with a Gristleizer and then passed through a Harmonizer. This would then be fed into a tape echo, likely a Roland RE-201 (the band had two), a Watkins Copicat, and later a Roland Chorus Echo SRE-555. TG were also known to use more typical stompbox effects as well, like various fuzzes, a flanger (such as the Boss BF-2), phase, wah-wah, and chorus (particularly the Boss CE-2).', 'The core of the electronic sound of TG was made with a hybrid Roland System 100m rig. Carter worked with a combination of Roland modules and Digisound kits that he modified and painted to fit into the Roland racks. The system expanded throughout TG’s first period (as modular systems tend to do!), but his main system was comprised of 191-J and 190 racks, a 112 dual VCO, 110 VCO/VCF/VCA combo unit, a 140 dual envelope and LFO unit, and a 182 sequencer.', 'Later he added another 182, a 172 phase/delay, a 121 dual VCF, a 130 VCA, and 131 mixer. To this he added a dozen or so Digisound modules, which included VCAs, VCFs, envelope generators, envelope followers, and ring modulators.', 'Carter was a Roland fan, and his rig also included a Roland SH-3A, SH-1, SH-5, SH-7, and SH-2. The SH-3A can be heard on "AB/7A" on D.o.A.: the Third and Final Report, sequenced by a Roland Model 104—the analog sequencer from the System 100 (which was apparently Carter’s only piece of gear from the famous system).', 'Now, about that tape machine. While it’s true that professional samplers did exist in the late ‘70s (the Fairlight CMI was released in 1979), true to form, TG built their own (although in a decidedly analog and low-tech way).', 'Where Genesis sang and played bass, Cosey handled guitar and trumpet duties, and Chris was the mad synthesist, Sleazy preferred to work with tape. He returned from a trip to New York with four new Sony Walkmans, and with these, he and Carter created a kind of proto-sampler.', '"We sat down and figured out a way that we could trigger the tapes from a keyboard," Carter explained in the same interview with Sound On Sound. "I had a small one-octave keyboard, and I put relays on it, so by playing the keyboard he could switch them on and off with his fingers." Sleazy used this to trigger secretly recorded conversations, bits of audio from TV and radio, and tape loops made by Carter on his modular rig.', 'Less exciting but no less important to the sound of TG was the gear behind the gear: the mixers, microphones, and tape decks used to record the albums.', 'As befitting a group that was more concerned with sonic exploration than pristine sound, they used a slapdash mixer system that evolved over the years and included a Soundcraft, Tascam, Boss KM-4, and two Seck mixers chained together. For microphones, Genesis preferred Shure SM58s, likely for their durability. They used these on their amps as well.', 'TG operated out of their own studio, which they called The Death Factory. They didn’t own their own tape deck and would rent them as needed. Because Sleazy was on the staff at Hipgnosis, the design company famous for working with Pink Floyd, the band often rented Studer 2-inch 16-track tape machines from Floyd’s Britannia Row studio. From wreckers of civilization to associates of Pink Floyd.', 'Throbbing Gristle broke up in 1981, and Genesis and Sleazy soon formed Psychic TV, with Sleazy later forming Coil with John Balance. Chris and Cosey continued on making music as well. The four reunited in 2004, releasing new music and touring. Sleazy passed away in 2010, ending the band, and Genesis passed away in 2020.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/news/potent-pairings-how-to-sound-like-blur'], ["Few musical genres have had the effect that Britpop had in the UK in the 1990s. Britpop was more than just a style of music—it was a movement that inspired changes in fashion, culture, and TV all around the same time. Though the term Britpop is fairly loosely defined, it normally refers to guitar bands of the mid-'90s that were generally rock, indie, or alternative in style—Oasis, Pulp, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene, and Suede are all examples.", "The influence of '60s and '70s rock and pop was huge within Britpop. However, its close association with the Cool Britannia movement (a sort of increased sense of pride in Britain around the time) also meant that British pop acts like the Spice Girls were sometimes caught up in it too. Even Tony Blair—the newly elected British Prime Minister in 1997—aligned himself with Britpop.", 'Britpop rejuvenated guitar music in the \'90s in the UK. Whilst shoegaze and grunge were undoubtedly popular in the early \'90s, when Britpop came along, bands like Oasis and Blur were gracing the front page of the newspapers and making national TV news headlines. Oasis and Blur releasing singles at the same time was even dubbed the "Battle of Britpop" in 1995 and dominated the press. It exploded in the UK, and it helped make the guitar considerably more popular.', 'Even today, there are new British bands like Blossoms and The Sherlocks wearing their Britpop influences proudly on their sleeves. It’s hard to imagine the indie scene kicking off in the 2000s without Britpop in the decade preceding—the likes of Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Killers all owe something to it.', 'It’s fair to say that Britpop had a huge, lasting impact on guitar music and players. In the same way that the Fender Strat is associated with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and the Gibson Les Paul with Jimmy Page, Slash, and Peter Green, the Epiphone Sheraton is often seen as the "Noel Gallagher guitar."', 'Here we’ll go through some of the key guitarists and gear within Britpop, looking at some of the biggest names associated with the genre and some of the smaller, more underrated players whose influence shouldn’t be overlooked.', "Blur was one of the biggest bands to wear the Britpop badge, and one of the biggest bands of the '90s altogether. They provided a counterbalance to Oasis while residing in the same musical ballpark. Coxon was the only guitarist in the band and had a great knack for blending rhythm and lead parts to create fluid guitar lines that helped drive the songs. This perfectly complemented Alex James’ far-from-simple basslines.", "Blur had a defined sound right from the start, taking just as much influence from post-punk as from '60s pop. Their first two albums enjoyed some success in the UK, but their third album, Parklife is synonymous with the Britpop movement to this day.", '"Girls And Boys" features some incredibly creative guitar playing, showcasing jarring riffs and licks that sit on top of a groove-soaked disco bassline. Every song on Parklife is a masterclass in playing guitar for the song without being boring for one second. Their success and, indeed, Coxon’s playing went from strength to strength for years after that, until Graham left the band in 2002.', "Graham Coxon is probably most closely associated with the Fender Telecaster—he even got his own signature model in 2011, based off of his late-'60s Tele modded with a Gibson humbucker in the neck position. He quite often played a ’52 Tele Reissue but also used a Gibson Les Paul Custom in Blur’s heyday, as well as a 335 and a Fender Jaguar amongst many others. Different songs would often feature different playing styles, so Coxon would choose the right guitar for the song.", 'In terms of amps, he’d almost always be running into a Marshall Super Lead head through a 4x12. There are some pictures of him using a Marshall PB100 in between the head and cab, too.', 'Coxon is also a big fan of using pedals and often used different distortions, fuzzes, and overdrives almost like channels on an amp to boost and cut volumes in addition to adding gain. The ProCo RAT 2 was often used, as were a number of Boss pedals, including the DS-1 Distortion, BF-2 Flanger, DD-3 Delay and more. Oh, and if you’re after the "Song 2" pedal, that would be the Dod FX76 Punkifier.', 'If you had to assign one band to the Britpop movement, it would have to be Oasis. Fronted by Liam Gallagher, with his older brother Noel on backing vocal and lead guitar duties, Oasis had a long career, adorned with some truly timeless and classic songs.', "Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in 1994 to an incredible reaction. Music fans, particularly in the UK, were perhaps unknowingly waiting for a band like this to come along after the huge pop wave of the '80s and grunge of the early '90s. Oasis wrote songs about things that they knew, which, coming from a working class background, meant that plenty of people could relate to them.", 'What followed their debut album was a meteoric rise (despite their now-legendary second album, (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?, receiving fairly negative reviews at the time) that accumulated in one of the most iconic live concerts of all time—two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 people. If you had to place when the peak of Britpop was, it was probably then.', 'Oasis then returned with their third album, Be Here Now, which was received fairly well but lacked a lot of what made the first two special. This record instead boasted a collection of multi-layered, five- and 6-plus minute songs that were heavy with the weight of unnecessary guitar layers. They did produce some incredible stuff after that, though, and after splitting up in 2009, both Liam and Noel have since gone on to enjoy very successful solo careers.', 'The Oasis sound was massive—it was a wall of guitars, accompanied by Liam’s (and sometimes Noel’s) unique voice. They had two guitar players, Noel and Bonehead (until 1999), and no keyboard player until later, so it was a combination of their chord inversions, playing styles, and rigs that made them sound so big. Bonehead would usually be playing barre chords, leaving Noel to play open chords, allowing more strings to ring out. Alternatively, Noel would play single-note riffs on top of chords, and when called for, a guitar solo.', "Over the years, Noel Gallagher has used a lot of gear. He’s often mentioned in the same breath as the Epiphone Sheraton, having played a '60s model in the early days of Oasis. Epiphone made a Union Jack Sheraton that was a clear nod to the model given to him by his then-girlfriend for their Manchester Maine Road gigs in 1996. Epiphone also made a Noel Gallagher Supernova signature model, which is a bit of a cross between a Sheraton and a Riviera. He and Bonehead also played Japanese Epiphone Rivieras, so hollowbodies are a way to go if you’re seeking that early Oasis sound.", 'Gallagher also played Les Pauls. Really early on, he played an Epiphone Les Paul Standard; that is, until Johnny Marr lent him an original 1952 Les Paul, converted to 1960 spec. This guitar was unfortunately broken when used as a weapon after their stage was stormed by a fan.', 'Marr then lent him another guitar, this time a black Les Paul Custom. Noel also had a 1967 Gibson Non-Reverse Firebird in the early Oasis days, and throughout his career, he’s been known to play a Rickenbacker 330 (including a white one given to him by Paul Weller), Fender Telecasters, and more recently, a Nash Jazzmaster, amongst many others.', 'Likewise with amps, Noel has used a lot, though Marshalls nearly always tend to feature. Presumably before the budget allowed for more, Noel used what looks like a Valvestate Marshall combo—possibly an 8080 model—and sometimes a Vox AC30.', "He then moved on to Marshall stacks, with a JCM900 on top of 4x12s, as well as an Orange OR120, before moving on to a more complex rig, post-Britpop. Though not a huge pedal person in the '90s, Noel did use a TS9 Tubescreamer as part of his core sound to boost for solos, as well as a Roland Space Echo and possibly a Boss DD-3 or DD-5.", 'Elastica was formed by Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch—two of the original members of another huge Britpop act, Suede. They took a lot of influence from new wave and post-punk bands of the \'70s and \'80s and had a huge hit with their single "Connection"—the guitar break after the first chorus is one of the most iconic of the genre.', 'Their debut album sold incredibly well, and actually set a record that was only broken in 2006 by the Arctic Monkeys. It showcased poppy vocal melodies and harmonies, tight and well thought-out musicianship, and fantastic songwriting.', 'You can hear some edgy punk-style rhythm guitar parts, combined with clever lead parts utilizing capos and open strings that are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Marr at times. Frischman and Matthews had a great knack for playing riffs between them using slightly different rhythms, giving a really cool off-kilter sort of effect.', 'Elastica’s sound was dominated by the jangle of single-coil pickups. Frontwoman Justine Frischmann was usually seen slinging a Fender Telecaster, and you can hear that unmistakable bite in the rhythm guitar sound on songs like "2:1" and "Connection."', 'Lead guitarist Donna Matthews was normally on a Strat or Tele as well. Balancing guitars nicely with synths as Elastica did can sometimes be tricky, but playing guitars with single-coils means that there’s slightly less in the mix to compete with.', "Fender Twin amps were usually run by Frischmann, fairly clean with a Rat when needed. Matthews usually plugged into a Marshall Super Lead. Having different styles of amps also helped to differentiate and define the band's tone.", "The Manic Street Preachers were a bit of an anomaly within the genre. While they were undoubtedly part of the Britpop movement (they were one of the support acts for Oasis’ legendary 1996 Knebworth gig), they took a lot of influence from the likes of The Clash, The Sex Pistols, and Guns ’N’ Roses—particularly in the group's early days.", 'This gave them a heavier edge than most other Britpop bands and helped widen their appeal, though their capabilities as songwriters should not be understated. Their first three albums were pretty riff-laden, laced with plenty of distortion. Then, along came Everything Must Go—probably their most successful record to date, packed full of perfectly crafted Britpop masterpieces.', 'They gradually mellowed out a few albums later, but what has remained throughout the Manics’ career was James Dean Bradfield’s blistering guitar playing. Not only was JDB performing some impressive vocal acrobatics, he’d also be riffing or soloing at the same time when playing live.', 'So many of the Manics’ songs are peppered with complex chords too, adding a lot of color and musicality to their sound. This stood in contrast to a lot of other Britpop bands using standard open or barre chords. Guitar solos weren’t rare in Britpop by any means, but most of them steered towards the pentatonic scale. James Dean Bradfield, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid to show his proficiency on the instrument and break out of that box.', 'Bradfield is largely known for using a Gibson Les Paul Custom (in Alpine White, to be precise), though he’s an avid collector and uses quite a range of guitars both live and in the studio. Another guitar closely associated with the band is a Fender American Vintage ’72 Tele Thinline that used to belong to rhythm guitarist and chief lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995.', 'Bradfield also has a bunch of Gretsch guitars, most notably a G6120 that has been used on recordings and live. He’s also used Strats, Rickenbackers, and much more.', 'In terms of amps, again, he’s used quite a range. In the early days, he used a Marshall JCM900 head with a matching 4x12. Later, he used various combinations of that, a Vox AC30, an Orange combo custom-built for him by Ade Emsley and used for clean tones, a Fender Twin, and a Trace Elliot Speed King, before seemingly settling on a couple of Mesa Boogie Lone Star 2x12 combos, running through 4x12s.', "Though most members of Ash were Irish, the band did fall into the Britpop category in the late '90s. They didn’t particularly like being labelled as such, as their music did lean more into punk rock than the likes of Oasis and Pulp. That said, their combination of raucous guitars, poppy vocals, and floppy haircuts—plus the fact that they rehearsed in the same place as Pulp and Blur—rendered them perfect fodder for the final stages of Britpop.", 'The band\'s first full-length album, 1977, was raw and edgy and spawned hit singles "Girl From Mars" and "Kung Fu." For their second record, they recruited guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, and despite Nu-Clear Sounds not being quite the success they hoped for, their sound certainly opened up.', 'Following that, their third album, Free All Angels, was a huge hit and gave us singles such as "Shining Light," "There’s A Star," and a song with one of the most recognizable intros of the era—"Burn Baby Burn." By the time Free All Angels was released in 2001, the heyday of Britpop had been and gone, but the likes of Ash helped evolve guitar music into what was to come.', "Both Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley are well-known for their guitars of choice. Wheeler is rarely seen without a Gibson Flying V (his particular guitar is an ‘81 or ‘82 model), though in the early days, he was often playing a Les Paul Standard or a mid-'70s Fender Mustang.", 'Charlotte Hatherley was usually playing a cherry red Gibson SG. It looks like the guitar started out life as an SG Junior but was perhaps converted to house a humbucker pickup instead of the stock P-90. The interplay of these two humbucker-equipped guitars gave Ash a huge sound, particularly live.', 'Charlotte’s SG would normally go through an Ampeg Fallen Angel head, alongside a Fender combo that, from photos, looks to be a Fender Twin. Tim was usually seen using Mesa Boogie amps—either a Dual Rectifier or a Road King, though Marshall heads were also seen on stage early on as well.', 'John Squire’s impact on Britpop is interesting, as he was one of the key influencers on the genre to begin with. The Stone Roses put out their debut album in 1989, inspiring nearly every Britpop musician to come.', 'Their following album, Second Coming, took years to produce and was released in the same year as Oasis’ debut,Definitely Maybe, in 1994. After the group disbanded, he went on to form The Seahorses, who released one album in 1997. So, not only did Squire pave the way for Britpop, he helped shape it along the way.', "Squire is an incredible, versatile player. His work on the debut Roses albums encompasses '60s-style jangly open chords, single note riffs, Keith Richards-esque licks, and tasteful solos. As the only guitarist in the band, there was a lot of room for him to play, without clashing with anything else in the mix.", "Double-tracking was used to thicken up choruses, and acoustics were used alongside electrics for texture. Second Coming was considerably more guitar-centric and was more like a collection of jams featuring a lot of '70s classic rock-style riffs and solos. While the album is generally less acclaimed by fans than the first, the guitar work shouldn’t go unnoticed.", "The Seahorses’ one and only album was titled Do It Yourself, and that’s what Squire did. It's a record chock-full of guitar riffs and long solos. Footage from that time shows that he had an affinity for three-pickup Gibson Les Pauls and Marshall JCM900 SLX amps, as well as a half-stack that was custom-built for him by Kendrick Amps", 'With The Stone Roses, he’d often use a Fender Twin or a Mesa Boogie Mark II, though to play those classic tunes in recent years, he’s relied on Mesa Boogie Lone Stars.', "There were a few pretty key guitars as well, including a mid-'60s Gretsch Country Gent, a 1960 Fender Strat and an original ’59 Les Paul on Second Coming. There have been numerous pedals used by Squire over the years, but a Tube Screamer, an Ibanez Chorus, a Boss Flanger and a Fuzz Face are fairly closely linked to the Mancunian.", "Echobelly perfectly epitomized the middle ground of Britpop with their loud, brash, jangly guitars sat beneath poppy, hooky vocal melodies. They had a good string of albums in the '90s, with their first two enjoying chart success at the height of the Britpop movement.", 'Their tunes were catchy and upbeat, and they gained fans in the form of none other than Smiths frontman Morrissey and pop royalty Madonna. While it’s hard to imagine Echobelly without the incredible voice of lead singer Sonya Madan, the guitar interplay between Glenn Johansson and Debbie Smith really helped define their sound.', 'Super melodic clean, jangly lines would sit on top of distorted power chords to give a nice, wide sound—"Great Things" being a prime example. There are times when the guitars lean into punk, or even grunge, which acts as a really effective juxtaposition to the vocal lines.', 'The pair seemed to go down the classic humbuckers/single-coils route, with Johansson usually playing Les Pauls and Smith on Fenders—either a Mustang or a Strat. Having the different pickup types helps keep definition within the mix of the band.', 'In keeping with this, Johansson’s Les Paul looks to be going through Marshall stacks (possibly a JTM100 or 1959SLP) and Smith’s Fenders through a Fender combo—again, giving two completely different tones that compliment each other and can easily be distinguished.', 'The gear used by many of the key guitarists in Britpop shows how diverse the music actually was. Whilst you could imagine them all on at the same festival, the likes of the Manic Street Preachers were very different to Elastica, for example.', 'A common feature within Britpop was to have one guitar using single-coils with another using humbuckers to create easily distinguishable tones, or to use two humbucker-equipped guitars for a massive sound. Marshall JCM900s are fairly commonplace within Britpop, as are AC30s and Fender Twins, as well as Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls.', "Whilst Britpop may have fizzled out in the late '90s, its influence can still be heard in music today and doesn’t look to be going anywhere soon.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Each of the eight episodes chronicles an event, musical tool, group, trend, etc. that defined a moment in pop music history. Right away, I couldn\'t resist the second episode, "Auto-Tune," featuring T-Pain on the episode cover.', 'Although T-Pain did not invent Auto-Tune, nor was he even close to the first musician to have used it, Auto-Tune is undeniably what he became known for in the early 2000s. Why? Because he used the pitch-correcting software as a creative tool in itself, rather than as a corrective crutch.', '"You can write the history of electronic music as \'the creative misuse of available tools,\'" says musician and writer Jace Clayton later on in the episode. It\'s a perfectly articulated statement, but one I\'d take a few steps further.', 'The history of some of the most impactful music innovations in general have their roots in creative misuses, malfunctioning equipment, and happy accidents. A broken mixing board eventually spawned the fuzz pedal; "misusing" turntables begets DJing and early hip-hop; the result of overdriven, inefficient speakers in early tube amps becomes a must-have feature in modern gear—the list goes on.', 'Inspired by This Is Pop, we\'re going to dig into just a few examples of when using gear the "wrong" way led to the right result.', 'In the mid-\'90s, seismic data processing engineer Andy Hildebrand was at a luncheon when his colleague\'s wife, a singer, offhandedly requested that Hildebrand make her "a box that would have me sing in-tune." In 1996, Auto-Tune was born.', '"There were other attempts to do what I did," Hildebrand says in This Is Pop, "but those efforts were doomed because the practitioners didn\'t understand the issues." While the specifics of those complexities are too abstract to dive into, it comes down to the fact that Hildebrand uniquely understood the math of the problem because of his background.', 'Seismic data processing is a discipline used to locate oil by way of sound. Dynamite is detonated into the ground and geophones are used to listen to the reverberations that come back, which helps engineers determine the location of oil. "Mathematically, it\'s like going out in the rain during a thunderstorm, closing your eyes, and because of the rolling sound of the thunder, figuring out the shape of the clouds."', 'Hildebrand\'s understanding of these systems, of seismic data as sound, is what allowed him to tackle the complex problems of pitch-correction. "I knew pretty much how to do it right away, technically, because a lot of the work I had done related to those issues."', "Although Hildebrand, a non-musician, was making his Auto-Tune software to solve musicians' problems, correcting pitch is just about all he intended. In a matter of months, Auto-Tune was in almost every major studio throughout the United States and became a well-kept secret among recording engineers and musicians. It was the ultimate secret sauce, the magic wand an audio engineer could wave that turned a single take into what would've otherwise been the result of a strenuous week of sessions in the vocal booth.", 'This was such a guarded secret that two years later, when Cher\'s slightly Auto-Tuned single "Believe" rose to the top of the charts and everyone clambered to find out what effect had been used, her producers lied, claiming that they\'d achieved the sound with a vocoder.', 'In reality, it was the "retune" dial within the Auto-Tune software that essentially acts as a speed control. Turn it down to slow the speed of your pitch change, up to quicken it, or down to zero for instantaneous pitch changes, which is where the "Believe" magic happens. "With Auto-Tune," says Clayton, "it becomes creative precisely at the moment when producers stop using it the way it was intended."', 'A few years later, T-Pain exploited that single speed control more purposely and persistently than any other artist had up to that point. It became his signature vocal sound and, eventually, was a style that other major artists and rappers started to use with the same regularity. Designed as a tool to help correct the flaws of human pitch, Auto-Tune became an instrument used to manipulate vocals into something not quite human at all—a sound unique to the software that created it. "Auto-Tune became creative,"', 'While we place the dawn of the vocoder in electronic music in the 1970s with pioneers like Bob Moog, Wendy Carlos, and Herbie Hancock, the actual vocoder itself had been invented almost four decades earlier, in 1938. Bell Labs engineer Homer Dudley was responsible, and the original goal was to synthesize human speech to reduce the bandwidth of radio transmissions.', 'While it did successfully serve that purpose, it became particularly useful within a decade of its invention for its encryption security. Vocoding a radio transmission made it much more difficult to intercept, and the vocoder technology was used extensively throughout World War II. In fact, the NSA continues to use vocoder technology in some of its encryption systems even today.', "It wasn't until the late-'50s that the first real attempt was made to use a vocoder in musical applications. In 1959, the Siemens Synthesizer was developed at the Siemens Studio for Electronic Music in Germany to make electronic music for their own films. It functioned similarly to the RCA Synthesizer but also featured a built-in vocoder. Still, it would be several years before the vocoder became popular, or even just widely recognized.", "Bob Moog built his first solid-state musical vocoder in 1968 for the electronic music studio at the University of Buffalo, but his second go of it in 1970 is what put vocoders on the map. In partnership with Wendy Carlos, Moog built a 10-band vocoder device directly inspired by Dudley's original designs. Carlos then used the system on the soundtrack to Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film A Clockwork Orange, introducing it to the world.", "Suzanne Ciani was another early pioneer of the vocoder in electronic music applications. While working toward a master's degree in composition at UC-Berkeley in the late '60s, Ciani met Don Buchla and was immediately taken with the Buchla synth. She began working for Buchla and Associates after graduation, bought her own Buchla 200, and began making her own records and composing professionally.", 'One of her commissions was to make the sounds for the pinball game Xenon in 1979, for which she used her own voice through a vocoder. This was the first female voice to ever be heard in a pinball game, and her work earned her induction into The Pinball Expo Hall of Fame in 2013.', "The following year, in 1980, Ciani also appeared on The David Letterman Show and on PBS's 3-2-1 Contact to demonstrate her synthesizer and the use of a vocoder specifically. Letterman characteristically plays the curmudgeon, but little can detract from watching and listening to Ciani.", "In the following decades, vocoders have become common features of modern synths of all sizes, with Korg's microKorg series being an excellent example of both compact size and affordable price.", "It's common knowledge that guitar amplifiers had been invented and were on the market for roughly two decades before Leo Fender unveiled his narrow-panel tweed amps in the 1950s. However, it's also common knowledge that those '50s Fenders undeniably changed and shaped the amp market forever.", "Immediately upon their release—and even today, if you can find a later-'50s original in good condition—the Fender tweed amps skyrocketed in popularity for their ability to produce beautiful, amplified clean tones, suitable for any genre, the second you plugged in.", 'While these beautiful and crisp cleans were what these tube amps were intended to produce, blues players began to exploit some of the amps\' "flaws" to stunning and ground-breaking degrees. Because these original amplifiers were low-fidelity with inefficient speakers, cranking up the gain would produce that excellent, overdriven distortion that we commonly call "breakup."', 'Famous early examples can be heard on tracks like Chuck Berry\'s 1955 hit "Maybellene," which features an overdriven solo produced by his small valve amplifier. Howlin\' Wolf\'s guitarist, Willie Johnson, and bluesman Pat Hare also began dialing up the gain to emulate this kind of distortion.', 'This fuzzy, overdriven sound could also be achieved if the amp was slightly damaged, which most of the early players figured out accidentally. Perhaps the first and certainly one of the most famous examples can be heard on Ike Turner\'s 1951 single "Rocket 88." One of the speaker cones of guitarist Willie Kizart\'s vacuum tube amplifier had been damaged in transport, and he used it to record the track anyway.', 'Similarly, after playing a live performance with a damaged amp, guitarist Paul Burlison of the Johnny Burnette Trio got such rave reviews for his amp\'s overdriven sound that he subsequently decided to purposely dislodge one of his vacuum tubes for the 1956 recording of "The Train Kept A-Rollin."', 'People loved the unique, "incorrect" sound so much that guitarists started intentionally damaging their equipment to try and achieve the fuzzy tone themselves. Link Wray is another late-\'50s example, known for going beyond simply messing with his vacuum tubes—he actually jammed pencils into his speaker cones for even more dirt.', 'This, of course, was well before the age of effects pedals, and in fact was one of the inciting moments that would lead to their eventual creation (along with another gear malfunction happy accident). But more than that, it redefined what electric guitar players wanted and expected from their amplifiers. The thing that "wasn\'t supposed to happen" turned into one of the key features that defined that amps themselves and eventually helped birth rock \'n\' roll.', 'There are countless other examples of this "innovation by accident"—lots of other notable instances of musicians taking technology and using it outside of its original intention. And really, what is more creative than using what you have to do something brand-new? As Suzanne Ciani aptly explained in her 3-2-1 Contact special, "Part of an instrument is what it can do, and part of it is what you do to it."', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Slim hexagonal pads triggering electronic sounds replaced the traditional drum kit, creating an iconic, futuristic image and an ultra-modern sound that dominated MTV and radio throughout the '80s.", "The roll call of the '80s Simmons acolytes is endless. Pop sensations like Spandau Ballet, Duran Duran, Culture Club, and INXS; rock 'n' roll dragon-slayers Van Halen, Def Leppard, and Rush; R&B stars like Cameo and Klymaxx; reggae legend Sly Dunbar are among the legions who embraced the SDSV to bring the beat that defined the times.", 'Forty years after the revolution began, Dr. Burgess fills us in on how it all went down.', 'In the \'70s, searching for an acceptable electronic rhythm source was more difficult than purchasing a parka in the Sahara. For most of the decade, the best you could do was buy an early drum machine box like the Ace Tone Rhythm Ace, which seemed like it had been pulled out of a department store organ and permanently set on "foxtrot." Even the more sophisticated drum machines that began to arrive at decade\'s end, like the Roland CompuRhythm, were rudimentary.', 'And if you wanted to actually hit the electronic percussion with a drumstick, options were even more limited. There was the Impakt Percussion Synthesizer, which looked a mix between a blender and a frying pan. There was the Synare Drum Synth, suggestive of a drum stool that had transformed into a flying saucer. And there was the Pollard Syndrum, which provided the distinctive descending bloop on disco records like Anita Ward\'s "Ring My Bell" and snuck into occasional pop smashes like Gerry Rafferty\'s "Baker Street."', "But these were electronic drum pads one would turn to for an extra splash of color here and there, nothing that could fill the role of an actual drum kit. Even when St. Albans-based company Musicaid released its Simmons SD-3 in 1979, the work of wily young British engineer Dave Simmons, it was still worlds away from anything you'd call a drum kit—simply two pairs of rototom-style drum pads connected to an electronic brain.", "That's where Burgess enters the picture. A forward-thinking drummer then finding grassroots success with jazz-rock group Landscape, he had tried all the other electro-percussive instruments available before the SDS-3's arrival. Landscape saxophonist John Walters was playing a Lyrcion Wind Synth at the time, which was distributed by Musicaid, creating the fateful connection that brought Burgess into Simmons' orbit and set the stage for innovation that would have a lasting impact on music technology", '"Recorded drums are really an electronic artifact," Burgess declares. "The instrument being played may have been acoustic but the trend since the early \'60s had been towards close mic\'ing and heavy electronic treatment such as compression, gating, and equalization. The sound that we hear on those records is not much like the sound you hear when you play acoustic drums.... It occurred to me that it would be game-changing to have an instrument that would spit out a [drum] sound with the impact of the recorded sound I heard when I went into the control room for playback."', 'Having played all the earlier electronic drums, Burgess had honed in on what was missing. "None of them really emulated or performed the function of acoustic percussion or drums because they lacked the rise time speed in their voltage-controlled amplifiers, which would impart the instant attack that is characteristic of most percussion instruments. They either had a soft attack or a delayed response, which was disconcerting if you were trying to play them in a live situation."', 'Before joining forces with Simmons, Burgess had contacted Syndrum creator Joe Pollard to offer his thoughts on improving the instrument by adding attack at the start of the signal. "He took exception to any suggestion that the Syndrum was less than perfect," says Burgess drolly, "and it was not a successful call."', 'It was while working live with the SDS-3 and its little sibling the SDS-IV that Burgess had a breakthrough.', '"I triggered them from my live drum set using crystal mics that I bought for 20p from a local electronic shop," he explains. "The system worked really well and for some time [Landscape] toured with the drums being augmented with the triggered electronic sounds of the SDS synths. Effectively, I was using the acoustic drum sound for the attack component and the synthesized sound to augment the tone of the instrument. I figured out that it was possible to combine the sounds from multiple modules of the SDS-3s and -IVs that I had."', 'At the same time, Burgess began thinking about a full-fledged electronic drum kit:', '', '', '', 'Burgess replicated these sounds on different SDS modules and triggered them simultaneously from a simple trigger pad. "I was pretty excited about it," he says of his eureka moment. "The sound coming out of them did what drums are supposed to do–the bass drum sound kicked me in the stomach and moved my rib cage, and the snare was like an axe through my head. Perfect."', 'Burgess excitedly took the long trek from London to share his findings with Simmons. "We both realized we were on to something," he says. "He started working on putting something together that would be a compact, single-purpose percussion device but that would be capable of performing the various functions of the drum set."', 'As a New Zealand native, Burgess had studied electronics and engineering at Christchurch Polytechnic, and had subsequently gotten his hands dirty finding DIY solutions for electronic issues he encountered as a professional musician. His tech background and drumming experience made him the ideal partner for Simmons.', '"Dave put the electronics together," says Burgess, "he was technically very savvy, and it was what he did every day. My technical expertise was useful in knowing what was possible and what was not and in making suggestions."', 'Burgess\' ideas were partly informed by a dissatisfaction at having the drums fight for a place in the live mix against instruments that could go directly through the P.A. "It came about from many conversations on the road with Landscape about why drums were still in the stone age, and all the other instruments were post-Edison technology," he explains.', 'The memory buttons on the front of the SDSV were inspired by Burgess\' performance needs too. "[They were] something I wanted for live shows so you could have the front controls and four presets that I could set up before the show, and that would retain the sounds from show to show," he says. "Being able to change sounds from song to song was a completely new concept for drummers."', 'Even the default sound of the SDSV\'s toms, with the drop-off in pitch you\'ve heard on a million recordings, was based on Burgess\' Pearl concert tom setup. "I tuned the toms with one screw loose and that caused the pitch to drop after the initial attack," he says. "To some extent that happens when you hit a drumhead... Having a loose tension rod accentuates that effect."', 'Simmons and Burgess also put their heads together to create the iconic look of the SDSV\'s drum pads in all their hexagonal glory, though there were some surprising detours along the way. "We had discussed that the pads didn\'t need to be round or even have tensioned drumheads since they were not producing any sound," recalls Burgess. "The next time I went up there he had made a triangular pad with riot shield material as the striking surface."', "In the experimental phase, Simmons tried out everything from batwing-shaped drums to rather creepy head-shaped drums that looked like they'd come off a totem pole.", '"It struck me that the honeycomb would be a great shape because it was ergonomic," says Burgess. "The hex shapes all fit together easily, making it easy to set a kit up in various ways to suit different players. That\'s where the hexagonal shape came from. At that time, we didn\'t know that the whole synthetic drum idea would catch on, and we certainly didn\'t know that it would be the hex shape that would become the dominant shape and the brand image."', 'Ultimately, Simmons created a prototype for the SDSV\'s electronic brain by assembling the necessary components on circuit boards mounted to a piece of wood. By this time, Landscape had evolved into synth-pop pioneers and Burgess had begun a parallel career as a producer. The prototype was inaugurated on Landscape\'s second album, From the Tea-rooms of Mars…, and on his production of the 1980 single "Angel Face / R.E.R.B." by electro-dance troupe Shock, a key record in the early development of the New Romantic movement.', 'The SDSV went into production in 1981, by which point MusicAid had gone belly-up, and Simmons started the company that bore his name. Burgess\' growing renown as a producer and—with the ascent of Landscape\'s "Einstein A Go-Go" to the U.K. Top 5—a pop star, he was offered plenty of opportunities to boost the new instrument\'s profile.', 'Landscape had already demonstrated the prototype in a November 1979 performance for BBC TV\'s futurist-tech showcase Tomorrow\'s World. When "Einstein A Go-Go" hit, the band\'s video for the song featured Burgess (who\'s also the lead singer) playing the creepy-heads version of the kit. And when Landscape appeared on Top of the Pops, the SDSV got another national outing.', "Between his involvement with the aforementioned Shock and rising stars Spandau Ballet and Visage, Burgess was a prime mover in the burgeoning New Romantic scene. He'd already produced Journeys to Glory, the album that put Spandau on the map. For their follow-up, Diamond, Burgess made them the first band to hit the charts with the production model of the SDSV.", '"I had John Keeble play SDSV with the hex pads on Spandau Ballet\'s first single from their second album, \'Chant No. 1,\'" remembers Burgess. "Spandau then used the pads live on TOTP. From all of this the SDSV Hex pads became the house kit on TOTP, and they went viral."', 'In short order, Simmons kits achieved the ubiquity of lightsabers at a Star Wars convention. For the rest of the decade, the SDSV and its subsequent iterations were all over MTV, radio, and concert stages. If you wanted to be hip, you needed a hexagonal drum kit with that Simmons sound. "Having nurtured this idea over several years it was mind-boggling how it took off and how immediate the demand was," confesses Burgess.', "The new generation of synth-friendly pop stars emerging in England at the start of the '80s were a natural fit for the au courant look and sound of Simmons drums. The instrument became a must for every self-respecting denizen of the U.K. Top 40, from Duran Duran and Culture Club to ABC and Ultravox.", "But the Simmons sphere of influence extended far beyond British borders. Not only did the sounds supply the modern touch needed for genre-bending visionaries like Prince, they worked their way into the worlds of forward-looking R&B acts like The Jacksons, Cameo, Zapp, Klymaxx, and loads of others. Simmons kits also entered the hands of jazz-schooled, chops-heavy hands of players like Dave Weckl (Chick Corea Elektric Band) and Chad Wackerman (Frank Zappa). King Crimson's Bill Bruford literally became the Simmons poster boy, demonstrating the instrument on TV and taking it further as a stylist in a concert setting than just about anybody.", 'Bands on the more tech-savvy end of the hard-rock spectrum boarded the Simmons train with gusto. Van Halen\'s "Jump" and "Hot for Teacher" and Rush\'s "Distant Early Warning" are only a few of the notable rock songs of the era that feature Simmons e-drums (alongside acoustic drums and standard cymbals). And of course, after Def Leppard drummer Rick Allen\'s infamous 1984 accident cost him an arm, Simmons raced to the rescue with a custom-designed kit that enabled Allen to drive his band on monster hits like "Pour Some Sugar on Me."', 'By the time renowned session musicians like Jeff Porcaro and John "J.R." Robinson sunk their teeth into the technology, you could scarcely turn a corner without tripping over a Simmons kit. It was turning up on \'80s tracks by everybody from pop/R&B songbirds Stephanie Mills and Patti Austin to jazz-pop MOR icons Manhattan Transfer.', "The rest of the music gear industry paid plenty of attention to the Simmons explosion in the '80s. Drum companies and electronics specialists alike set their teams to work on getting a piece of the action, whether through their own variations on the kits or by snagging the sounds for sampling.", '"Almost immediately the Simmons sound was digitized," recalls Burgess, "and you could buy Simmons sound chips for the new digital drum machines and the basic sounds were being swapped around for the digital samplers and the sampling drum machines."', "In 1983 MPC Electronics came out with their Music Percussion Computer, featuring eight pads in a tabletop format not far removed from Simmons' 1981 Suitcase Kit (which was sort of a portable SDSV). MPC eventually created their own full-on SDSV-style kit, buoyed by the endorsement of drum deity Bernard Purdie himself. Around 1986 even instrument manufacturers in the USSR got their licks in, with Formanta's undeniably Simmons-esque Rokton UDS kit. Yamaha had an '80s four-pad variation on the Suitcase format too, with their DD5. Roland doubled that with their 1985 Octapad, and the same year they strode into Simmons-territory with their Alpha Drum System, its hexagonal pads looking uncannily familiar.", "By the time the '90s rolled around, e-drum kits had fallen out of favor. Players were either looking once again to acoustic sources for their beats or focusing on MIDI triggers and the drum machines developed in parallel to Simmons kits. Simmons' company hung it up at the end of the '90s, having long since shifted its business away from drum kits.", "Some diehards still kept the faith. In 1992, Roland introduced the TD-7, the first kit in its V-Drum line. But it was probably still a lonely time to be an electronic drummer. Something funny happened around the turn of the millennium, though. E-drum kits started seeming cool again. Yamaha unveiled its DTX series in 2000, and Roland—who had never given up on their V-Drums—introduced their TD series a few years later, a line that's still going strong today.", "Along the way, sampling pads like Roland's SPD family went through the roof. Today there are tons of quality, affordable e-drum kits coming from the likes of Donner, Kat, and Alesis, and even hybrid acoustic/electronic kits like the Pearl e/Merge. Even Dave Simmons eventually got back in the business, though his kits have long abandoned the classic SDSV design.", 'Looking back at what his and Simmons\' ideas have wrought, Burgess reckons, "I have to imagine that drum synthesizers would have happened eventually [anyway], but the SDSV definitely established a level of viability and interest as the first drum synthesizer that could perform the function of acoustic drums. I feel sure its presence sped up the process."', 'Assessing subsequent e-drum evolutions, Burgess says, "It\'s impossible to imagine that the SDSV was not the benchmark for the next generation of drum synthesizers that came out. I have to say that the new Roland electronic drums are very good. I have the top-of-the-line set and it does a great deal of what I hoped the SDSV would develop into."', 'Burgess has always been a bit ahead of the curve; forecasting the future, he says, "The final frontier may well be the one I was originally trying to solve—of making the live performance capabilities as or more versatile than the best acoustic instruments. I was trained in jazz and classical music and the test for me has always been whether an electronic set can respond as sensitively and in as many varied ways as a top-of-the-line acoustic set. Sounding like an acoustic set was never important to me. That\'s very easy to achieve today with digital sounds."', 'Sounding like an acoustic set was clearly never on the agenda with the SDSV. If it were, an armada of classic tunes would have sounded very different. When Duran drummer Roger Taylor says the Simmons kit "defined the drum sound for the \'80s," well, he ought to know.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

In the first half, Nelson speaks with Gary Noble about Amy Winehouse's debut, Frank, and in the next, he talks to Salaam Remi about her enduring hit Back to Black.", 'Remi was also kind enough to let us publish a photograph from the sessions.', 'Sometimes the biggest shifts start with the most humble beginnings.', "Three-time Grammy Award–winning engineer Gary Noble met an unassuming 18-year-old Amy Winehouse in 2002 when she arrived at producer Salaam Remi's production studio off of Biscayne and 15th Street in downtown Miami with just her manager. He remembers the precocious singer arriving at the studio with a knapsack on one shoulder and a guitar case on the other. After exchanging introductions, Remi and Noble wanted to hear what she had to offer. The rest is history.", '"I thought she was going to pull out a CD or something. Instead, she got up, opened up the guitar case, took the guitar out, sat down, tuned the guitar in front of us, and then started playing the song on the guitar and singing. His and our eyes made contact and it was like, \'Dude, we have to work with her,\'" Noble says.', "This started a relationship that would result in the making of her debut album, Frank, the world's first full-length introduction to the sorceress of sorrow. Chatting with Reverb, Noble discusses why Pro Tools wasn't good enough during the Frank sessions, Winehouse's curious creative mind, and his last memories of the creative genius.", "For the Frank sessions, Noble remembers Winehouse being recorded on Digital Performer using a Neumann U 47 mic going into an Avalon VT-737sp Tube Channel Strip with very light compression and basically no EQ. For mixing Winehouse's smoky and enveloping vocals, Noble used the Neve 33609/N Stereo Compressor and Avalon AD2055 Equalizer before ending off with a bit of LA-2A, which added a bit of smoothness and warmth to the vocals. Noble now uses Pro Tools HD daily to record artists because of its improved automatic delay compensation, but back in the early 2000s, the DAW that would become industry standard was lacking.", '"At that time, Pro Tools was still TDM [Time Division Multiplexing], and to us, it didn\'t sound as good as Digital Performer. Plus, you had to buy the Pro Tools/TDM rig, which was like 70 grand, just to be able to use Pro Tools. It\'s not like now where you can buy Pro Tools software and run it on anything."', "Winehouse was the driving force for Frank, Noble was the facilitator of her vision, but Noble remembers Remi setting the tone and direction of Frank's production. It's Remi who brought the Yamaha DM-2000 Digital Console to the sessions in order for them to switch between projects at will, a capability impossible on an analog console. It was Remi who wanted everything to sound live. It's also Remi who possibly imbued Frank with the spirit of the great Frank Sinatra.", "Before the Frank sessions, Remi purchased New York City recording studio Soundworks with a U 47 mic in a mic closet leftover from the previous iteration of the studio space, and one possibly used by the great Frank Sinattra. Noble says Remi refurbished the vintage mic to its original factory specs to get it as close as possible to Sinatra's timeless sound.", 'Frank was, in part, destined to be a classic from its inception. "It enhanced her voice more. Some people may not like it because they said it brought up her midrange," Noble says. "But, to me, that\'s what made her special. It brought out the natural resonance of her voice. That\'s what people liked about her."', "Noble remembers a typical session involving Remi making a rough drum track on the MPC whenever Winehouse was beginning to write songs, in order to keep the timing of the song in creation. When she was ready, Winehouse would go in the booth and play guitar and sing simultaneously. That was intentional on Remi's part. He wanted the end result of her recording to sound natural—not pieced together one vocal take at a time. All of the music on Frank came from live instrumentation; nothing was quantized, everything was natural.", '"When we were mixing it, there was no Auto-Tune on her. We wanted it to be her natural essence and she was very conscious of her pitch and was already on point where to enunciate and emote more. She really knew how to work the microphone to the benefit of the song," Noble says. "Even though it was a record, we wanted it to feel live. Salaam was very adamant that it always felt live. It needed to feel like she was performing somewhere when we recorded it and when we mixed the recording. That\'s how we wanted it to feel."', "As far as Winehouse's recording, the Grammy Award–winning singer did no more than three takes for vocals for each song and never punched in. Noble would simply go to the top of the song, press record, and let her perform the song in its entirety. Every time you hear her voice on Frank, it is one stream of consciousness captured in that moment of time, polished later by Remi and Noble. That sort of recording style with an artist as unapologetically open as Winehouse results in lyrics being sung that even industry veterans like Remi and Noble couldn't see coming.", '"I would press the talkback button-like, \'Amy, repeat that. What\'s that line?\' And then we\'d all look at each other and start cracking up. She was very witty and had ways of saying things where if you were paying attention you\'d go, \'Wow! She just said that?\'"', 'Winehouse\'s lasting legacy is those lyrics; words arranged perfectly to tap into the hearts of millions. Her "Stronger Than Me" song from Frank unabashedly delves into her dissatisfaction with her boyfriend leaving her in control of every aspect of their relationship. Noble remembers how touching that session was to work. "It was a good session. It was a little emotional for her because a lot of those songs are about her ex-boyfriend. I like the fact it was triumphant at the same time as she came from feeling low and was able to lift herself out of it. Music for her was like therapy."', 'Noble attests Winehouse was more interested in instruments than recording gear, evidenced by how drawn she was to the Wurlitzer electric piano during the making of Frank. "When she was writing the songs, whether starting from scratch or finishing the songs, she would either use an acoustic guitar or a Wurlitzer. She\'d be playing, figuring out a song, and come in the room like, \'I\'m trying to figure out this part. Which chord you think works better?\' She\'d play the chord progression, and then with the last chord she\'d ask, \'Should I go with that one?\'"', "One particular recording session that exemplifies the curious nature of Winehouse's creativity sticks out in Noble's mind nearly 20 years later. One day, Winehouse was in the studio's lounge after getting done with recording vocals while Remi and Noble were working on a track she had recorded vocals for soon before. They wanted her to relax her voice, which she did. But, soon they started hearing trumpet notes faintly emanating from outside of the studio.", "The sounds were coming from Winehouse trying to learn how to play the trumpet of Bruce Purse, a musician who is credited with playing trumpet on six of Frank's tracks, along with Faith Evans' 1995 debut album, Faith, and other great sessions. Winehouse may have been relaxing her voice from being a conduit for her thoughts, but that didn't mean she quieted her creative mind.", "Winehouse transitioned on July 23, 2011, three months shy of the eighth anniversary of Frank's release, taking her voice and views of the human condition from us mortals on Earth. Before Noble would never see her again, let alone work on another song together, his last memory is the same as his first: a woman with unbridled excitement to share her life with the world, one lyric at a time.", '"A year before she passed away she showed me her notebooks. She had three notebooks filled with lyrics for songs. I was excited because she was writing again. Every time we spoke about the music she got bright-eyed like when we first started working with her."', 'Few people are as intimately connected with the making of the legend that is Amy Winehouse than legendary producer Salaam Remi. After producing timeless records from The Fugees ("Fu-Ge-La"), Nas ("Made You Look" and "I Can") and others, the Grammy Award–winning producer connected with the London-born singer at his Miami production studio in 2003 to help shape her debut to the world. Salaam and Winehouse developed the sort of inseparable bond from those Frank sessions that led to a unique sound and trust. With music as personal as Winehouse\'s, trust with handling it with care is paramount.', '"Being that I produced the majority of the Frank album, and Amy had a certain trust with me, she wasn\'t really getting a lot of work done in London. So when they asked her, "Well, who do you want to go work with?" She said, "I want to go to Miami with Salaam."', 'Back to Black actually began before Frank was finished. Remi remembers early songs, which would later become "Just Friends" and "Addicted," were recorded at the end of the Frank sessions during the fall of 2003. Speaking with Reverb, Remi discusses still having the equipment from the Back to Black sessions in his home, Winehouse choosing his living room as her recording space, and the genius of her creative process.', "The writing and recording of the bulk of Winehouse and Remi's timeless work together on Back to Black were the results of roughly four two-week trips in Miami over the course of 2005 into early 2006. Remi remembers the initial tracks for Back to Black had a jazzier sound than the final product. That was the result of a pure music lover's heart getting acquainted with the sounds of the past.", '"While she was in Miami, we went to a record store, and then she bought a bunch of records. Then she\'s like, \'This is what I\'m listening to now.\' There was The Shangri-Las, Paul Anka, and more doo-wop material like The Moonglows and The \'5\' Royales. She was like, \'This is where I want to go, go with it.\'"', "Remi's downtown Miami production studio was the home of Winehouse's Frank recording in 2003. When they reconvened in 2005 to begin work on songs that would become part of Back to Black, Winehouse found herself in the middle of the living room of Remi's South Miami house. It was there that she found Back to Black's home.", '"With the Back To Black album, she stood in the middle of my living room and said, \'I want to record right here. I like the way my voice sounds standing in the middle of the space.\' It was a brand new house with a two-story ceiling. I just put a kit in the room, I just bought a piano. I put all the amps in the room and then we recorded in that room and that became sonic of many of the songs you can hear."', 'He transformed his living room into a creative playground. He had a Yamaha baby grand piano, Ampeg B-15 amp, and Fender-made Music Man amp with Winehouse\'s melancholic vocals recorded on a Neumann U 47 into an Avalon 737. When you hear [snares] that\'s from a Premier snare Remi calls "used at that time that became his go-to snare until this day." Every one of the songs he produced on Back to Black used that snare, except "Just Friends," which used piccolo snare to achieve the song\'s reggae feel.', 'His living room was also equipped with a Pacific CX Series drum kit, which Remi used to play drums on everything he produced on Back to Black—with the help of Troy Auxilly-Wilson who added drumming on "Tears Dry on The Own" and "Just Friends"—and a C3 Organ with the Leslie speaker cabinet along with bass guitars from Berkeley, California guitar shop Subway Guitars.', "The guitars came from Remi's time recording Carlos Santana in 2000, when he purchased a few custom Hofner-style violin bass guitars from Subway Guitar's owner Fatdog that would later be used on Back to Black. Jim Gaines was the engineer during those Santana sessions and taught Remi a trick that would later help shape Winehouse's magnum opus.", '"Jim Gaines, the engineer, told me that they put an 87 in between the hi-hat and the snare. So that\'s what I would do. I would use the U 87 on a snare. And to this day on all my drums, it does that."', 'As far as recording software, Digidesign Digi 002 rack audio interface in conjunction with a MacBook running Digital Performer. He also used a Neve 1077 Mic Pre/EQ during the Back to Black sessions that could\'ve been yours. "I actually put them on sale on Reverb one time, but I didn\'t say that I recorded Amy Winehouse on them." Remi is able to recall the equipment used nearly 15 years ago because he\'s never moved it from his living room since Winehouse stepped foot into work on Back to Black.', "Remi made sure every song he worked on was fully live instrumentation with no computer programming involved. He wanted to capture Winehouse's engrossing voice in its fully natural state. So, the Neumann U 47 was perfect for just that.", '"What I always loved about the U47 is that I felt like for people that have big voices, it captured from the center of their chest to both of their shoulders to the top of the head. It didn\'t just capture what was right at the mic. When I have the 67, it gets closer than the 87, more right on the point, but I felt like it captured all that room around them, which gave you enough room to hear their vocal ability and more space around it, not just their vocal by itself. So when I was recording her vocals into that, you were able to hear her vocal ability and not just that little piece."', 'As far as Winehouse\'s writing process, Remi remembers she would always write the songs over rough skeleton tracks. She would write for half the week and cut the vocal in one or two takes from top to bottom. The writing on Back to Black feels like diary entries unlocked from Winehouse\'s heart and her writing process mirrored that private freedom. "She\'d be sitting outside a lot of times writing. Sitting in my garden, sitting on the back porch, cooking. She cleaned up my house one day. She would do all types of other stuff."', 'Winehouse trusted Remi to bring her creative vision to life after she recorded her vocals and left the songs with him. "She knew that I was always going to do the right thing as far as arranging sort of vocals. So she didn\'t really go too far with that stuff as far as getting into whatever my decision was. Only she says, \'I don\'t like strings, I don\'t want strings.\'"', 'From there, he would record the live instrumentation of each part of each one of his productions in order to be able to manipulate them as he wanted because outside of the skeletal beat. John Adams played organ and Rhodes on "Unholy War" and "Just Friends," and Vincent Henry played guitar on "Just Friends." It was a collaborative effort even when everyone wasn\'t in the same room.', '"Sometimes my musicians playing the horns weren\'t in Miami. So what I would do is I\'d be working on a track and I would send them like hummed references and different things. And at that time, we would use an iDisk. So he would take it and put it on the Apple iDisk. I put an MP3 up and then call him and say, "This is what I\'m going to do, and this is what the tempo is." And then they would load it into whatever they were working on And they sent it back to me on the Apple iDisk. So that\'s how that was going down."', 'Countless people have had tears ripped from their eyes by Winehouse\'s immersively depressing tunes, but Remi remembers Winehouse wasn\'t emotional while they were recording Back to Black because "our recording space was a safe space and no one was around." One song that did elicit a grim emotional reaction from Winehouse was a slow version of "Unholy War" that never made the album. At the time, Remi thought the track was "the best record I had ever made in my entire life." Unfortunately, for Winehouse, it was too much to bear.', '"When she listened to it, she said it sounds like I\'m dying. And she took it off the album. And I was gutted, I couldn\'t believe that the best record I\'d ever made wasn\'t on Back to Black. I was gutted, it was almost like it was too real."', 'Finer Notes is a new series that looks into the equipment, techniques, and untold stories that went into shaping classic albums, where engineers and producers discuss how they used the equipment of the time to make a body of work that’s timeless.', "About the author: Keith Nelson Jr is a seasoned music journalist who followed his innate passion for knowledge to interview some of the most influential figures in the music industry.

That is, she flips a right-handed guitar and plays it without changing the position of the strings.', 'With her high E on top and low E on bottom, Moye blazes up and down the fretboard like a firebrand, each lick a topsy-turvy version of standard guitar-playing.', 'While she has a sound all her own, Moye is part of a tradition of upside-down guitarists, dating back to folk blues and continuing through the present day.', 'In our video above, she talks through six other upside-down greats.', "Visit Malina Moye's website to learn more about her and keep up to date with her work. Or grab a set of her brand-new Dean Markley Malina Moye Artist Series strings.", 'Elizabeth Cotten, who was born in 1893, played music from an early age, fingerpicking with her left hand on right-handed banjos and guitars. By the age of 12, she had written "Freight Train," one of her most enduring songs. But the wider world wouldn\'t hear it until the roots music revival of the 1950s, when Cotten\'s recording and performing career began in full.', 'As a self-taught blues-folk musician, she approached her upside-down guitar-playing in her own unique way, using her fingers to pluck the bass strings while her thumb picked out the melody.', "When Albert King was still an up-and-coming bluesman in the '50s, he falsely told promoters and audiences that he was B.B. King's brother. While that may have helped land some early gigs, Albert's personal style definitely set him apart.", "Albert was a heavy-handed player, using his thumb to pluck notes with a percussive pop and aggressively bending strings during his solos. At times, he'd bend and drag two notes at once or bend a single note two whole steps above its original position. And remember—by doing this on an upside-down guitar—he was usually bending strings down, in the opposite direction of a standard player.", 'Another king, "The King of the Surf Guitar," was another heavy-handed upside-down guitarist. Dick Dale\'s playing style—as heard on "Misirlou"—combined the Middle Eastern scales of his Lebanese heritage with the reverb-drenched, overdriven sound of cranked Fender amps (which he often blew up at gigs).', "Dale's aggressive tremolo picking later influenced the quick attack of metal guitarists, and his over-the-neck fingering was a move later borrowed by Jimi Hendrix.", 'Unlike many upside-down players, Dale often used a left-handed guitar, so the angled bridge pickup of his Stratocaster gave his bass strings extra high-end bite.', 'Otis Rush introduced "I Can\'t Quit You Baby" to the world. Written by Willie Dixon, Rush first recorded the song in 1956 and made it an instant hit, more than a decade before Led Zeppelin super-charged it on their 1969 debut.', "Rush's intense playing was often done on a Gibson ES-355 or 345—not particularly common choices for upside-down guitarists. And his slow, controlled vibrato is almost unmatched.", 'Rush credited he upside-down nature of his guitar with some of his signature tone, telling Vintage Guitar magazine: "It\'s a lot less stress to tear a house down than to build it up, right? Pulling down makes more sense, to me anyway, and I can work it stronger and get it to sustain better. \'Course, besides all that, I kinda like doing things backwards, anyway."', "Doyle Bramhall II may be one of the most-recognized upside-down guitarists playing today, having performed alongside Eric Clapton and Roger Waters for years. But along with his solo work, he's also played with the likes of Allen Toussaint, Dr. John, Elton John & Leon Russell, and more heavyweights.", 'Like other upside-down players, Bramhall is self-taught. He has said he learned about 100 songs before his first proper lesson, so when the teacher told him he ought to restring his guitar correctly, it was already too late.', "Rounding out our list is another incredible blues guitarist still making music today. Eric Gales' solos can have a cutting bite—bright, clear, and pointed. But he can also be sweet and nuanced.", "Like so many other upside-down players, Gales got started on right-handed guitars because that's simply what was most available. But what's really interesting about Gales is that he kept it up long after he had the choice.", "Gales, whose nickname is Raw Dawg, now has his own signature model: the Magneto Sonnet Raw Dawg. But in keeping with tradition, this Strat-style guitar is still built for right-handers, with Gale choosing to play his own signature guitar upside-down.

For those who knew him, it must have seemed a logical next step when he launched Reverend Guitars in the late '90s. Joe had played guitar since he was 19, studied at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo for a degree in industrial design, and taken an intensive course in guitar making at the specialist Roberto-Venn School of Luthiery in Phoenix, Arizona.", 'After that, he returned to Kalamazoo and started making carved-top solidbodies. "I thought I was going to be this guy who sits in his basement and builds extremely expensive guitars, one every six months or so, and charges outrageous amounts of money for them," he recalls. "But as honorable as that sounds, I soon realized that was more work than I bargained on. I thought, There\'s got to be easier ways to make money in this business."', 'Joe turned to repair work, found he enjoyed it, and started to trade in used guitars as well. "Doing repair and buying and selling used instruments is really an education itself, which you really should be doing before you\'re building guitars. I kind of approached it backwards at first. Dealing with all these older guitars forces you to study what came before. And also it forces you to interact with the customers—and they\'ll certainly tell you what they want or don\'t want. It all makes for a good foundation to then design and build your own guitars."', "First came marriage, a move to the Detroit area, and his store, Joe's Guitar Exchange & Repair. That lasted about a year, until Joe started to wonder about manufacturing. He launched J.F. Naylor Engineering speakers, and then around 1994, he converted the store and started Naylor Amplifiers.", '"We were one of the first if not the first to do a Marshall-style boutique hand-wired amplifier, the Naylor Super-Drive Sixty," he says. "The guy who did the amp repair for us when I had the store was Danny Russell, a Marshall amp expert and to this day one of the best amp techs that I know of. So we collaborated, and that\'s how we came up with the Naylor amplifier. But I think the market was more confused than anything," Joe adds with a laugh, "it was like: \'How come this is $1,400?\' We did OK, though, and it resonated with a few high-profile players, like Ron Asheton, George Lynch, Steve Stevens, Kenny Olson, Joey Mazzola and Mike Cross of Sponge, and Jag Tanna of I Mother Earth."', "The amp partnership ended, Joe sold his interest, and in 1997 he started Reverend Guitars, at first operating in the same ex-store and ex-amp-making premises in Eastpointe. The amplifier episode wasn't planned—it just sort of happened. It was guitars that Joe always aimed to build. So he thought that now he really ought to try what he originally wanted to do.", "Joe knew he'd have to compete, to come up with something he could produce relatively easily in a small building. In short, he had to get resourceful. He didn't have the large sums needed to buy a state-of-the-art facility with CNC machines and spray booths and so on. How could he do this?", 'His first idea was to eliminate painting, pretty much the toughest job for any electric guitar maker. So he came up with a body design that did not require painting. It had a moulded rim, onto which a pre-finished laminate top and back was added. This would be trimmed up, routed out, the hardware put on, and that was pretty much it. He wanted a guitar he could make in the US and sell for just under $500. "And aside from that," he says, "it was a very unusual looking guitar."', 'He admits to a fascination with old Danelectro and Silvertone guitars and their small semi-hollow bodies. He had a couple of Dano-made Silvertones and was amazed by their sound. "Both of them sounded incredible, and I figured out it was because they resonated. You could literally feel the body resonating every time you strummed."', 'That Dano resonance was a quality Joe tried to duplicate in his quest for resourcefulness. "I guess in a way I was trying to do something similar, to see what I could do with what was available—inexpensively, but more modern, with nicer hardware and nicer build quality. That\'s what led to the body design of the early Reverends, which I ended up getting a patent on—I called it the High Resonance Body."', 'One of the first Reverend catalogues described the body: "A wood-based phenolic top and back are laminated to a six-inch-wide white mahogany centre block, to which a small steel sustain bar is embedded." Joe laughs when I ask him what exactly wood-based phenolic is. "Sounds a lot nicer than Formica, because that\'s what it was. An early attempt at marketing, I guess."', 'And the center block makes us think of a 335, right? He explains that the block goes the length of the body, with a cutout in the mid treble-side where the pickups and wiring go. "We also do a little cutout into the mahogany at the opposite end of the neck, where we would bolt a small block of steel, which weighed about half a pound. That helped the sustain quite a bit, but it also balanced the guitar. It wasn\'t part of the original plan, but the guitar was so light that it was neck-heavy without the steel block. That definitely increased sustain, and of course it fixed the balance issue."', "Joe recalls maybe a dozen different prototypes to reach the final design. He'd started thinking about this type of construction back at the Roberto-Venn School of Luthiery, so the notion had been rattling around his head for 10 years or so. Leading up to Reverend, he experimented with different materials to check their effect on sound. He recalls trying tops of acrylic or aluminum, center blocks of pine, mahogany, or redwood.", '"I remember one with an aluminum top and back and a center block of foam, like the construction foam you\'d insulate a wall with. But that resonated so much it sounded like a 12-string," Joe says, adding with a smile: "Also, if you leaned too hard on the body you\'d leave a dent."', "With body construction decided, shape was the next consideration. At first, he was all over the board. He began with some single-cutaway ideas but quickly shifted to double-cutaway, mostly for balance, because he wanted a long upper horn to avoid a heavy neck. The Reverend shape he landed on had its influences for sure—some Fender here, a little Rickenbacker there—but Joe's prime intention was to draw enough from the classics to provide familiarity but add enough of his own flair to create something original, which is not as easy as it might sound.", 'He suggests that it\'s a matter of straddling the line between weird and unique. And that is a fine line. "Customers are very finicky about that," he says. "And the first thing they look at is the aesthetics. A guitar is something you wear. It\'s almost like buying a shirt, you know? So if the aesthetic is not spot on, then the sale\'s over, they\'re not gonna buy it."', 'People often ask Joe what the most challenging thing is about designing guitars. "I always tell them the hardest thing, first off, is the body shape. And then the second hardest thing is the headstock shape. And then maybe the pickguard shape after that. There\'s a certain aesthetic balance that, when you see it, you know you\'ve got it. But the hardware, electronics, all that stuff—none of that stuff has changed a whole lot from the \'50s. Obviously, hardware has advanced quite a bit, but the hardest part is making it look like something someone will buy."', "Joe recruited Kent Armstrong's WD Music to supply pickups. The types and combinations defined the major differences between the original Reverend models. This, too, was part of the drive to build something as efficiently as possible, and in this case that meant universal pickguards that simply had different pickup sets in them. The debut models included the Avenger, with a Strat-like layout; the Avenger GT, with two Strat-style single-coils and a bridge humbucker; the Commando, with a slanted lipstick at the neck plus bridge humbucker; the Rocco, with two humbuckers; and the Slingshot, with two P-90-like pickups; plus a couple of basses.", 'Reverend guitars—the brand name came when Joe saw a feature on Reverend Gary Davis in a blues magazine—were first seen in public at a NAMM trade show in July 1997. Joe recalls this as a pivotal event in the firm\'s early history. "My wife, Kristen, and I rented a 20-foot moving van, packed it full of guitars, drove it to Nashville, and set up our booth. We filled it entirely with turquoise guitars. That was the only color we brought. We thought it was the coolest color and that no one could ignore a booth full of turquoise. And it worked! We landed about a dozen dealers, some pretty big ones—and I thought OK, maybe I\'m not so crazy after all. Maybe this can work. I\'m sure Kristen was quite relieved as well."', 'There was a natty Two-Tone Teardrop case in line with some of the deco leanings of Joe\'s design vibe. At first, all Reverends had a banjo-style armrest, a Gretsch-like chromed guard that sat on the top body edge where your arm might reside. Joe says people either loved that feature or really, really hated it, with not a whole lot of undecideds. His own view is that you can never have too much chrome on a guitar. "That\'s how we think in Detroit! The Cadillac line of thought. More chrome? Why not."', 'Finishes for the phenolic tops soon blossomed into a vibrant array of possibilities. By the year 2000, options included Fireball Red,Powder Yellow, \'69 Lime Green,Deep Purple, as well as some glittery metal finishes, from Engine Turned Aluminum to Bug Eye Black Chrome and Lava Swirl to Diamond Plate. These were achieved with aluminum bonded to phenolic laminate described by the catalogue as "a three-dimensional finish and a unique tone with increased attack, sustain, chime, and harmonics."', 'The metal finishes did quite well, Joe says. "The Bug Eye Black Chrome was definitely the most popular, and probably one of the most popular finishes that we did during that era. At one point, in fact, we decided to do all metal finishes and discontinued the regular colors—though I\'m not sure it was the smartest move as we got a little pushback on that. But nobody had really done anything quite like those finishes."', "Those standout finishes helped the visibility of Reverend in the early years of the company, but also some notable players began picking up on the guitars. Joe mentions a few of the early adopters: Ron Asheton of The Stooges; Carl Verheyen, the LA studio ace; Henning Rümenapp of Guano Apes; Jeff Ross, with Candye Kane; Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins; and Rick Vito, then in Bonnie Raitt's band.", 'Billy Corgan tells me he met Joe at a trade show in 1999. "We just hit it off," he says. "I think I bought five guitars and basses that day, and I used them almost immediately on what became the Smashing Pumpkins album Machina." The Reverends Billy acquired were a mix of Slingshot guitars and Rumblefish four and five-string basses.', '"What attracted me to Reverend was the build quality of the guitars," he remembers, "and the unique use of materials at that time. Sort of a new take on old instruments that felt fresh." And how did they fit in with his other guitars at the time? "The Reverend tones seemed smoother and had more depth than my normal \'70s Strats," he concludes. "Let\'s call it a different kind of clarity."', 'Rick Vito had a fine guitar design of his own, the deco-drenched Streamliner. He\'d had the custom one-off built in the late \'80s by Toru Nittono, a Japanese luthier who worked then as a repairman at Norman\'s Rare Guitars in Reseda, California. Rick\'s inspiration for the distinctive look of the Streamliner came from the deco lap-steels of National and Supro. "I love the deco era," he tells me. "I love how it morphs into mid-century modern, \'50s style, how it even in a way entered into the early part of the \'60s. It\'s my favorite period of design." Rick debuted his Streamliner when he joined Fleetwood Mac in 1987.', '"That guitar was a pleasure right off the bat, it just worked, and I\'ve used it on tons of recordings and tons of tours," he says. By the time he came upon Reverend Guitars in the late \'90s, his main slide guitar was a \'56 Les Paul TV—the instrument he\'d used in the studio for Bob Seger\'s "Like A Rock"—plus a James Tyler Tele with two custom-wired humbuckers. He also had an original Burst, Broadcaster, and Nocaster. "I\'ve always been a vintage guitar collector and user, always loved traditional as well as trying to go into my own realm a little bit."', 'Those collectables became too valuable to trust to the vagaries of touring, and his fears in that direction helped steer him toward Reverend. "They were making quality guitars that I wouldn\'t feel uncomfortable about bringing on the road," he explains. A friend showed him a cool black Reverend with lipstick pickups, and toward the end of \'98, as he was about to go out with Bonnie Raitt in Europe opening for Eric Clapton, he called Joe.', 'After trying a lipstick-equipped Reverend Spy on that tour, Rick switched to a Slingshot, with P-90s. "I loved it," he recalls. "It was everything I\'d said I was hoping for. Played like a dream, sounded great. The Kent Armstrong P-90s they used had a little bit of a brighter sound than your average dark P-90—sort of a cross between a P-90 and a little brighter Fender-ish sound. You could really control it by rolling off the tone a bit to get more into Gibson, and if you had it full up it was slightly more Fender-ish."', 'Further Reverends followed for Rick, among them a Slingshot with a pink front and black back, to chime with his Pink & Black solo album, and a Rocco with a palm motif on an aluminum front. "They had a Fender-style C-shape neck at that point, very comfortable to play. They used really nice medium-jumbo frets, which made it even more easy to play, and I loved the lightweight quality of the original guitars, which were chambered on the inside. I used to hear people say you need the density of the wood and all that. Well, you don\'t need that to have a great sounding guitar, and the Reverends proved it to me."', 'Joe points out that a lot of the players that Reverend started working with in this early period are still on board today. Rick and Billy are good examples—the current line includes the Billy Corgan Signature and Billy Corgan Terz models as well as the Rick Vito Signature Soulshaker.', 'Back in the early days, as the word spread, the practicalities of running a guitar-making business became more evident to Joe on a day-to-day basis. "When you build a guitar from the bottom up, there\'s so many suppliers you\'ve got to deal with," he says by way of example. "Building one guitar I think involved maybe 36 suppliers, or something like that, when you count everything—hardware, screws, plastics, wood, and all the rest."', 'It was a running challenge to keep all that organized, to keep the supplies flowing, to ensure they did not run out of essentials. On top of that, somebody had to sell the guitars. At first, besides running the company, Joe was the guy selling everything. And then on top of that, he found himself going to a guitar show every six to eight weeks or so, and that usually involved driving across the country. "So," he pauses and laughs, "well—it was very grassroots in the first few years."', 'Slowly and satisfyingly, Reverend guitars began to enjoy growing success in those formative years at the end of the \'90s and into the 2000s. "We just wouldn\'t go away, for starters," Joe says, laughing some more.', '"The guitars were very unusual, and even if you didn\'t like them, you never forgot them. You always remember Reverend—because you love it, or you think it\'s ridiculous. We were able to put our name on the map pretty early on, because they were so unique. We were doing advertising and promotion, and we ran the infamous Kid Rock ad in \'98, where he\'s flipping the bird. And that really put our name on the map. They say there\'s no bad publicity, and we went with that. Everybody knew who we were, right away!"', 'By 2005, Reverend was ready for a sweeping change. The brand began to offer an imported line, at first called the Stage King series, and the following year Reverend officially discontinued all USA guitar production. Building at home had become more and more expensive.', '"By the time we discontinued the US guitars, they had almost tripled in price from the original \'97 price," Joe says. "That was simply down to just labour and supplies. It became impossible to build them here and still keep it a high-value at least mid-priced guitar. We were no longer able to hit that target. Sales were already starting to decline, and of course by then all the competition had already started importing. So we were already a little bit behind the curve. It was just an inevitable situation."', "Joe had taken a solo visit to NAMM where he went around asking people who they were working with, and then visited all the import Asian manufacturers' booths, inspecting everything in detail. Everybody he talked to kept pointing him to Mirr Music of South Korea. They had a good reputation and, crucially, were capable of doing custom work.", 'When Joe talked to Hank Cho, who runs Mirr, Hank said he could build anything Joe wanted. "He told me if I sent him a drawing, he could do it, no problem. So he was very open to custom designs, and he could do them in reasonably small quantities, too. Some of these guys won\'t talk to you unless you\'re doing a few thousand guitars a month or something like that, and we were nowhere close to that when we started out with the import thing. He could do custom and he could do low quantities. It was kind of a no-brainer."', "But this all marks the start of another story for another day. We'll leave Reverend for now at the turning point of their first era, in 2006, and on the cusp of the success that continues today amid a much-expanded line (and a record sales year in 2020). In 2010, Ken Haas became CEO and Penny Haas became COO, but Joe is still very much the brand's chief designer, and the firm is headquartered in Toledo, Ohio, following a move in 2015.", 'Back in the late \'90s, when Joe saw the first Reverends completed and ready for shipping, I wonder if he ever thought he\'d be here now, still busy designing, developing, and supporting Reverend guitars. "I did," he replies, with a refreshing absence of false modesty. "I felt like we had longevity, and when Ken became CEO and I was allowed to just design guitars, that put me in a very comfortable situation where I could do what I feel I do best. And not have to worry about running the company. That\'s when I felt that this could go for a long time."', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

Icy synthesizers. Robotic vocals. These are the hallmarks of classic electro, a genre of music that ruled the clubs, rollerskating rinks, and backyard breakdance battles in the 1980s. Although it only lasted a short period of time—roughly from 1982 until 1986—its influence can still be felt (and heard) today in modern dance music, pop, and hip-hop.', 'While this piece won\'t get too deep into the history of electro (for that, we recommend our thorough "A Not-So-Brief History Of Electro"), we will shine a light on the gear used in 10 seminal tracks, as well as some of the recording tricks the artists used to get their signature sounds.', "While it's not much of a spoiler alert to say that the Roland TR-808 drum machine played a big part, as did vocoders, like the similarly vocoder-abusing robot Transformers, there's more to electro than meets the eye.", 'Any conversation about electro naturally starts with Afrika Bambaataa and "Planet Rock." Released in 1982 on New York hip-hop label Tommy Boy, "Planet Rock" was an instant sensation and introduced the world to a new kind of dance music. It was recognizably hip-hop—there was rapping after all—but the usual disco drums and backing band were replaced with a drum machine and synthesizers. This is how they did it.', 'Of course, that drum machine was the Roland TR-808. It had already been on the market for two years when Bambaataa and producer Arthur Baker cut "Planet Rock," which likely caused a boost in sales, at least in big cities with access to dance clubs. The punchline? According to legend, they didn\'t even own one and hired a guy they found in a classified ad to bring one in and program it.', '"Planet Rock" is pretty minimal—another defining element of electro—with little but glassy synth strings to provide musical accompaniment. These came courtesy of future New Order producer John Robie and his Sequential Circuits Prophet-5. The polyphonic Prophet-5 would go on to appear on a ton of classic electro tracks (see below). It was played live by Robie, purposely aping Kraftwerk\'s "Trans Europe Express," one of Bambaataa\'s favorite records at the time. (The beat was also influenced by Kraftwerk, specifically "Numbers.")', 'Additional instrumentation included bass from a Moog Micromoog (played, as with the Prophet-5, live by Robie) and the soon-to-be ubiquitous orchestra hit banged out on a Fairlight that they found in the studio. While often misidentified as a vocoder, the vocal effect in "Planet Rock" is actually Bambaataa rapping through a Lexicon PCM 41.', 'Heavy 808, cold synths, snappy bass, minimal arrangement, and robotic vocals—the basic building blocks of "Planet Rock" would be used again and again in the next few years, and beyond. The "Planet Rock" sessions also yielded the backing tracks for Planet Patrol\'s "Play at Your Own Risk," a vocal-lead R&B number that kicked off the R&B/electro crossover movement.', 'While many of electro\'s major players were in New York, the genre was by no means restricted to the Big Apple. Gregory Broussard, better known as the Egyptian Lover, was at the forefront of Los Angeles electro, a scene that also included a pre-N.W.A. Dr. Dre and his World Class Wreckin\' Cru and the L.A. Dream Team. "Egypt, Egypt," with its Middle Eastern-style melodies and vocoder boasts, is his crowning achievement.', 'At the center of the track is a devastating beat laid down on the Roland TR-808. What really sets the Egyptian Lover\'s 808 apart from others is his use of the trigger pulse as a percussion element. The engineer for the "Egypt, Egypt" sessions accidentally hooked up the trigger out to the mixing board but it sounded so good they left it in.', 'The synthesizer on the track is none other than the Roland Jupiter-8. As with "Planet Rock," it provides melodic support but largely stays out of the way to let the drum machine do its thing. The Egyptian Lover was a DJ for the party collective Uncle Jamm\'s Army and he arranged "Egypt, Egypt" as a dance song, with placement of turnarounds and other song elements reflecting how he would cut in records to keep the dancefloor hyped.', 'The last piece of the "Egypt, Egypt" puzzle is the vocoder. While there were a number of units around in 1984, the vocoder of choice for most electro artists was the rackmount Roland SVC-350. It was the same for the Egyptian Lover and it\'s what gives this track such flavor.', 'The Egyptian Lover is still going, DJing, touring, and releasing records using largely the same gear. His latest record, 1986, is out now.', 'Most of the electro cuts on this list are fairly minimal, with just a drum machine and a single synth to provide a skeletal melodic motif. Not "Electric Kingdom." Released by Twilight 22 in 1983, the track is a real tour de force, packed full of synthesizers expertly played.', 'The men behind the music were Gordon Bahary, a keyboard whiz who had previously worked with Stevie Wonder and Herbie Hancock, and Joseph Saulter, who provided vocals along with Bahary. We got in touch with Bahary to get the story behind the song.', "No surprises that the drum machine the duo used was the TR-808. However, Bahary augmented the rhythms from Roland's machine with some sounds that he made with an ARP Odyssey synthesizer.", '"I had created a drum machine long before they were actually manufactured," he explains. "This was in 1977 for Stevie Wonder. We were at IAM Studios in Irvine, California recording his followup to Songs in the Key of Life. I created a kick and snare on the ARP." The Odyssey was also used to provide the bassline (played live!) as well as the lower sound that underpins the 808 kicks.', 'The Odyssey also allowed Bahary to create ring modulation sounds for use as accents. "The ring modulation was done with the ARP. I had created a touch-sensitive keyboard before they were manufactured. So the harder I pressed, the louder the sound, or the filter would open, or both, giving it expression," he says. "Years later it became standard."', 'When asked if he used a polysynth on the record, Bahary says, "Yes, the (Sequential Circuits) Prophet-5 for harmony on the lead melody. Very fat sound and great filters." All of those unique melodies were inspired by his childhood. "My parents are from the Middle East, and these types of melodies were always playing in the house as a kid. I wanted to take the most opposite musical ideas and combine them."', '"Electric Kingdom" is full of choral sounds and orchestral percussion as well, like timpani. These were played with an E-Mu Emulator. "The E-Mu sampler was used for voices," Bahary says. "It had a floppy disk. I recall the anticipation for a small file to be loaded." The harpsichord, however, was not sampled, but real. "I saw it at Kingdom Sound Studios (coincidentally named) and [asked] the engineer, \'Can we do a take with this?\'"', 'Lastly, the vocoder was a Korg VC-10.', 'Bahary is still active in music and has just built Electric Kingdom Studios in New York, complete with the new Rupert Neve 5088 automated console and 24-track tape. His new solo album will be released later this year through The Orchard/Sony.', 'The influence of Kraftwerk is strong in classic electro. "Planet Rock" combined "Numbers" and "Trans Europe Express" into one potent whole. The Egyptian Lover has described his music as Kraftwerk meets Prince. The influence of the four Germans is also apparent in the "Home Computer"-like climbing chromatic sequence that forms the repeating motif for "Clear," the 1983 dance floor bomb by Detroit\'s Cybotron.', 'Comprising future techno architect Juan Atkins and Vietnam veteran Rik Davis, Cybotron took their electronic experiments to the next level after hearing "Planet Rock" on a trip to New York and buying an 808. This formed the backbone for "Clear," as it did for so many other classic electro tunes.', 'There is less clear information on the making of "Clear" than some other tracks but there are clues and decades-later recollections.', '"Clear," like other electro jams, has the requisite icy synth strings. Polysynths, however, were extremely expensive in 1982 when they recorded the song. It\'s unsurprising then that they turned to a Roland RS-09 string machine for poly duties.', 'Other gear in Davis\' arsenal at the time included an ARP Odyssey and Axxe as well as a Sequential Circuits Pro One, a favorite for bass and popular with electro producers at the time. Atkins\' first synth was the Korg MS-10, which, as he explained in an interview with MusicRadar, he used for "weird, UFO-type sounds and effects."', 'Atkins told Reverb earlier this year that the Pro One\'s sequencer was an integral part of "Clear": "I had a TR-808, a Pro One, and a Korg MS-10. And what you could do with the Pro One is that it had a sequencer on it and you could trigger the sequence from the trigger out from the 808."', 'Cybotron would soon break up but Atkins would continue evolving electro (and later techno) as Model 500. While electro soon died out in its birth place of New York, it continued to be popular in Detroit, with groups like Drexciya and Aux 88 furthering the sound.', 'A funky bassline. High-pitched cartoon voices. A story about a sound clash between aliens and Superman. In 1984, there was no cut more popular with breakdancing kids than Newcleus\' "Jam On It." We spoke with Ben Cenac, aka Cozmo D, about how the song came together.', 'Like most other electro tracks, Cenac managed to get a lot of mileage out of a few pieces of gear. "I was forced to make the most of a very limited situation back then," he explains. Again, the drum machine of choice was the TR-808. There was nothing else that could even come close in terms of analog impact.', "As for that incredible bassline, it was provided by the Sequential Circuits Pro One. Essentially one voice of the Prophet-5, it was a go-to bass synth for lots of electronic acts in the early '80s. And not just electro either—it was even a favorite of Skinny Puppy.", 'The sequenced line in the track came from another famous Roland box, the TB-303. The 303 didn\'t really get popular until the Chicago guys started to abuse it a few years later, but its use in electro wasn\'t without precedence either. Check out Shannon\'s "Let The Music Play" for another example.', "Remember Cybotron's Roland RS-09? Newcleus used one too. Although by this time string machines had a reputation for being cheesy, you get the most from what you can.", 'We asked Cenac how he was able to sync everything together, this being before MIDI. "The 808 and the 303 were programed individually in song mode and synced together via a Roland Sync cable," he explains. "The bassline was programed using one of the Pro One\'s two 16-step sequences and triggered via the 808\'s accent out."', 'Lastly, we just had to ask how they made the famous wikki wikki voices. "We slowed down the master tapes to record the vocals." Sometimes it\'s just that simple.', '"It\'s time!" With that famous vocoder intro, 17-year-old Jerry Calliste Jr., better known as Hashim, announced his presence to the world. His debut record, "Al-Naayfish (The Soul)"—with its insistent broken beat, eerie synth strings, and turntable scratching—has become one of the most recognizable entries in the electro canon.', 'The inaugural release on Cutting Records, "Al-Naayfish (The Soul)" was made—like most classic electro—with very few pieces of gear. Like Cozmo D and Newcleus, Hashim made the most with what he had, building up the song at New York\'s Secret Sound Studio with a single drum machine and synthesizer.', "The main focus of the song is, of course, Roland's TR-808 drum machine. With so much 808-based hip-hop happening in New York in the early '80s, local music shops must have been doing a brisk business.", 'The rest of the record was accomplished with one synth. No, not the Prophet-5, although that would be a very good guess. Hashim instead used a Korg Poly-61 to provide bass, strings, and the arpeggio, the latter likely synced to the 808 to match the tempo.', 'Hashim would follow up "Al-Naayfish (the Soul)" with another devastating electro record, "We\'re Rocking the Planet," which would add an Oberheim DMX to the percussion mix. The DMX, which used samples rather than analog synthesis, was the other big hip-hop drum machine, popular with artists of the time like Run-D.M.C. and (unsurprisingly) Davy DMX.', '"Planet Rock" may have been the record that turned New York onto electro, but "Rockit" turned on the world. Produced by Bill Laswell of Material and something of a last-chance gamble for Herbie Hancock, "Rockit" combined electro rhythms, scratching, and of course Herbie\'s incendiary playing into a cultural touchstone.', "Let's start with the rhythm section. Laswell and his team put together a backing track, using an Oberheim DMX supplemented with a Synare likely triggered by the DMX. Laswell was a bass player by trade, and although the bassline in the track feels like it was fingered, it's too synthetic for a guitar. The Moog Minimoog listed in the album credits is the more likely candidate.", 'Once the backing track was done, Laswell went into the studio with Herbie, who wrote the famous lead melody. This was played on a Rhodes Chroma and overdubbed a number of times to create a wide feel.', 'Herbie also wanted to add some scat vocals and used his Sennheiser VSM-201 vocoder to achieve this. The VSM-201 is the same vocoder that Kraftwerk used on their records and—while too rare and expensive for most electro producers—was not out of the reach of Hancock.', 'The final key element to "Rockit" was Grandmixer D.ST\'s scratching, with the DJ wearing down the grooves in a copy of Fab Five Freddy\'s "Change The Beat." "Rockit" also contains a Led Zeppelin guitar stab from the album Coda, triggered from a Lexicon Prime Time delay unit.', 'Herbie\'s gamble with "Rockit" paid off big time and it helped bring the jazz veteran back into the limelight, shining some light on hip-hop and electro at the same time.', 'Electro is generally associated with New York but it had a massive presence in Miami as well. Known down south as freestyle and later as bass music, Miami\'s love for electro was largely down to the efforts of one man, Pretty Tony. The brains behind Freestyle ("Don\'t Stop The Rock"), Debbie Deb ("When I Hear Music"), Trinere ("They\'re Playing Our Song"), Tony also served up records under his own name.', '"Fix It In The Mix" was the first Pretty Tony record. Released in 1984, it was made—like many other electro songs—with the bare minimum of equipment. Like Hashim and "Al-Naayfish (The Soul)," Tony managed to get all of that music from just a single drum machine and synthesizer (and of course a vocoder).', "The drum machine? Why, of course it's the Roland TR-808. No matter whether New York, Los Angeles, Detroit, or Miami, the drum machine of choice for classic electro was the 808. The 808 would go on to play an even bigger role in Miami bass music, with samples of the boom extending its power and bass response.", 'As for Tony\'s synthesizer, like Hashim he opted for something different than the Prophet-5. "Fix It In The Mix" was made entirely with a Roland Juno-60, an instrument not usually associated with hip-hop. After a few hit records, Tony would actually go on to buy a Prophet-5 though.', 'One of the defining moments of "Fix It In The Mix," particularly in the B-side dub, is the sound of breaking glass. While he later used an Emulator, on this track he had to do it the old-fashioned way: by recording it with a microphone. "The breaking glass, I took a cardboard box and I put a dumbbell in it," he explained in an interview with Red Bull Music Academy. "I hung the mic over down in it and threw a champagne glass, hit record, and broke it. That drove people crazy."', "Unlike the Egyptian Lover, Pretty Tony never used his own voice on his records, only vocoders. While it's hard to find confirmation, it's a good bet to assume that he used the Roland SVC-350, the rackmount version of the VP-330. This same unit was favored by Dynamix II, who would keep the flame of Miami electro lit into the '90s and beyond.", 'Whodini—comprising Jalil Hutchins, John Fletcher (aka Ecstasy), and DJ Grandmaster Dee—were one of the first hip-hop groups to have sizable hits. Their debut single, "Magic\'s Wand," a primer on the history of rap and radio host Mr. Magic, wasn\'t one of them. However, it wasn\'t for a lack of trying. With production from a young Thomas Dolby, it\'s got one of the most infectious rhythms in hip-hop. Let\'s see if we can tease out how it was made.', '"Magic\'s Wand" came out in 1982, around the same time as Dolby\'s debut album, The Golden Age of Wireless. It\'s safe to assume that the gear employed on "Magic\'s Wand" would be similar to that of his own release. For both, he avoided the use of any typical drum machines. No TR-808 or DMX here. Dolby instead used a Simmons electronic drum set triggered by Tangerine Dream\'s old PPG 360 Wave Computer. Esoteric but what do you expect from Thomas Dolby? He also had a Fairlight, which could have been used to add percussive noises.', 'How about the bass? There\'s clearly a fretless bass involved but the synth bass could have been a Moog Source, as played on "She Blinded Me With Science," or a Micromoog, which he used when playing live around the time.', 'While "Magic\'s Wand" is not your typical electro track, it does have some deliciously funky synthesizer playing, including some chords that could only come from a polysynth. Dolby was known to use a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5. We\'d put our money on it.', "Lastly, let's address the vocoder that delivers the hook. In a sequence recorded for TV show Riverside, Dolby demonstrates some of the gear he used around this time. There is a Roland VP-330 clearly in the background. It fits the bill.", '"Magic\'s Wand" would appear on their debut self-titled album in 1983, alongside tracks recorded with Kraftwerk-producer Conny Plank. Not your typical hip-hop backing tracks, to say the least.', 'We started in New York in 1982 and that\'s where we\'re going to end. Man Parrish\'s "Hip Hop, Be Bop (Don\'t Stop)" was released around the same time as "Planet Rock" and coincidentally also featured synth playing by John Robie. Despite using similar equipment, the two tracks could not be more different. Where "Planet Rock" is tight, "Hip Hop" is loose and more experimental, almost psychedelic at times. Let\'s check out the gear Man Parrish used to create his influential record.', '"That (record) except for a few overdubs was basically done in my bedroom on an eight track/channel Tascam tape recorder and mixer," Man Parrish told Magazine Sixty. "\'Hip Hop Be Bop\' was just basically me playing around with some sounds and grooves that then got developed into the track you hear now."', 'As with most other seminal electro cuts—and despite being one of the first electro records released—"Hip Hop Be Bop" employed a TR-808 to provide the beats. The drum machine\'s famous cowbells are particularly well represented.', "Man Parrish has stated that he used two synthesizers on this track, both from Sequential Circuits: a Prophet-5 and Pro One. While he doesn't specify which synth played the bass, it's safe to assume it was the Pro One, given that it's a sequenced line, and Man states that he made use of the onboard eight-note sequencer.", '"You have to remember, this was all way before MIDI, and before computers," he explained in the same interview. "We had to do all kinds of tricks to synchronize the different tracks on tape to play at the same time… Everything from punching in and out of the track, overdubs, and using the 808 drum machine to send trigger pulses, via the rimshot pattern, to advance the analog sequencer to the next step. We basically wrote the sequencer rhythm part on the drum machine, and the sound of the rimshot pulsing would drive the analog sequencer."', 'Man Parrish would follow-up "Hip Hop, Be Bop (Don\'t Stop)" with the more conventional "Boogie Down Bronx" and would have a Top 20 hit in the UK in 1987 with "Male Stripper."', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

It doesn't take a genius to determine your likely answer. You may be surprised, however, to hear that some people disagree. To demonstrate, we're going to consider as a case study a certain Fender Stratocaster owned at one time, apparently rather briefly, by a certain James Marshall Hendrix.", "It's June 1967, and love is all around. Jimi Hendrix is dressed in his brilliantly colored stage clothes and is busy tuning guitars in a dressing room backstage at the Saville Theatre in London. In the distance, he can hear Procol Harum playing in the main hall. He moves methodically between his main Strats and a Flying V, but also he prepares a special Strat that he plans to sacrifice at the end of his set in the evening performance.", "Jimi arrived in London from New York in September the previous year, 1966. With his manager Chas Chandler, he soon recruited Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell to form the Experience, where he played Stratocasters right from the start. In our case study here, however, we'll focus on an example with a Candy Apple Red body that became the sacrificial Saville guitar.", "Jimi and his roadie were in the habit of exploiting Fender's bolt-together construction and would swap bodies, necks, pickguards, and more to make amends for the damage Jimi inflicted during his wilder on-stage antics.", "Regardless of where the bits and pieces of this particular guitar originated and how long they'd been mated, we do know how much guitars cost back in the mid-'60s. A brand new custom color Stratocaster similar to Jimi's red one had a UK list price then of £180/12/0. That's 180 pounds (£), 12 shillings (after the first /), and zero pence (after the second slash), which decimalized Brits would write later as £180.60.", 'In London in early \'67, Jimi would have shelled out between about £60 and £100 for a secondhand Strat. In February, for example, the Pan shop above London\'s Flamingo Club advertised a "Fender Stratocaster, good, red" for £65. Let\'s assume this was about the price the Saville guitar cost The Jimi Hendrix Experience. It didn\'t stay "good" for long, though, because Jimi managed to whack a large split in the body during a lively Scandinavian gig in May.', 'The damaged Fender seemed beyond repair, but Jimi decided to make good use of it. The Saville show was the last British gig before the band went off to the United States until August—including the Monterey Pop Festival where he would destroy another decorated Strat—so he wanted this gig and this guitar to mark a sort of farewell.', 'Jimi painted the front of the battered red Strat with black and white swirly foliage and hearts. The back he painted over in white, handily covering the split, and he added a couple of flowers and a message in black marker pen: "May this be love or just confusion, born out of frustration-wracked feelings of not being able to make true physical love to the universal gypsie queen of true, free expressed music. My darling guitar, please rest in peace. Amen." Jimi wrote the date and location of the gig alongside.', 'At the Saville, Jimi\'s trio went on to play their final set. Knowing that Paul McCartney and George Harrison were in the audience, they opened with a cover of "Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band," released a matter of days prior. After a delay caused by problems with mics and amps, they soldiered on and finished triumphantly with "Are You Experienced." During that finale, a roadie had the prepared Strat ready.', '"A packed Saville Theatre audience erupted on Sunday night as Jimi Hendrix announced that this would be his last gig in Britain "\'for a long, long time,\'" Hugh Nolan reported in Disc and Music Echo, "and then [Hendrix] proceeded to smash a beautifully-painted guitar and hurl the pieces into the clamoring crowd—a guitar he\'d painted in glorious swirling colors and written a poem on the back dedicated to Britain and its audiences. Bathed in a flickering strobe light, he crashed the guitar about the stage and hurled what was left of it to eager souvenir-hunters in the audience."', 'Those souvenir hunters evidently saved their treasure for nearly 25 years. Let\'s jump forward to Sotheby\'s auction house in August 1991. Lot 420, to be precise: "Two Pieces of a Guitar Smashed by Jimi Hendrix, 1967." Perhaps the owners perked up the previous year, 1990, when a Strat—sold as the guitar Jimi used at Woodstock—went for a record £198,000 (about $325,000 at the time).', 'Maybe that persuaded them the time was right to have a rummage in the attic. They were right to do so. The auction estimate for an "incomplete body of a Fender Stratocaster," along with an accompanying Saville concert programme, was £4,500–£6,500. The two halves, split right along Jimi\'s original Scandinavian crack and with most of his poem intact on the backs, sold for a hefty £29,700.', "There are a few ways to work out what a historical amount of cash might be worth in today's money. None of them are precise, which is hardly surprising, because the calculations involve things like average earnings—but how average is average?—and treacherous mathematical stuff like price indexes and inflation fluctuations.", "With those caveats in mind, such calculations can give us a rough idea about the then-and-now of the sums we've been juggling.", "* The Saville Strat would have cost the equivalent in today's money of about £3,800/$5,300 when it was a new guitar in the '60s (remember that original £180.60?).", "* You'd need to have about £1,200/$1,700 today to match the 65 quid or so Jimi paid when he picked up the Strat secondhand around the early months of '67.", "* The £29,700 realized at auction in 1991 for the dismembered body parts would be about £68,000/$96,000 in today's money. As for what it might make if current owner, the MoPOP Museum of Pop Culture, in Seattle ever decided to sell—well, shall we guess at comfortably six and possibly seven figures?", "* And suppose Jimi never smashed that guitar. Let's presume its true identity was lost over the years as it was sold and traded around. Such a relatively anonymous mid-'60s Strat in Candy Apple Red could be yours, for sure, just so long as you can afford today's ticket price for this kind of collectable. Let's say around £15,000/$22,000 or so—depending on the exact year, originality, and condition, of course.", "Fed up with figures? Right, put down that favorite guitar of yours for a moment, and let me once more ask you the question we started with. Now that you know all this, do you still think your instrument is worth more completely intact, or could it soar in value once it's shattered in pieces?", 'Reviewing Jimi\'s Saville gig in 1967, the unimpressed music critic Chris Welch wrote in Melody Maker: "Running half an hour overtime, the group concluded with a freak-out of guitar smashing by strobe light. Bits of the guitar were then thrown into the audience for collectors, while Mitch\'s drum stand was left in a state of collapse. Own up lads, who needs all that?" What a pity Mitch Mitchell didn\'t put his collapsed kit out of its misery and smash it to smithereens. Who knows what all those bits might be worth now?', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

He wondered if Seymour could analyze his Burst’s twin PAFs, the holy grail of humbucking pickups.', 'Billy knew these pickups had magnetic coils inside, and that the vibration of a string hovering over the coils would excite their magnetic field, causing a current to flow and (stop me if this is getting too technical) in turn causing delightful guitar tone to come out of that amp over there.', '"We plugged Pearly Gates into an ohm meter," Billy tells me. "Seymour said, ‘Give me a Texas G.’ I strummed away, strummed away, and it appeared that the pickups that ride on my instrument are extremely robust. He said, ‘Gee whiz, I’m getting a reading hotter than I’ve ever seen.’ He said he’d had a hundred of these PAFs come through, that this was their standard test, trying to determine what these pickups potentially can put out, voltage wise."', 'Gibson’s original humbucking pickup, known as the PAF and introduced in 1957, is still the design that provokes more analysis, more copies, more half-truths, more arguments, and more money for a (hopefully) original set than any other type you care to name. With all the improvements in pickup design that have come along in the 60 years and more since Seth Lover presented the prototype to his bosses at Gibson, PAFs still command hushed reverence among those in the know.', 'PAF is shorthand for Patent Applied For, because that’s what a small black sticker on the base said. It remained in place until about 1962, when a new sticker with a patent number appeared there. Further changes around 1964 drew this era of Gibson’s humbucking development to a close, and to vintage fans, nothing can touch that original design.', 'Around 1971, Billy paid a visit to the Gibson factory in Kalamazoo. This was not what we’d now consider the golden period. But seven years or so after the end of that first great pickup era is closer than most of us have managed.', '"It was dead of winter, snowing like crazy, but we got the 50 cent tour, the whole bit, top to bottom," Billy recalls. "We went up to the room where they were making humbucking pickups. We saw the original machine that the famous PAFs were made on. Three ladies were operating the machine. It was a long rod, running left to right, with three wrapping points: one on the left end, one in the centre, and one on the right end. These ladies would slide a pickup bobbin down to the centre and put one on either end."', 'Billy says he watched as the women wound .42 gauge enamel wire onto a spool under a glass dome and that the wire was fed through a hole in the top of the dome. "They would put this wire on to each bobbin," he continues, "and they had a clicker, something like the winding stem on a wristwatch, connected to a counter. You could set how many turns you wanted the motor to spin. Once the wires were in place, they’d hit a switch, the motor would start spinning the rod, and the bobbins would be flying, dragging the wire off the spool."', 'He remembers a guide that went left to right—he reckons it was much like the gadget a fishing reel has, and it allowed the pickup wire to be laid into the bobbin in a fairly sophisticated way, left to right, right to left, and so on. When the clicker hit the defined number of turns, it would trigger the off switch.', '"What I noticed—and this is probably why some humbuckers sound different, with more oomph or power—is that the ladies had a footbrake, a long bar," Billy says. "When the motor stopped, it would make a noticeable click, so that they knew that particular bobbin was complete. They would step on the brake and it slowed the turning mechanism. And if they were talking, well—when we were there, we noticed they didn’t always step on the brake straight away, so another couple hundred turns got put on the bobbin. It was not an exact science."', 'It was not an exact science. This might well be the catchphrase that sums up the story of the pickup we have under our microscope. Fortunately, though, our guide among this rocky terrain is Thomas Nilsen, a Norwegian pickup specialist now resident in England. Thomas runs Cream T Pickups, and he employs science in the shape of his patented analogue spectrum recorder, which he uses to accurately scan and analyze old pickups. He’s worked with Billy and many other tone hounds who want to know what makes great pickups great.', 'Thomas grew up listening to Clapton and Green and Gibbons and the rest. "And when I was old enough to understand the basics of how an electric guitar was built and took my first one apart," he tells me, "I was on the hunt to find out how these great players got their amazing tone and sound. It didn’t take long before I understood it was all about going back to the pickups in their Les Paul guitars, specifically those made from 1958 to 1960. This was my base point, and it marked the start for my long journey that’s still going on today."', 'So, Thomas, why all the fuss surrounding the PAF humbuckers? The ones made from 1957 into the very early ‘60s. "Original PAFs have an open and very transparent sound," he explains, "and they react more honestly to your guitar’s tone settings, to how you attack the strings, and from there through your amps. This is what the original old PAFs have that no other pickups, say from the 1970 to ’90 era, have at all."', 'That sound is what many players and most modern pickup makers are chasing. And that sound is what creates the aura around original PAFs. So there’s some consistency there, Thomas? "Well, yes and no," he says. "The thing that is so interesting with PAF pickups is that none sound similar." He’s analyzed close on 60 sets of PAFs from 1957 to ’60, mostly examples taken from Gibson ES models and Les Pauls of the period.', '"Most of the PAFs from this era vary a lot regarding the types of magnet and the output," he says. "None are the same. The important thing to remember is that this was the period when Gibson was experimenting with the humbuckers in their quest to develop and make them better. I call it the test and trial period. So when I scan PAFs from this period, I find a big variation in how much bass, middle, and treble there is at the various frequencies. As I say, the consistent thing is that they are very open and transparent sounding pickups."', 'Surely all this fuss around the original PAFs indicates they are the greatest humbucking pickups ever made. "No," Thomas says, "a vintage PAF is the base and foundation of the greatest humbucker ever made. I know that some humbuckers being made now sound much better. Not many, but there are a handful of humbucker models made now that sound much better. That’s because some pickup makers, including me, have taken what was started back then and added more to it. We have the torch now and we’ll bring it further into new development."', 'Thomas’s particular torch is his Super Scanner. It grew from discussions he had with Billy about finding a way to accurately scan PAFs in a guitar. Few owners would welcome desoldering and removing these valuable items. So Thomas and a friend spent two years developing the scanner, and from that he created a handheld version, which he uses today to reveal information about the key assemblies inside a PAF.', '"The hardest and most challenging way for a modern maker to achieve that famous old vintage PAF tone is to replicate the winding pattern, the type of wire and tension used in that winding, and how the magnet is oriented," he says. "The rest is not helpful. If you try to use and source the correct covers with the right corners, the same plastic for the bobbins, and so on—all that has nothing to do with the sonic part of a PAF. I repeat: the only factors that decide the real sound of a PAF are type of wire, winding pattern, and magnet."', 'I imagine Thomas is not as concerned as some Burst nuts about the alleged sonic contribution made by the color of plastic—black or cream or both—used at various times for those bobbins inside a PAF. He laughs out loud and shakes his head.', '"I met a guy years ago," he says, "and he was dead serious, he said, ‘Hey Thomas, I can hear the difference between a one-ply pickguard and a three-ply pickguard.’ And I thought, you know, he must have this horrible life. Think about how much stuff he must hear around him every day as he just walks around. I wouldn’t like to be in his shoes."', 'What’s the biggest mystery that remains about PAF pickups? "When we were working on the PAFs in Billy’s Pearly Gates to create the WhiskerBucker pickup set," Thomas recalls, "I kept saying that, to be honest, these pickups are so special, that they are so far off the consistent things of all the other PAFs I’ve heard from that period.', '"That guitar and its pickups sound amazing compared to others. And Billy says, ‘Well, do you think it’s possible to find out who made them, to figure out which lady wound the pickups in my Pearly Gates?’ I said, ‘Billy, I think that option is long gone now.’ But it is a mystery that would be so good to solve. Wouldn’t that be great?"', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music. His books include Sunburst and The Gibson 335 Guitar Book.

This was for a book about recording classic records that I planned to do with my colleague John Morrish, but the project got no further than a small number of interviews, including these about the making of Never Mind The Bollocks Here's The Sex Pistols.", 'Chris and Bill worked with the band at various stages from 1976 and the first single, "Anarchy In The U.K," through to the album released the following year.', 'Chris, had you seen the Sex Pistols live before being approached to record them?', "Chris Thomas (CT): I'd known Malcolm [McLaren, Pistols manager] for some time—he was interested in getting me involved with the New York Dolls, doing them. Then I didn't see him for a while, and he contacted me about the Sex Pistols at the time that they'd signed for EMI [in October 1976].", "Previous to that I had seen them because Chris Spedding was in contact with them—there were a lot of people who sort of knew each other at that time. I was doing all my work then at Air [studio, central London] and I'd been working with Spedding. He got me down to see the Pistols—they played at the Screen on the Green [August '76], which I think was the same night that The Clash played for the first time. Spedding was going on about the Pistols—he'd done some demos with them, had put them into RAK [studio, north-west London].", "The Sex Pistols did loads and loads of sessions with different people, they were always popping into studios. Then it came to the point to go into the studio to do their first single, and that was with Dave Goodman in Wessex [studio, north London]. I didn't know anything about Wessex, I'd never been there before. I knew Bill [Price] from when he used to work at Air.", 'And then Malcolm McLaren approached me about producing them. So they sent me some demos, I heard loads of stuff: Dave Goodman demos, Chris Spedding demos. I heard the stuff and I liked the material, it was as simple as that. So Malcolm fixed up for me to have a meeting with them, they came round to my house—minus John[ny Rotten]. Apparently Malcolm thought that meeting John might put me off the project.', 'Bill Price (BP): Chris was a very successful producer of rock records, and of bands that were not necessarily avant-garde, but were new things. When he was first involved in, say, Roxy Music, they were quite a futuristic thing. So I would have thought it was quite a logical choice.', 'Chris, did it seem a logical choice to you?', 'CT: I\'ve always taken on a job if I\'ve been interested in what I\'ve been asked to do, you know? The thing was: What are the songs like? And listening to the demos of stuff like "Pretty Vacant," they were great. That was the reason I decided I wanted to do it. If I\'d heard stuff and I\'d decided it was a load of rubbish, I wouldn\'t have done it. Once it comes down to that nitty-gritty of who asks me what I want to do, it always comes down to the same sort of thing in the end.', "At the time, some people seemed surprised to see your name on the Pistols album, when it eventually came out, considering you'd worked with The Beatles and so on.", "CT: Yeah, I can see that, because obviously people's ideas of what you are come purely from what they read on the back of record covers, and they put you in a certain bag. Later on in that year, I was doing Paul McCartney in the afternoon and the Sex Pistols at night. Real chalk and cheese, but I love that. That appeals to me.", 'So the first time you two worked with the Pistols was late in 1976?', "CT: Yes, and the reason for working with Bill, simply, was that they had been working in Wessex, I think they'd been doing that with Tim Friese-Greene engineering and Dave Goodman producing. They were there, they seemed comfortable with that, so I said if you want to stay there, in that case I'd like Bill to engineer it, because I know him and I don't know the studio. That was the reason that I started working with Bill.", 'BP: I have some notes here, because I\'ve gone back over our tape-library records [at Wessex studio]. So, on November 6 and 7, 1976, Chris and I recorded "Anarchy In The U.K." for the first time. Then we recorded it again a bit later, and my note says we did 19 takes of it [laughs].', "Interestingly enough, it had been recorded at the same studio [Wessex], but with Dave Goodman supposedly producing, which was paid for by EMI Records. That was on October 16, 1976. Dave was their sound guy, to a certain extent. He was a part-time producer and engineer and was involved with the band from their earliest days. He was very good, I think. They tried recording in cheap studios, in home studios, in clubs with live equipment, so they'd already tried recording their stuff. But I think they just discovered that it's not going to produce something more credible just because it's a backstreet recording.", 'Dave Goodman recorded this very interesting bunch of songs in October: "I Wanna Be Me," "17," "No Feelings," "New York," "Anarchy," "Stepping Stone," "No Fun," "Problems," "Substitute," "Pretty Vacant," "Satellite," "No Lip," and "Submission." That\'s virtually their entire repertoire, and possibly with the addition of "Bodies" and maybe one other song remained pretty much all they ever produced.', 'So Chris and I recorded "Anarchy" twice, and also on that batch of sessions we recorded "No Future," which is a song whose title changes quite a lot [it became "God Save The Queen"]. There was "No Future," "No Feelings," "Pretty Vacant," and "Stepping Stone", as well as "Anarchy"—that was the first batch of sessions. "Anarchy" was then released as the single on EMI Records [on November 26, 1976, with Goodman\'s "I Wanna Be Me" as b-side]', 'CT: When we did "Anarchy," in other words the first sessions, that was like real—what\'s it all about! Specially when it came to the point of actually working with John. We put the backing track down, and I still hadn\'t met him. It was all getting a little bit strange, shenanigans going on already. He came in to do his vocal and he was really disgruntled—because he\'d been sort of left out of things, and he didn\'t know about it. So already there was a bit of an atmosphere.', 'Bit by bit I think we managed to sort it out. I know at one point we went down to Ramport [studio, south London] and we tried working on the vocal there a bit as well—it was like, "Where\'s available?" Found Ramport, went there for an afternoon, and I think did another couple of odd guitar bits, too.', 'Was Johnny aware of your track record?', 'CT: Oh, very much so. That came out at that very first meeting, when we came to do those vocals. I remember saying, "Shall we try doing the vocal now?" And John said [disgruntled tone]: "Well that\'s what I\'m \'ere for." Then we went out into the studio, and he started howling his way through this, just a yell from beginning to end. It\'s like, "Christ almighty, how do we sort this one out? The fun really starts now."', 'We\'d already spent a long time putting the track down and overdubbing. So I went out there and said something to him, and he said, "Well, you\'re the one with the track record—you sort it out." I thought Fucking hell. I think he—and everybody—they were a bit bemused by what was expected of them by this time.', 'Once John had had a go at the vocals, he then became very involved in it all. They were really into making a great record, definitely. All this thing about being told to do the track without the singer, it made him out to be some fucking monster or something. It turns out he\'s totally into it. We ended up having to mix it through the night, pretty much. A lot of them were kipping upstairs. And John came down about five in the morning, he\'s listening to it and he\'s absolutely knocked out. "That\'s great," he said. "That\'s our anthem."', 'Did it seem special to you, or just another session?', 'BP: Chris and I were working on other projects at the same time. It was ostensibly like any other session, in that with any session you have to do whatever is required by the musician, by the band. Every session is a special case.', "Johnny Rotten was sort of anti-establishment—well, that was his guise. I don't think his true feelings were. But the whole image of the band was anti-establishment. And on a smaller scale, they were against the recognized process of recording. They were against the way the old fogeys went about things. They were against the institutions of major recording studios, of experienced engineers and good producers like Chris with his track record. Those things were part of the music business establishment, and it became Sex Pistols philosophy to be against it. They made that quite obvious, in no uncertain terms.", 'How did you know what they wanted? Did you have any preliminary discussions with them?', "BP: I hadn't seen them live, but as he said, Chris had. I'd heard a few demos, and I knew a three-piece always requires a lot of work with the sound, just because it can sound so small, so empty. The first time they came in the studio was the first time I'd met them.", 'Who played bass on those first sessions?', 'BP: I believe Glen [Matlock, bass] was there on the first recording we did of "Anarchy." I\'m a bit vague if he was there the second time we did it. Basically, what used to happen a lot of the time was Steve [Jones, guitar] used to play bass. So quite a lot of the time it was a two-piece. Quite often they used to play with just Steve and Paul [Cook, drums]. Steve would overdub the bass part as if it was another guitar part.', "When Sid [Vicious, bass] joined the band [in February 1977], I think he came for one session, and then I think he had hepatitis or jaundice for maybe a two-month period, which coincided with most of their recording period. So there weren't a lot of occasions when Sid was available to record anyway.", 'The Pistols were sacked by EMI in January \'77, after all the fuss in the press about swearing at Bill Grundy on TV and so on, but they move on, and the next single is "God Save The Queen." They were signed and then sacked by A&M in March, and signed to Virgin in May.', 'BP: Yes, my notes say Chris and I did that single here at Wessex on March 4, 1977. We did "EMI," "Did You No Wrong" [the b-side], "No Future" [a.k.a. "God Save The Queen"], and "Pretty Vacant." Glitterbest [Malcolm McLaren\'s company] paid for that. So that obviously represented a change in record company structure, shall we say [laughs].', 'The earlier sessions were paid for by EMI, presumably.', 'BP: They were direct EMI sessions, yes. EMI paid for the Dave Goodman recordings, as well, and for our original pair of "Anarchy" sessions.', 'I remember I had to go down to Pye studios with [mastering engineer] Malcolm Davies to re-cut "God Save The Queen." When seven-inch records are pressed, the master they\'re pressed from isn\'t seven inches—it\'s originally cut on to either a 10-inch or a 14-inch lacquer and reduced down at the factory. Some factories require a 10-inch lacquer and other factories require a 14-inch lacquer. Because of something like that Bill Grundy incident, the ladies at the factory had gone on strike and refused to put the record into the bag. So we had to go and re-cut to a different size lacquer so that it could be shifted to a different factory [laughs].', 'CT: I remember we did those four, including "God Save The Queen," in one afternoon. It was just Steve and Paul—and it\'s difficult to tell when you\'ve got just drums and guitar. No mistakes there, but you need the bass in there, or some more stuff, to find out if there\'s anything dodgy going on. But it just seemed fine, so we went on to the next one, and then the next one. Then I said to Steve, "Do you fancy putting the bass on, just so we know where we are?" I said to Bill, "Take this, in case there\'s a few good bits."', "Steve just played the root note of the chord all the way through, and it was great! I thought, That's it. And we did four backing tracks in an afternoon, literally in about two hours. Paul and Steve used to knock around together, and they'd go through the set probably five times a day, just the two of them. So they were completely locked in to this original guitar part and the drums—it just never altered, you know? That's why it was so fast. Bang! Done!", 'BP: The band came here to Wessex around that time, I think the same day as the A&M signing party, maybe to mix "God Save The Queen." They arrived in an A&M limo when the school-kids were on their break [at the school next door to Wessex studio]. Soon as the kids saw this limo, they clung at the fence trying to get over it—they didn\'t recognize the band, it was just the sight of the limo.', 'The school mistress came out, started screaming at the kids to get back in class. Johnny got out the car and told her, "Fuck off, you fascist old bastard!" She rang the police. She recognized the band! She must have used the word riot, because a Transit [van] full of about 14 police pulled up and bailed out.', "We tucked the band in a little studio round the back, and they fell asleep. They'd arrived with handfuls of sandwiches, half-drunk bottles of vodka in their pockets, sat down on the small couch in the studio and promptly fell asleep. So I entertained these policemen in number one control room for about half an hour—I'd been told to keep them occupied for a bit—on the premise that absolutely everybody is interested in how a 24-track recording desk works [laughs].", 'They appeared to be quite interested, so I just went down the channel strip, starting at the mic gain control, and explained to them how the desk worked. After about half an hour, six of them were still interested and didn\'t want me to stop. Eventually it was, "Well, doesn\'t seem to be much happening here," and they shuffled off.', 'The credit on the Bollocks album says "Produced by Chris Thomas or Bill Price." I don\'t think I\'ve seen an "or" credit like that before. Why is it like that?', "BP: That's to be taken quite literally.", 'CT: We\'d mixed "God Save The Queen" and that didn\'t come out, and we had "Pretty Vacant" and it was obvious that that wasn\'t gonna come out, so then I was going off to work on something else. That\'s when I suggested that Bill could carry on without me, because it had got to the point where they could just go in and record it, especially if it was minus Sid.', 'So I thought that Bill could do that—and he did about four or five songs on his own. That was the "or" credit. See if you can spot the difference! I don\'t think it would make any difference one way or the other.', "BP: I used to work a lot with Chris, and still do, as an engineer. What happened in this case was that in April '77 I started recording the album tracks, without Chris. Initially, there was absolutely no complication or difficulty about it at all.", "Chris had been contracted to do however many singles, and he wasn't in a position to be able to record the rest of the album. So Malcolm had a meeting with the band and myself and it was decided that I would record the album. And then Chris's singles tracks would be added to that. So it was very simple—initially.", 'Looking at my notes, I did "Problems," "No Feelings," "Liar," "17," "EMI," "Satellite," "New York," "Submission," and "Holidays In The Sun." Paid for by Glitterbest, and we worked for two or three weeks on those. And then Virgin started paying for things, after they signed the band [in May]. Chris then came in, and we started recording a new single, presumably to go out with the album. And this is when things started to get immensely complicated.', 'When did you record that potential single?', 'BP: That was June 11, 1977, for "Holidays In The Sun" and "Bodies." "Bodies" was different in that it\'s a song that was written after everything else—it was a new song, as opposed to the set that had been in existence since the band started.', 'CT: With "Bodies" I remember mentioning an orchestra, and maybe trying to do it live. I thought that would set the cat amongst the pigeons, to have the Royal Philharmonic. And then of course later they used strings on "My Way," which Bill did. But I was very happy with the way "Bodies" turned out, it was actually one of my favorites of the lot.', 'Bill, you said the album started to get complicated. What happened?', "BP: The album still had not been compiled. From that session in June until October, as well as making that single, I did versions of tracks that Chris had rejected as singles, which Chris had made as singles and hadn't been released, I'd done album versions of them. Some of the songs that I'd done on the album Chris had decided to record as potential singles.", 'And then this argument started between, I suppose, Johnny and Malcolm as to what should go on the album—how many tracks it should have, whether it should have all their previous singles on it, which versions, whose version, which recording of what songs.', "I must have made up that album about eight times. And I cut it three times with different running orders. I've got the test pressings, all with different orders, and I can't even remember which is the one that went out [laughs].", 'I remember arriving back from holiday, there was an announcement over the speakers at Victoria Station for me—it\'s a call from Malcolm [imitates Malcolm shouting:] "Have you got a pen and paper there? What we want is \'Anarchy\', \'17\' … !" And the lady who is now my wife wasn\'t at all pleased, because I had to go straight into the studio and work all night to put it in yet another order, and then go down the next morning to cut it. Again.', 'After that, we did some overdubbing at Air in London on "EMI," "Submission," and "Satellite," between August 8 and 12, 1977, with Sid playing bass. I seem to remember we did quite a lot of recording without Sid, because generally he was ill. Now he reappeared on the scene, so we put him on a few songs where he hadn\'t played on the original recordings—he wanted to be on it, being the bass player in the band. It became slightly arbitrary as to who was on the finished record, because the sound was a blend of something Sid had played and something Steve had played—you couldn\'t really credit either of them as the bass player on it.', 'CT: I remember the first time Sid came down to the studio, we had something set up, and he went up to the board, moved all the faders, said, "Is this where the music comes out?," or some stupid comment. Even the band sort of went, "Oh, fuck," you know? Not funny. That was the thing, you almost had to tolerate him.', 'What do you remember in particular about the process of recording?', "BP: Steve's guitar sound was very special, but I can't really give credit to anybody but Steve for that. He had a Fender Twin Reverb and he had a magic way of setting it—he turned all the knobs full up—and he had some very respectable Gibsons indeed, very good guitars. He had his own novel way of tuning a guitar, and his own novel chord shapes, and he instantly produced the Steve Jones sound. It was very easy to record.", "Steve had an immaculate sense of timing, and a lot of the Pistols riffs were his riffs. I'm not a guitar expert, and a lot of guitarists will say oh, I know where Jones got that one from or this one from, but they were always very obscure sources which I couldn't be sure about. As far as I was concerned, in terms of general music that most people had heard, they were all fairly original riffs. And Steve deserves a lot of credit for that.", 'Did Malcolm get involved in the recording?', "BP: At the start, Malcolm would be running to and fro, closeted with alternate members of the band quite frequently. But he was normally concerned about the vocals. He criticised the end results in a very non-technical and very helpful way, in that he would purely think of it as Johnny singing with a noise. And if there was a good point in the lyric, he didn't want that being missed, but neither did he want Johnny to sound like an arsehole stuck out on the top of something. He thought of it as singer and accompaniment. Which is a very good way to think of most records, actually.", 'The guitars and the drums sound especially good on the Pistols records.', "BP: With the drums, we did something that's fairly routine now but was maybe a bit special then. It relied on putting the drums fairly central in that big room at Wessex, separating everything else, and staggering mics at different distances from the drums. That means the sound of the drums arrives at successive microphones later in time.", "And in order to tighten up the front edge of that line, we then gated all of those microphones together. So you've got an instant attack from all of them, but a very muddled decay. It's a fairly standard technique now.", "We arrived at it between the two of us, not consciously copying anybody. There were a few David Bowie tracks we'd heard that on, that sounded as if they'd used that technique. It's one of those things where six different people invented it at about the same time. We sort of invented it ourselves, but I'm sure lots of other people were inventing it themselves, as well. You had to use a lot of elements, and you had lots of little things to fine-tune which were all interactive, until you got the sound you wanted. Changing one thing changed everything else. And it suited that band.", 'Did Paul appreciate that technique?', "BP: Paul started off almost totally incompetent, but very willing. He ended up like a fine rock drummer—by being really forced to work hard. It wasn't easy, that's for sure, getting drum tracks. Paul wasn't an experienced drummer, and he learned a hell of a lot in the course of being in the band. By the time I worked with him in The Professionals [Steve and Paul's post-Pistols band], Paul was a really superb, tight, rock-steady drummer.", "At the start, he had all these ideas, knew what he wanted to play and what he wanted to do, and that didn't change terribly much. But his facility to do three minutes of that, correctly, wasn't very good to start with. The hard work of the earlier sessions was getting a drum take together. Chris and I would do a lot of multitrack editing. That's how the drum tracks were achieved, with multitrack editing.", 'For example, the 19 takes of "Anarchy," plus occasional injections of tandoori chicken and Heineken and TV and pool—I think we spent longer editing it than the band took playing it. We would sit playing it back over and over and over again, three or four reels of tape—Chris and I would sit there making notes, trying to get some ideas.', 'In a three-minute song, we could do upwards of 20 multitrack edits on a two-inch tape. Sometimes there might just be two or three, depending on how good Paul was on that occasion, but sometimes it would be a very large number.', 'CT: That\'s exactly where I thought the problem lay on "Anarchy," with the drums. But it wasn\'t, because I think that was the only track we did with Glen. Then, when we jump ahead to the future stuff, when we started to work with Steve and Paul on their own, it was suddenly, "Hang on a minute, they played that and there was nothing wrong, take one—what?" In other words, the problem was between the bass–drums interplay.', 'So, we got a backing track down, then we did a lot of guitar overdubs, because I was interested in arranging the thing a fair bit. Steve already had a few ideas, and then we added a few more. There were a lot of guitar parts on "Anarchy," about 16 or something.', 'It seems the combination of Steve and Paul playing together formed the initial structure for a lot of the recordings you did.', "BP: Yes, for more or less everything. We'd probably start off using about 12 tracks of drums and one track of guitar, as a backing track. As the thing developed we'd shrink those drum tracks by mixing down to, say, six tracks, or discarding drum tracks that had been recorded that we didn't want to use.", 'Steve would add on a couple more basic guitar tracks to his original guitar track, maybe the same, maybe with subtle variations. Then we might do tracks picking out certain elements of the song, tuning the sound to suit those elements. So if Steve had some damped eight-in-the-bar sections, they would be laid down on the basic track, and then we would add an overdub where that very harmonic-y, damped sound was emphasized, in order to pick that element out. If there were any very open-chord sections, we might do single-note sections to pick out the bottom line. The elements within the original guitar part would be picked out and recorded on separate tracks, with the sound adjusted to suit that particular part of it.', 'Chris, it sounds like the band in general were becoming more interested and involved in the recording as time went on.', "CT: Definitely. In the studio, Steve, John, and Paul approached it quite seriously. If John wasn't doing anything, he might go off and get pissed, but if he came to do his vocal he wanted to do it good, and he took plenty of care over it. He was great to work with, actually. By this time they were a very frustrated rock 'n' roll band. They wanted to get out on the road and play, and they wanted their singles to come out.", "It was at that point that I started going off the boil a little bit as well, it just seemed pointless to make records, dash in, got to do this, got to do that—and then the thing doesn't come out. And the band were really cheesed off as well. Underneath it all was a very straightforward thing, where they were working hard to make a great record, enjoying that process, and wanting to see it come out and do well.", 'BP: At the start, Johnny in particular was more or less determined not to like anything, he\'d listen to any playback and say, "Well that sounds a pile of shit to me." He definitely wanted to be like that. But I do think his attitude wore off when he realized the band was being recorded and it was sounding quite good, and it was coming out of record players sounding like "Anarchy"—the job was being done. So I assume he sort of grudgingly accepted it.', 'Chris is a very good vocal producer, very good at getting performances out of people. I think possibly Johnny genuinely began to appreciate that he was in the hands of somebody who knew what he was doing when he started trying to get vocals down. I think that might have mellowed him a bit. It was all a little bit of a game, anyway.', "CT: And it's funny, because in some circles they're a very under-estimated band. Steve's great—he basically did everything. By the end, Steve was roaring, he definitely wanted to be a rock star by then. He was away, and he was doing a great job.", 'BP: Johnny did accept that he had to have professionals doing it. And that amateurs needed to be recorded by professionals. By the time we ended up putting the album together, I think his fight was with Malcolm and not with us, anyway. Things had changed a lot, I think, for Johnny over that period of time. The conflict was a bit more real. It was all a bit theoretical when he started.', "But as soon as the money started rolling in, I think the conflict had brass tacks involved. To be quite honest, I'm sure it was all about money. Malcolm started off as the jolly Svengali, and was somewhat shifty by the time they parted company.", 'Did you get paid?', 'BP: We got a certain amount of money, but because it was so chaotic it was not payment in the way record producers normally like to get paid, by auditable accounts, at all. An arbitrary sum of money changed hands.', "You said amateurs need to be recorded by professionals, Bill. How much of your work is with musicians who don't know much about being in a studio?", "BP: The majority of the studio business revolves around beginners. Most definitely. There's a hundred thousand bands in this world, and any recording studio, I'd say 90 percent of it is devoted to people the general public's never heard of. There's not many people that spend their time doing Elton John. I mean, I've done a lot of work with Elton, but that would be maybe six weeks of the year. The rest of the year I'd be working with people you've never heard of.", "The majority of money made by recording studios is on things that don't sell. It's unfortunate, but fair enough. I mean we're not all recording Fleetwood Mac all the time [laughs].", "Being good with people who aren't used to a studio is a very important part of working in a studio. To a certain extent, Johnny Rotten was right in having this attitude of not wanting to be shoved through a sausage machine like the regular process.", 'When you record people, you have to treat them as people. and if they\'re inexperienced, you have to take them through things gently. You don\'t want to go: "Ha ha ha, don\'t you know what that is? Oh, everybody knows that!" That attitude just doesn\'t work. Some people do that, but it\'s unprofessional. If a band walks into a professional recording studio, they\'re not expected to be experts in recording. They expect a service, and professionalism is a part of it.', 'Was it a happy experience, on the whole? Would you want to do something like that again?', "BP: Funnily enough, I was doing something almost exactly like it until about five o'clock this morning [in October 1984]. I'm working with a band called Ellery Bop, from Liverpool, who are fairly punky. They're looked after by Bill Drummond, and this is his latest signing, to WEA.", "The Pistols, though, it wasn't an unhappy album really. There's always personality conflicts in studios. There were no really heavy ones. I've had a lot heavier. Sid was never any great problem. I used to worry about him, not eating and stuff. I'd bring in pork pies, because he looked a bit skinny. Johnny wasn't too bad, either. A bit arty, a bit posey. The rest of them were fairly straight up Londoners.", 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

Our conclusion is inescapable: the early inhabitants of these caves must have gathered around the images for chanting or singing." - Ted Gioia, Music: A Subversive History', 'Caves, cathedrals, concert halls—wherever music is made, the space itself is a contributing player.', 'As Gioia writes in Music, there\'s reason to believe that the early humans who painted the Lascaux caves in modern-day France chose the site of their artwork and rituals exactly where the chambers would resonate the most. One can imagine the combined effect of the paintings, the firelight, and the reverberant chants, an overwhelming mix of sound, light, and movement. Steven Errede, a professor who studies the physics of music, has suggested these were the first "rock" concerts (pun his).', "Other old, though much less old, examples are the choral performances of Gregorio Allegri's Miserere in the 17th and 18th century Vatican, where the lead would direct his highest note to the most resonant spot of the Sistine Chapel. Since then, many choirs, opera singers, classical musicians, and countless others have learned to sing or perform in ways that complement the acoustics of a room, while acousticians have designed performance halls to heighten this sense of resonance.", 'This is reverb, traditionally speaking. But ask a musician creating rock, pop, hip-hop, or other contemporary music today what reverb is, and the things that come to mind probably aren\'t the effects of physical spaces. They\'re plugins and pedals or settings on an amplifier. So how\'d we get from actual halls and chambers to choosing "hall" or "chamber" at the flick of a dial?', "Reverb's Jim Tuerk and YouTube's Rob Scallon tackled the question in a nearly hour-long video, sharing the long and short of long and short tails, and taking us from natural reverb through plates, springs, pedals, and more.", "If you've ever recorded yourself in an untreated room like a garage or basement, you've probably encountered unflattering echoes. Maybe you didn't even notice while performing, but as you listen to the playback, the effect is glaring. You can hear the boominess of the room or the flutter of reverberations off the walls.", 'From the dawn of the recording age, this is a problem that professional recording studios have worked to solve through design, building materials, acoustic treatment, and expert mic placement. Live rooms that resonate just the right amount, vocal chambers with deadened walls, diffusers behind the mixing board—all of these are ways to control the reverberations that would otherwise roam untamed.', 'The reverb that remains is the sonic fingerprint of a studio. Spaces like Chess Records at 2120 South Michigan Avenue or the famously sloped floor at Sun Records imparted a certain character to any song that was made in them.', 'But once studios learned how to tame most of the naturally occurring echoes, producers and engineers wanted to add some back in, at their discretion.', 'The earliest artificial reverb effects were still empty rooms, but they were rooms built and used specifically for their echoes.', 'The origin story of echo chambers (or reverberation rooms) takes place at Universal Recording studio in Chicago. On a 1947 session for The Harmonicats\' "Peg o\' My Heart," Bill Putnam set up a speaker and a microphone in the studio\'s bathroom. Capturing the sound that reflected off the hard tile floor and walls, he then mixed that wet signal back in with the dry.', "This same basic idea was, thankfully, taken out of the bathroom and replicated. Sunset Sound, Abbey Road, Capitol Studios, and Motown are just a few of the famous studios whose echo chambers added space to beloved hits. In the same way that a concert hall's construction determines a certain sonic character, these echo chambers too impart a signature sound. And today, the specific sound of many of these famous rooms have been distilled into branded reverb plugins.", 'The earliest reverb machines to break free of a physical room were plate reverbs—though you still basically need a spare room to fit them.', "In the video above, you can see and hear a plate reverb at Chicago's Electrical Audio studio. A large sheet of metal suspended by clips, a plate reverb works by sending an audio signal to the plate and using pickups to record the affected signal. The sound reverberates through the metal sheet and decays.", 'The EMT 140 was the first commercially built plate reverb. Engineers gravitated toward them because of their ease of use and the greater amount of control they offered when compared to echo chambers. They also have their own unique sound, with a bright attack and a decay that darkens as it gets quieter. For that reason, "plate reverb" is a common setting on any number of digital pedals and reverb plugins today.', "However, full-sized plate reverbs are the size of a small car and are sensitive to the sounds and vibrations around them. (For this reason, Electrical Audio keeps its plate reverb deep in the basement.) They can also be quite expensive to buy on the vintage market. So for musicians looking to add reverb to their individual instruments, plate reverbs are entirely impractical. But that's where spring reverbs enter the soundscape.", "The first instrument to come with its own supply of reverb was the Hammond organ, but it wasn't until the Hammond spinoff company Accutronics created the Type 4 spring reverb that it became available as a standalone unit.", 'The idea really took off in popular music, however, once Leo Fender built the Fender Reverb Tank and started to add them into his line of amplifiers like the Vibroverb and Twin Reverb. You can hear these spring reverbs getting a workout all over early \'60s surf rock, with Dick Dale\'s "Misirlou" being the primary example of how spring reverb can transform a riff.', "A spring reverb works in a way that's similar to a plate reverb. Instead of a sheet of metal, however, the original sound is sent through springs (sometimes a single spring, but usually two or more). While this allows spring units to be relatively small and easily added to amplifier chassis, it also means the sound is very different from plates or echo chambers: brighter, thinner, and, well, more springy.", "For this reason, while it sounds great on guitars and can sound great with other instruments, it's not usually the first choice in recording studios when engineers think about treating a mix... that is, unless it's an AKG BX20.", "This overbuilt, large format spring reverb acts differently than the spring reverbs you find in an amplifier. The springs are bigger, there are more of them, and it sounds more lush and full than the traditional boing of a spring. Because of that, the teak-wood box of the BX20, BX10, and BX15 from the '70s can be found in virtually every professional studio.", "The thrill of using springs in non-standard, unexpected ways has driven the creation of a number of new devices. Gamechanger Audio's Light Pedal combines spring reverb with infrared optical sensors, which catch and allow you to experiment with additional harmonics and noise from its reverb tank. And the desktop KNAS Ekdahl Moisturizer keeps the springs exposed, so that you can manipulate them directly.", 'In 1976, EMT took what it learned from its plate reverbs and its smaller diaphragm-based EMT 240 and created the EMT 250, the first digital reverb unit. With four levers and a row of buttons on top of a large paper-shredder-like enclosure, it looks far different from what digital reverbs would become, but you could set decay times, treat high and low frequencies with different amounts of reverb, and add other effects as well.', 'As digital outboard gear progressed, digital reverbs were more commonly built as rackmount units or as algorithms within multi-effects. Different boxes rose and fell from popularity, with these digital reverbs helping to define eras and mini-eras within pop music just as analog reverbs defined previous ones.', 'The prime example of this is the AMS RMX16 Digital Reverberation System. One of its many algorithms was the "Non Lin 2"—a gated reverb that gave the Phil Collins\' "In the Air Tonight" drum sound to whatever audio you sent through it. Prince, Kate Bush, Hall & Oates, Duran Duran, and many other famous artists used the effect throughout the \'80s, to the point where any use of it now is automatically a sonic throwback to that time.', "Today, of course, digital reverbs don't even need rack space.

The Tokyo-based group used synthesizers, drum machines, and other electronic hardware to create a body of work that is still lauded to this day for its combination of catchy melodies, tight rhythms, and experimental drive.', 'What is less talked about, however, is the gear they used and, specifically, how they put it all together to create a music that few had attempted before.', "The history of the band's gear-use is also a history of the development of synthesizers and other electronic instruments. The band's first vital period of work spanned the late 1970s, when American companies dominated synth manufacturing, through the 1980s, with the rise of Japanese companies like Korg and Roland. But the band's story also brings in new developments in digital sampling, types of synthesis, and music recording.", 'Right on the cutting edge (and often even out in front of it), YMO were never shy to embrace new technologies, and this informed their musical output.', "Let's take a look at the history of the band through their gear.", 'The YMO story starts with Haruomi Hosono. By the late 1970s, Hosono had already been active in the Japanese music scene for a decade, having played in rock bands Apryl Fool and the very successful Happy End and was then in the midst of a solo career, releasing a string of quirky albums that indulged his passion for Tin Pan Alley and exotica, the post-World War musical genre popular in the United States that substituted the reality of Pacific locales for an imagined tropical island life. It was the latter that would lead to the formation of Yellow Magic Orchestra.', 'Paraiso, released in the spring of 1978, saw Hosono getting deep into Hawaiian and Okinawan-flavored exotica. To bring his vision to life, he needed some session musicians, and so he called in drummer Yukihiro Takahashi, formerly of the Sadistic Mika Band, who had toured the UK with Roxy Music. Also making the session scene at the time was university student Ryuichi Sakamoto, who came on board for a few songs.', 'While not a strictly electronic affair, the album does use an ARP Odyssey (a firm future YMO favorite) and the then-cutting-edge (and still pretty mind-blowing) Yamaha CS-80. Hosono dubbed his backing group the Yellow Magic Band and the seeds were sown for future greatness. The three would work again on Hosono\'s Pacific (also 1978), which featured an early version of "Cosmic Surfin\'," later re-recorded for YMO\'s self-titled debut.', "Released only a month before the YMO debut, Ryuichi Sakamoto's own debut solo album, Thousand Knives, is worth a mention as it features quite a few of the same pieces of gear—as well as the playing techniques—that would be heard on YMO's inaugural release.", 'Teetering on the line between avant-garde and pop, Thousand Knives features three songs later redone by YMO in various ways: "Plastic Bamboo," "The End Of Asia," and the title track, which would eventually feature prominently on 1981\'s BGM. The complexity of the harmonies on the record earned Sakamoto the nickname of Professor.', 'Thousand Knives the album featured a number of the top synthesizers of the day: Moog Minimoog and Micromoog, Korg VC-10 Vocoder and SQ-10 sequencer, and Pollard Syndrum.', 'Although polyphonic synths were still in their infancy, the album features two, an Oberheim Eight Voice (soon to be a staple of their live show) and a Korg PS-3100, a fully polyphonic and accordingly bank-breaking synth.', 'The album is also notable for the appearance of programmer Hideki Matsutake, who would come to be known as the unofficial fourth member of YMO. A former apprentice of Moog modular master Isao Tomita, he was brought in to play his Moog IIIc and program the Roland MC-8 sequencer.', 'Released in 1977, the MC-8 was the first microprocessor-controlled CV/gate sequencer and a huge step up from the eight and 16-note step sequencers available at the time. It had eight CV/gate outputs for note and filter control and was even capable of polyphonic sequencing.', '"I used to know Ikutaro Kakehashi, who is the developer and founder of Roland," Matsutake told the website Stereoklang. "So I… purchased [an MC-8] on the day of public commercial launch at an ordinary music instrument shop. At that time I could not play a keyboard so I had been looking for something to replace it. The MC-8 was exactly such an automated instrument. It created the sound of the future."', 'Notes could ostensibly be played in live but this was apparently difficult to achieve so most users—including Matsutake—input note information in the form of numerical data via an adding machine-like keypad. For each note, the machine required a number to indicate note position on the keyboard as well as timing and gate length.', '"I don\'t think you need a good mathematical brain [to use the MC-8]," he explained in an interview with Electricity Club. "Maybe some rudimentary arithmetic helps—addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. You need to be able to work these out quickly. Plus, touch-typing skills are vital. Remember, you need to enter three parameters to program a single note so you\'ve got to be quick yet accurate. I practiced a lot."', 'The MC-8 would be a major contributor to the future sound of Yellow Magic Orchestra.', 'Hosono convinced Sakamoto and Takahashi to join him, and Yellow Magic Orchestra was born. Their first hit, a cover of Martin Denny\'s "Firecracker" and an extension of the exotica sound that Hosono explored on Paraiso and Pacific, set the tone for their self-titled debut album: largely instrumental electronic music informed as much by Kraftwerk as by traditional Asian-style melodies.', 'Their rhythmic power came from two sources: the drumming of Yukihiro Takahashi, and the MC-8 programming of Hideki Matsutake, now firmly ensconced in the studio with the band. Takahashi used regular drums and augmented them with a Pollard Syndrum Quad, playing to a click track provided by the MC-8. This would be at the heart of their sound until the TR-808 arrived in 1980. The rhythmic combination of tight yet funky resulted in "Firecracker" getting plays by hip-hop DJs like Afrika Bambaataa and helped the album climb into the Billboard Top 200 and R&B Album charts.', 'As with Thousand Knives, Yellow Magic Orchestra again featured the Korg PS-3100 and VC-10 vocoder, ARP Odyssey and Minimoog, and Oberheim Eight Voice. The CS-80 was replaced by a Moog Polymoog. Given that Sakamoto used the Polypedal controller on their first world tour, we can probably assume he also employed it for the album.', 'To capitalize on their growing popularity, the band embarked on a world tour that saw them play at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles. The performance was recorded and later released on video and DVD, and on various albums. In 2014, the entire stage rig was recreated at the Tokyo International Exhibition Center. Here is a breakdown of the gear they had on stage with them at the time according to the exhibition.', 'Facing the stage, at the front left was Sakamoto and his keyboards, which included a Roland VP-330 Vocoder Plus and Polymoog and Polypedal controller. On top of the Polymoog were two ARP Odysseys, one Revision 2 and one Revision 3. He also had a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5. Behind him in his effects rack, a Yamaha Analog Delay E1010 is clearly visible. He also had a Roland RE-201 Space Echo and Dimension D SDD-320 chorus rack, and an MXR Stereo Chorus.', 'To the right of Sakamoto was Takahashi, playing a drum kit consisting of a Pollard Syndrum Quad and ULT-Sound DS-4, along with traditional acoustic drums.', 'On the front right was Hosono, playing a Music Man bass guitar and an ARP Odyssey revision 2 for synth basslines.', 'Live, YMO filled out their sound with additional musicians. On this tour, this included Kazumi Watanabe on guitar, Akiko Yano on Prophet-5 and Oberheim Eight Voice, and the ever-present Hideki Matsutake, whose station was dominated by his towering Moog IIIc. He also had a Boss DR-55 drum machine, Musitronics Mu-Tron Bi-Phase, Yamaha Analog Delay E1010, Moog Ten Band Graphic Equalizer, and Sequential Circuits Model 700 Programmer, a sequencer with envelope controls made to run ARP and Moog synths.', "Additionally, Matsutake was in charge of keeping two Roland MC-8s running and had a stack of cassettes and two cassette players to load songs from, something that didn't always work perfectly. In fact, Roland's engineers were apparently surprised that YMO used MC-8s live, given that they were only designed for studio use.", '"You just could not predict what would go wrong," Matsutake told Electricity Club. "Luckily, the MC-8 only stopped twice during live performances. When that happened, everyone in the band knew there was nothing I or anyone could do, so the rest of the musicians went ahead and played without the sequenced parts."', 'While this setup certainly represented the cream of the crop of electronic instruments at the time, the paucity of Japanese instruments and reliance on American gear is noteworthy. Japan had not yet become the electronic instrument powerhouse it would in the 1980s.', 'In 1979, the band returned to the studio to lay down the tracks for their second album, Solid State Survivor. Gone were the exotica and disco sounds, replaced by more up-to-date strains. They had been listening to new wave bands like Devo, and this is apparent on the angular cover of The Beatles\' "Day Tripper."', 'Less is known about the gear used on this album, although Matsutake and his MC-8 were definitely present. The album also featured a Roland VP-330 Vocoder Plus, which can be heard on the opener, "Technopolis" (and on the next album, Multiplies, as well). It\'s also safe to assume that the band had a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 on hand, given that the band had two in their live rig that year.', "By their third album, BGM, YMO were firmly way out ahead of everyone else, at least in terms of access to the latest musical technology. The album was recorded on a then-brand-new digital 3M 32-track recorder (which Hosono hated for its brittle sound). The album also featured one of the first recordings of a Roland TR-808. The band had debuted a prototype version of the famous drum machine live in Japan in 1980, thanks no doubt to Matsutake's close association with Roland founder Ikutaro Kakehashi.", 'Their venerable MC-8 was replaced by a new Roland MC-4, which Hosono found much easier to program, often doing it himself live with a Prophet-5. While by all accounts more user-friendly than its predecessor, the MC-4, released in 1981, was still rather cryptic compared to modern sequencers (Aphex Twin apparently likened it to "making tracks on a taxi meter"). It also wasn\'t as robust as the MC-8, with only four sets of CV/gate outputs.', "On the back cover of the original vinyl release of BGM, the band printed a huge grocery list of gear, including synthesizers, effects, and even keyboard stands. While often erroneously assumed to be the studio bill for BGM, this is in fact the customs declaration for their second world tour. While much is the same as the kit list for the Greek Theater show, it does have a few notable additions, including more Prophet-5s, a Roland Jupiter-4, and Matsutake's new E-Mu Modular System.", '"I purchased an E-Mu Modular System in the autumn of 1980 before the start of the second YMO World Tour," he told Stereoklang. "It was because I needed a new quality of sound that was different from the Moog III. Compared with the thick, soft sounds of the Moog III, the E-Mu Modular System has a distinctive solid and metallic sound. It produced a very good contrast when used together with the Moog III… The design was also futuristic and sophisticated, making me feel excited just by looking at it."', 'Live, it was used in the intro to Sakamoto\'s solo cut, "Riot In Lagos," which entered the YMO concert repertoire around that time. It can also be heard on Matsutake\'s second solo album under the name Logic titled Venus (1981).', 'While sampling was starting to catch on in the West, thanks to the Fairlight CMI, there was no Japanese equivalent for YMO to experiment with. Yet.', "Thanks to their inside connections, the band was able to get ahold of the Toshiba LMD-649, a prototype sampler and reportedly the first 12-bit PCM drum machine/sampler. It's all over Technodelic, the band's follow-up to BGM. It was used in a largely percussive way, likely due to its intended use as a drum machine rather than a chromatic sampler.", 'Hosono would continue to experiment with sampling, soon buying an E-Mu Emulator and using it on his later solo albums, such as Philharmony (1982).', 'Although YMO would officially break up in 1983, they would continue to occasionally reform to release new music and tour. Through it all, they stayed up-to-date on the latest musical technology, adopting FM and sample-based synthesis as they came along.', 'All three members are still active in music, with Sakamoto releasing challenging electronic music and soundtracks (as well as pretty much every other genre imaginable), Takahashi revisiting his past work, and Hosono eventually returning to Tin Pan Alley music.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Perhaps you’re not so picky and would be happy to own anything played (or even touched) by Prince.', 'Unfortunately, many of us may never have the opportunity to own the gear played by our biggest influences. But a lot of rockstars have. Here are a few examples of times musicians bought gear that once belonged to the heroes who shaped them.', 'Rock and folk icon Neil Young may be best known for his ‘53 Les Paul, but another famous guitar in his collection is a 1941 Martin D-28 that was previously owned by the legendary country singer and songwriter Hank Williams.', 'Of course, Neil didn’t purchase the guitar directly from Williams, who died in 1953 when Young was just eight years old. Instead, he purchased it from friend-of-a-friend Tut Taylor.', 'He’s even loaned it out to other famous friends from time-to-time. Most notably, he loaned it to Bob Dylan when Dylan was also borrowing Young’s tour bus.', "It's worth noting that there is some speculation that Young got taken on his purchase, since Williams played a 1944 D-28 that is on display at the Country Music Hall of Fame. However, there's no reason to believe Williams ever owned just one, and his son, Hank Williams Jr, has reportedly verified that Young's was one of his father's.", 'Session musician Waddell "Waddy" Wachtel is best known for his work with Linda Ronstadt, Stevie Nicks, The Rolling Stones, Jackson Browne, and more. He even had a signature guitar released for the Collector’s Choice series from Gibson.', 'The special signature was modeled after his beloved 1960 Les Paul that he purchased for $350 from one of his musical heroes—Stephen Stills.', 'One of the greatest guitar-related headlines of all time might be Guitar World’s “Kirk Hammett: ‘Jimmy Page Told Me to Buy Peter Green’s Les Paul.’”', "This Burst has changed hands often throughout its life. It was famously owned and played by Gary Moore after Green, as well as several collectors before Hammett. (One of those collectors, Melvyn Franks, was the owner when Gibson created the Collector's Choice #1 Reissue of the guitar.) But when it was Hammett's time, rather than pursuing this particular 1959 Les Paul Standard like Hammett normally does with gear, the dealer called him.", 'Hammett of course knew the guitar and its story, and he also knew the hefty price tag. Though he was interested, he wasn’t sure about making the purchase. So he messaged friend and guitar god Jimmy Page to ask him what he thought. Page’s reaction? “Buy it.” The rest is history.', 'Another case of the guitar finding the rockstar is Dan Auerbach and Mississippi Fred McDowell’s Gibson Trini Lopez.', 'Mississippi Fred McDowell was an early blues guitar legend and was renowned for his slide playing. One of his beloved guitars was a Gibson Trini Lopez, which has found its way into the possession of modern blues rocker and enormous McDowell fan Dan Auerbach from The Black Keys.', 'Auerbach was contacted by a person in St. Louis who’d gotten hold of the guitar that he’d seen so many times in classic Alan Lomax VHS tapes. “It was crazy,” he told Vintage Guitar, “I used to stare at it in those videos. I never forgot the little jewels glued to the headstock and upper bout. It was just wild, you know?” After some negotiations (and apparently a terrible poker face on Auerbach’s part), the guitar became part of his permanent collection.', 'It might not seem groundbreaking to hear that French indie band Phoenix recorded their 2013 album Bankrupt! on a Harrison 4032 solid-state recording console. But you’d probably change your mind when you learned the console was the same one used on the best-selling album of all time—Michael Jackson’s Thriller—as well as dozens more from artists like Donna Summer, Billy Idol, and Paul McCartney.', 'Apparently Phoenix guitarist Laurent Brancowitz saw the console listed for sale on eBay of all places. According to The New Yorker, the band “liked the idea of working with a consecrated artifact, as well as having something strange upon which to fixate between albums.” Phoenix talked “spooky” and “pushy” seller Clayton Rose down from his $32,000 asking price (the original asking price was one million dollars just after Jackson’s death) to $17,000 and had him ship it to Paris for the Bankrupt! recording sessions.', 'One of the more recently acquired guitars on this list started with Ed King of seminal Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd. King, who passed away in August 2018, infamously played on songs like “Sweet Home Alabama” and “Saturday Night Special.”', 'After he died, part of his collection landed at Carter Vintage Guitars in Nashville, Tennessee. According to Guitar Player, co-owner Christie Carter asked Jason Isbell to come by and play some of King’s guitars for the shop’s YouTube channel. Isbell saw the fabled ‘59 Les Paul (nicknamed Red Eye), which had famously been stolen in 1987 and recovered a decade later. By the time Isbell left the shop, he had Ed King’s Les Paul with him.', 'Bush singer and ‘90s rock god Gavin Rossdale’s New York Magazine feature “What Musician Gavin Rossdale Can’t Live Without” is mostly full of toiletries and kitchen gadgets, but the guitar he acquired after he inked his first record deal—a purple 1960s Fender Jazzmaster—managed to make this exclusive list. “When I bought it, they told me it had been Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh’s guitar,” he told New York Magazine.', 'Years later, Rossdale met Walsh and asked him to confirm what he thought might have been a tall tale. Instead, Walsh said that not only had the guitar previously been his, but that it had been used to lay down the rhythm guitar parts with it to The Eagles’ most recognizable song, “Hotel California."', 'B-benders, a contraption installed in a guitar to help six-string players emulate pedal steel sounds, are already a rarity. But Byrds and Gram Parsons guitarist, the late Clarence White, was the first to employ this unique technology, created for him by drummer Gene Parsons.', 'Though Clarence tragically died in 1973, when then-child prodigy Marty Stewart was just 15 years old, Stuart had the pleasure of meeting Clarence once before then, through his brother and bandmate Roland White.', 'Stuart considered the White family to be like family—after all, Roland had gotten Stuart his first job with Lester Flatt when Stuart was only 13. So when Clarence White’s widow, Susie, was selling some of her late husband’s things, she offered the famous b-bender Telecaster to Stuart.', 'That’s not all Stuart, who was initially just interested in a Stratocaster, walked away with. For under $1,450, Stuart obtained the B-bender Telecaster, the Stratocaster, Byrds memorabilia, and some Nudie suits.', 'Most of the guitars featured in this article are of guitarists buying gear once played by their heroes. In this case, the guitar was sold to the guitar hero. “You know, I sold Jeff Beck the second Les Paul he ever owned,” Nielsen told MusicRadar. “It was a ’59 that had a Bigsby on it… If you look close, you can see where it used to be. I traded a Gibson SG and $25 for it. I have pictures of me with him, Buddy Guy and Stevie Ray Vaughan 10 years after selling him that guitar.”', 'Joe Bonamassa is one of the world’s foremost guitarists and collectors, so it should be no surprise he’s purchased some historically significant gear. One of those is a gold Fender Stratocaster previously owned by Eldon Shamblin, most known for his work with Bob Wills. In 2016, Bonamassa told Tulsa World that the Shamblin Stratocaster is in the top five off his 260-plus guitar collection.', 'Wilco’s Nels Cline is known for Jazzmasters, but his first bass was purchased from American hardcore legend Mike Watt, bassist for Minutemen, Dos, and fIREHOSE. "I\'ve broken virtually everything on it at some point except for the knobs and the pickups," Cline told Spin Magazine in 2011. The ‘59 Jazzmaster is one of Cline’s most prized guitars and boasts an enviable relic.', 'Original Elvis Presley bassist Bill Black had a short but substantial legacy. He was with Presley since the beginning of Elvis’ career and performed with his own group, The Bill Black Combo. Other than performing with Elvis, The Bill Black Combo were asked by The Beatles themselves to open for the Fab Four on their first-ever tour of the United States following their historic Ed Sullivan performance.', 'It’s fitting then that Paul McCartney would later own Black’s main upright bass. In the late 1970s, Paul’s wife Linda gave the ex-Beatle the bass as a birthday gift. McCartney has put the bass to good use over the years, even performing with it on television specials.', "Despite its serial number, David Gilmour's 0001 Stratocaster isn’t the first-ever Stratocaster made.

'https://reverb.com/shop/marks-gear-bazaar-937'], ['Japan is famous the world over for its musical instruments and hardware. Roland, Korg, and Yamaha are some of the most respected musical instrument manufacturers in the world, with products that are well built and—more often than not—pretty good value for the money. With all three manufacturers cranking out top-quality products, you might be surprised to learn that Japan has an entirely separate domestic market of instruments and hardware that was never intended for export. And, unlike other domestic markets like that of the former Soviet Union, the rest of the world has yet to tap fully into the local Japanese market.', "Japan is a unique place. Although it has a relatively small landmass, the country has a rather large population. At roughly 127 million, it's the 11th largest in the world. It's also a wealthy nation, with the world's third largest economy. Add these to a love for music and a passionate hobby culture and you end up with a large consumer base with money to spend on musical instruments and gear. With import prices being high (Japan is an island nation on the other side of the world from America and Europe), it makes sense that domestic companies would step in to satiate the needs of music-loving Japanese. This was particularly true of the era from the 1960s to the end of the 1980s, when Japan experienced huge economic growth coupled with an increase in the number of young people.", "A surprising aspect of Japanese domestic music gear is the tendency for the company names to not sound Japanese. With names like Elk, Hawk, Evans, and Vesta Fire, you'd be forgiven for thinking they were American or European companies. This was likely the point, at least as far as it concerned Japanese consumers. With most popular music coming from overseas and anything foreign being cool, it's no surprise that local companies went out of their way to sound exotic.", "Since audio gear from this time period is plentiful in Japan, why hasn't it caught on in the West like other gear? There are a few factors at play here. Shipping from Japan is expensive, for one. There's also the language barrier. Unlike Europe, Japanese people tend to not speak English and so prefer to sell domestically. This has kept the lid on Japanese domestic gear, but with so much amazing stuff out there, it's time to shine a light on the world of Japanese domestic gear.", "For those who do make the plunge and buy from Japan, you're likely to find gear that is in excellent condition, even 40 or 50 years after manufacture. These machines were also exceedingly well made, and while anything this old may require occasional maintenance, they are usually still in good working order.", "Let's look at some of the highlights of gear available from Japan. Many of the pieces mentioned here are available through the shop Vintage Audio Nagoya. Stick around for an interview with the shop as well.", "Most everyone is familiar with Roland's line of Space Echo tape echo units. While they are undeniably incredible, they're only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Japanese echo machines. It's almost as if there was an overwhelming need for vocal echo machines. Well, actually, there was.", 'The 1970s was the start of the karaoke boom in Japan and you just had to have an echo unit as part of your karaoke rig at the time. This included Space Echo–style tape units as well as cheaper 8-track cassette units for the less successful watering holes. As a result of all this inebriated singing, there are plenty of unique tape echoes around.', 'There were plenty of effects made for the Japanese domestic market in the 1970s and 1980s, both stomp boxes and tabletop units. They run the gamut from distortion and chorus to bucket brigade analog delay. Here are some examples.', "Producers and musicians are starting to catch on to the power of 1970s mixers for adding warmth and character. They're great for dirtying up a signal or summing mix buses or entire mixes through. Vintage Yamaha EM series mixers are pretty incredible, and the Boss KM-60 is also worth a look. There are plenty others available as well.", "Poke around Japanese thrift stores and antique shops enough and you'll come across plenty of PA mixers. Most have built-in EQ and spring reverb, and some even have delays (or at least delay sends).", "Everyone knows the Roland TR series of drum machines (TR-808, TR-909, etc.) but there's plenty more to be found in Japan if you dig a little deeper. This is doubly true when you go back to the 1970s and the era of the rhythm machine, preset boxes meant to add rhythm accompaniment to organs.", 'Lastly, we asked Vintage Audio Nagoya owner Mark Oman about his passion for Japanese domestic audio gear, and for any tips on buying it.', 'Have you noticed any difference between Japanese domestic audio gear and overseas gear?', "I'm mainly into vintage gear. I grew up with Fender, Marshall and Peavey in the USA but have really gotten into Japanese brands. I'm a huge fan of Ace Tone, Roland, and Guyatone stuff. I really admire the build quality of the late-'60s/early-'70s Japanese gear.", "What's your favorite piece of Japanese domestic gear?", "It's probably the Roland RE-201. I have lost control of my tape echo addiction and that was a big contributor.", "What's the most unusual piece of gear you've come across?", "I am always searching for tape echoes and I can't name just one. Japan had so many small, independent companies making tape echoes in the 1970s. I keep finding amazing echo machines of all shapes and sizes.", 'Do you find that Japanese gear generally has been well-taken care of?', 'Yes, typically vintage Japanese gear is in good condition. Some items suffer from rust issues, and it seems a lot of people smoked around the older equipment.', "What's something that people should keep in mind when ordering gear from Japan?", "Just realize that shipping is expensive and returning items is cost prohibitive in many cases. So be sure you know what you're getting before you buy it. Also most Japanese items work fine in America but other countries with higher voltage will need transformers.", "Is there anything else you'd like people to know about Japanese domestic audio gear?", "I scour all the recycling shops, antique stores, junk shops, etc., and almost every day I find something I've ever seen before. There are so many hidden vintage gems in Japan.

Though it was with a bass and on a country record, the sound nevertheless came roaring through radios in the form of The Rolling Stones\' "Satisfaction" soon enough, remaking rock guitar in the process.', "Except, how did the fuzz effect become standardized? How did a recording console's defective circuitry come to be replicated, made controllable, and packaged into a convenient pedal? That's where Nancy Sinatra comes in.", 'After Robbins\' "Don\'t Worry" became a hit, "People were calling in to find out what it was," Snoddy told NAMM in 2014. "They couldn\'t understand what this sound was."', "The novelty spread through Nashville, with everyone wanting a bit of the console's fuzz on their own records. But it wasn't until that well ran dry that the fuzz found its footing.", "At the time, effects units took many forms. One of the earliest boxes was DeArmond's Tremolo Control, available around 1941, but the box was not for stomping. More like a small metal lunch pail, the Tremolo Control was a desktop unit, complete with a handle on top.", "Reverb units like Fender's original Reverb Tank housed its electro-mechanical springs and pickup in an amp-like cabinet. No standalone distortion or overdrive effect had yet been invented—with guitarists merely cranking amps or taking matters into their own hands to slice speaker cones for dirtier sounds.", "Because Snoddy's original fuzz tone was a byproduct of bad electronics, there was always an expiration date. One day, the Quonset Hut mixer's faulty circuitry finally gave way for good.", '"We had an artist, Nancy Sinatra, that called and wanted to come in and make a record. When she got there, we had to tell her that the console that was causing that sound, the amplifier had quit, and we couldn\'t do it anymore. They didn\'t like that at all. [Laughs.] I told [Quonset Hut owner and producer] Harold Bradley that I\'d have to see if I could make one and get it going."', 'So it was because of Sinatra—the pop scion whose "These Boots Were Made Walkin\'" was released in 1965—that Snoddy called Revis Hobbs, intent on achieving the console\'s sound, which had been the result of a transformer, through transistors instead.', 'Snoddy and Hobbs placed the circuitry in a wedge-shaped pedal, encapsulating the fuzz tone in what was now officially the Fuzz-Tone, sold under Gibson\'s Maestro brand, first as the FZ-1 and then as the FZ-1A. While others worked in parallel to create a similar effect—Orville Rhodes\' handmade fuzzbox propelled the guitar of The Ventures\' "2000 Pound Bee"—it was the Maestro Fuzz-Tone that Keith Richards managed to get his hands on.', '"Satisfaction," became, well, "Satisfaction." The fever for fuzz pedals was well and truly lit. And who knows if any of it would\'ve happened, or happened the same way, if Nancy Sinatra hadn\'t simply asked.', "This story is told in Reverb's The Pedal Movie, our documentary film that covers the past, present, and future of effects.

On his lap sat an iridescent Gibson ES-150 guitar, its black pickup a scar across its midsection, a twisted cord dangling impertinently from its lower bout. The boxy Gibson EH-150 amplifier next to his chair emitted a low unsettling hum.', "The bandleader had met the guitarist, a 23-year-old named Charlie Christian, earlier in the day when Goodman's brother-in-law, the impresario John Hammond, brought the youngster over to Columbia Studios in Hollywood. Benny had been unimpressed then, and he now realized that Hammond had set the kid up on stage during the break to force an audition.", "With the 10:00 pm set about to begin and the house packed with eager swing fans, Goodman had no choice but to allow the garishly clad guitarist to sit in. He promptly called for 'Rose Room,' a tune of 1917 vintage that he was sure the Midwesterner wouldn't know. After three fleet choruses, Benny passed the lead over to Christian.", 'Turning up the gain on his electric Gibson, Christian improvised his way through a first chorus with stunning ease, demonstrating that he not only knew the tune but knew it well. His amplified sound had an uncanny horn-like timbre, and his phrases cut through the din of the rhythm section like a knife through butter. He took another chorus, building on the first, and then another. After 20 more, he brought his solo to a triumphant conclusion, electrifying the room with his electric guitar.', "The audience, stunned, rewarded him with uproarious applause, and immediately following the set on that August evening in 1939, a chastened Benny Goodman hired Charlie Christian to complete the bandleader's newly formed sextet.", "It was the guitarist's big break, and after years of touring in near anonymity with territory bands, he would soon be known nationally and internationally as a pioneer of the electric guitar, and one of jazz's greatest soloists. But while Charlie Christian was one of the first jazz musicians to play an amplified instrument, he wasn't the very first.", "That honor might belong to Eddie Durham. Like Christian, Durham was born in Texas, and he had made his way to Kansas City, Missouri, after playing in his family's band and in various circus orchestras and minstrel show outfits. In KayCee, he joined Bennie Moten's dance orchestra, doubling on trombone and guitar. On the former instrument he had no trouble being heard, but the 11-piece band often drowned whatever sounds he could produce on guitar. He quickly realized he needed some way to increase the instrument's volume.", 'Using a National resonator guitar, Durham found that by holding its metal diaphragm up to a microphone, he could amplify the instrument enough so that he could be heard over the band. But it was awkward having to jump up and come down to the PA mic at the front of the stage whenever it was time for a solo. So he soon rigged up his own mic and a small amp made from an old radio, which meant he could solo right from his seat.', 'By 1935, Durham was using a commercially-made pickup, a DeArmond bar-style "guitar microphone," clamped to an acoustic guitar. "I made an attachment where I could play into the sound system," Durham told Douglas Henry Daniels in the book One O\'clock Jump. Durham was using that rig with the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra when he encountered Charlie Christian in Oklahoma City in 1937.', 'He recalled that Christian wasn\'t playing guitar. The younger musician was playing piano, but when he heard what Eddie was doing, Christian decided to switch instruments. "He had big eyes to sound like a saxophone," Eddie continued, and he showed the Oklahoman a few tricks for getting a horn-like sound out of an electric instrument. "Man, I never saw a fellow learn so fast, nor have I ever seen anyone rise to the top so quickly," Durham said. "The next thing I knew, Christian was a star with the Benny Goodman band!"', 'Before Charlie Christian hooked up with the King of Swing in Beverly Hills, though, he spent time on the road with the Alphonse Trent Orchestra, a small group based out of Kansas City. While Trent was performing in Bismarck, North Dakota, a young woman came to see the band, having heard about the guitarist who was amazing audiences with his amplified sound.', "Seventeen-year-old Mary Osborne thought she was hearing a tenor saxophone soloing when she first entered the club, but then realized that the sound was coming from Christian's plugged-in Gibson.", '"I remember hearing some of the figures Charlie played in his solos," Osborne told Al Avakian and Bob Prince for their liner notes to the 1955 album Charlie Christian With The Benny Goodman Sextet and Orchestra. "They were exactly the same things that Benny recorded later as \'Flying Home,\' \'Gone With "What" Wind,\' \'Seven Come Eleven,\' and all the others."', 'Osborne was so inspired by Christian\'s playing that she sought him out after the gig, and they briefly jammed together while Christian offered her tips on technique and shared musical ideas. He also told her where in town she could find a Gibson ES-150 and amp like his, and when Osborne visited the store a few days later, she found the guitar displayed in the window with a sign that read "As played by Charlie Christian, featured in the Al Trent Sextet."', 'Osborne was soon good enough on electric guitar that she joined pianist Winifred McDonnell\'s trio and toured extensively in North Dakota and Minnesota before heading east to Philadelphia and eventually New York City. It was there in 1941 that she gigged at Minton\'s Playhouse on 118th Street in Harlem, meeting and playing with the jazz greats Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster, and Art Tatum and jamming with the bop pioneer Dizzy Gillespie. Later, she recorded with all four, inspiring critic Leonard Feather to call her a pioneer of modern jazz guitar and describing her as having an "exceptional beat" and an "aggressively swinging style."', "Of all the great electric guitarists to come out of the jazz crucible of the American Midwest in the '30s, Floyd Smith is perhaps the least well known. Born in St. Louis in 1917, Smith received his first musical instruction on ukulele but then switched to banjo, joining the Jeter-Pillars Orchestra in his late teens and playing with that band for several years.", "By the mid-'30s, Smith was playing guitar, using an acoustic D'Angelico Excel for rhythm and soloing on a Vega electric. In 1939, when he joined Andy Kirk's famed Kansas City swing band, the Twelve Clouds Of Joy, he added another electric instrument to his arsenal—a Gibson EH-150 lap-steel guitar.", 'Though lap-steels had been used in Texas swing-style country music since the mid-\'30s, Smith was the first to adapt the instrument to the jazz idiom. Not everyone was a fan of the steel\'s fluid, slurry sound—John Hammond called it "ghastly"—but Floyd used it to good effect on more than a few Kirk selections, scoring a national hit for Kirk\'s Clouds Of Joy with \'Floyd\'s Guitar Blues,\' recorded shortly after he joined the band.', "Following his departure from the Clouds in the mid '40s, Smith worked with Coleman Hawkins, Horace Henderson, Illinois Jacquet, and many others, primarily on steel. In later years, though, he set aside his EH-150 and performed with the jazz organist Wild Bill Davis using a National Glenwood electric.", "Electricity inevitably elevated the humble guitar to a position of prominence in jazz. It was Eddie Durham who first pioneered its transition to an electric instrument, thus enabling big-band players to solo audibly, and it was Floyd Smith who demonstrated the lap-steel's jazz capabilities. Charlie Christian and his disciple Mary Osborne went on to show that it was possible to improvise on an electric guitar with a virtuosity rivaling that of the best jazz horn soloists.", "Today, jazz guitarists invariably plug in, using archtop and solidbody instruments played through a variety of amplifiers and effects to continue to expand the music's possibilities. Those possibilities, however, got their start in Kansas City nearly 90 years ago.", "About the author: David Dann is a music historian, writer, and amateur musician who is the author of Guitar King: Michael Bloomfield's Life In The Blues.

When talented artists lay down tracks in treated rooms, record into high-end consoles, sing through tube mics with perfect placement—that's a recipe for sonic perfection.", 'But not every great record needs such white-glove service. And in fact, you may be surprised to learn just how many incredible albums have been made with standard-issue mics.', 'In our list below, we are merely scratching the surface. And a few caveats are in order:', "Countless records use at least one inexpensive mic—on a snare drum, a guitar cab, or some other single instrument. But that's not where our focus lies today. Instead, we're talking about those records which primarily used cheap mics, or whose main vocal performances were captured by them.", 'There are times when an artist, producer, or engineer could be downplaying the equipment they actually had on hand, instead of fessing up to using really nice gear. That said, all of our records below have some documentation or on-the-record interviews that the players involved were using inexpensive microphones during the recording sessions.', "Even performances that were recorded with a cheap mic can of course be mixed and mastered with premium equipment. But this shouldn't stop you from using whatever you have on hand. If recording a project, you can always send out your tracks for mixing and mastering. And if you want to do it all yourself, modern plugins and 500 series rack gear all provide alternatives to professional studios.", "So, with those caveats behind us, here's a list that we hope gets a conversation started. What other great records were made with cheap mics?", 'The soaring choruses of "More Than a Feeling" dominated AM radio upon its 1976 release and have been a staple on "classic rock" radio since the beginning of the format. So it might not be the first thing you think of when you imagine DIY music.', "But the majority of that song—and Boston's self-titled debut album—was recorded in producer/multi-instrumentalist Tom Scholz's Watertown, Massachusetts basement, mostly with Shure SM57s.", "Outside of Brad Delp's lead vocals—which, according to a 2000 Mix article, were recorded in LA as part of a ruse to allow the Scholz to continue to work out of his basement—the whole song was a home-studio production.", 'Like Prince—who was known for cutting his own vocals while seated at the recording console—Solange Knowles has found that singing along to monitors allows her to get in the zone and capture a more emotive performance.', 'While Prince used everything from an SM57 to a AKG C12 or Neumann U 47, Solange has gravitated toward one mic in particular: the Shure Beta 58A.', 'In an interview with her go-to recording engineer Mikaelin "Blue" Bluespruce, he told Reverb:', '"The Shure Beta 58 is the main thing that has to be there in terms of recording. She really doesn\'t like to be standing in front of a mic. … She likes to be seated, walking around the room, or however she wants to be she wants to bring the mic with her and hold it in her hand. The Beta 58 is the only thing that has to be there."', "When you think of affordable gear, a $1,000 mic might not be your first thought, but when talking about Neumann, affordability is relative. The TLM 103, one of the company's least expensive mics, is a popular choice for young producers and engineers looking to level-up their setup with their first condenser.", 'Back in 2008, one such upcoming producer was Drake\'s right-hand man, Noah "40" Shebib. In apartments and hotel rooms, they created the tracks that would become So Far Gone, Drake\'s breakout mixtape, working off a Pro Tools-equipped laptop, some MBox interfaces, and a TLM 103. Singles like "Best I Ever Had" and "Successful" became enormous hits and launched the pop mainstay\'s career.', "In a 2014 blog post on their label's website, 40 looked back at the time:", '"I look at any old laptops or M-Box\'s like gold and that\'s where it starts. The hungry kids with what they can get their hands on making it not just work, but work at a professional level. … Now this may not be anything overwhelming in 2014. But in 2009 to be nominated for a Grammy and have multiple # 1\'s, it was still fairly astonishing that it wasn\'t an SSL 4K or a 1073 with a C800. It was a Neumann TLM 103, an amazing reasonably priced mic that gets the job done, a laptop and an M-Box. That\'s it."', 'Around that time, Vampire Weekend\'s Rostam Batmanglij was also getting the most out of a laptop recording rig. The group\'s debut album—which included hits like "A-Punk" and "Oxford Comma"—was recorded at several locations in and around New York City, including apartments and basements.', 'Rostam has since become one of the most successful pop and indie pop producers around, but back then he was still one of us, posting on gear forums about the equipment he used.', 'In a series of posts on Gearspace, he explained the various gear used on the record, which included little more than a Digidesign Digi 002 interface and plugins of the era like Altiverb, Vintage Warmer, and a "Vintage Spring Reverb" IR.', 'All of the mics were affordable. They used a TLM 103 for most of the vocals and, for tracks like "Oxford Comma," a single Sennheiser 421 for the drums: "most of the drum sound came from one mic … the room was carpeted and about 12\' X 12\', it was a practice room," he wrote.', "Like Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska, the lore around the recording of Bon Iver's debut is deeply connected to the record itself. The Boss' was a left-hand turn away from his stardom, a testament to deft songcraft and stark lyrical themes, recorded with two SM57s into a four-track cassette recorder. The more it sounded like a demo, the better.", 'For Emma, Forever Ago, on the other hand, became a breakout release for a rising producer-songwriter, who was trying to make a record that sounded as clean as he possibly could, with a single SM57 and an overloaded laptop.', 'In 2008, he explained his philosophy to Stereogum: "I just set up a few mics that I know sound good, like ribbons, and use common sense. If an $80 mic sounds better for what you are doing than the $1,100 mic does, it’s a no-brainer. Get pres that sound good to you, not to the forum junkies. That’s my philosophy. Try stuff out; that’s what I do."', 'His setup has definitely grown over the years to match his expanded musical palette—and you can see his gear-packed April Base studio in this 2014 video—but presumably the wall of Pultec, Teletronix, and other classic outboard gear does sound good to him.', "Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell, her brother, producer, and co-songwriter, are the reigning champions of home recording, creating an incredibly successful, multi-Grammy-Award-winning album in Finneas' bedroom.", "If you'll remember one of our caveats from above—that DIY tracks can be sent to pros for mixing and mastering—that did happen here, which has led to fairly wide speculation on gear forums if the record deserves its home-recorded status.", "But the fact of the matter is the tracks were created on what is now a standard modern computer rig, in the duo's childhood home. Finneas told Sound on Sound in 2019 that the setup included: Apple's Logic DAW, a MIDI controller to play a wide collection of software synths and samples, a Universal Audio Apollo interface, Yamaha monitors, and a Neumann TLM 103 for Eilish's vocals (which you can see in many scenes of the 2021 documentary about the making of the album, The World's a Little Blurry).", 'Going back a bit further to her breakout single, "Ocean Eyes," and the pair didn\'t even have the Neumann. For that song, Eilish sang into an Audio-Technica AT2020. In SOS Finneas says, "Billie\'s vocals for \'Ocean Eyes\' were recorded with the 2020, which sounds great. It\'s not quite as good as the Neumann, but I have never found a microphone that I like more than the 2020 that\'s less expensive than the Neumann.

But there was so much more to her career than that. Over an extraordinarily productive decade or so from the early '60s, she produced a huge volume of music at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. And that's not all.", "During those years, she and her Workshop colleague Brian Hodgson formed Unit Delta Plus with Peter Zinovieff, the founder of EMS, to create and promote electronic music. A little later there was the Kaleidophon studio, built in Camden, north London by Derbyshire, Hodgson, and David Vorhaus. And there were multiple one-off projects, collaborations, and commissions. The 267 reel-to-reel tapes found in her attic after her death contained music for stage, screens big and small, radio, '60s happenings, and art installations. Here we have space to explore just a tiny fragment of Derbyshire's work beyond Doctor Who.", 'Delia Derbyshire was born in Coventry, England in 1937. Academically and musically gifted, she won a scholarship to study maths at Cambridge, but after one year she switched to music. She graduated in 1959 and then spent a peripatetic year, mainly teaching and working in music publishing.', "In November 1960, she joined the BBC as a trainee assistant studio manager, and in April '62, she was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop, where our story begins. Brian Hodgson, who would become a close friend, joined the same year, followed by John Baker in 1963. These three were at the heart of a golden age of electronic music experimentation at the BBC.", 'From the late \'40s, two distinct schools of thought about electronic music emerged in Europe—musique concrète, from Paris, and elektronische musik, from Cologne. Musique concrète used manipulated recordings of "real" sound as its raw material, whereas elektronische musik chose electronically generated and filtered sine waves. The pioneer British electronic composers tended to avoid what often became a pedantic, doctrinaire distinction. This was the world that Derbyshire entered, and she demonstrated an unusual facility for combining both approaches.', 'In 1963, she created her arrangement of the Doctor Who theme, assisted by Dick Mills. At the time, it was just one in a steady stream of internal commissions that came her way for BBC television and radio. They required her to perform frequent leaps of creative imagination, from cerebral cultural experiments to lightweight novelty fragments and all points between.', "In 1964, she commenced work on four Inventions For Radio, created with the actor and dramatist Barry Bermange. These combined Derbyshire's electronic music with collages of interviews with members of the public discussing the dream state, the existence of God, the afterlife, and old age.", 'That same year there was Know Your Car, a musique concrète arrangement of Billy Murray\'s 1914 hit "He\'d Have To Get Under—Get Out And Get Under (To Fix Up His Automobile)." Speaking of this in The BBC Radiophonic Workshop: The First 25 Years (1983) by Desmond Briscoe and Roy Curtis-Bramwell, Derbyshire said: "I always immensely enjoyed doing funny programmes … I made it on simulated car horns and cut it together very carefully … [and] it was turned down because one particular car had been used for the series and the manufacturers didn\'t really want my efforts to be associated with their product."', "That rejection of a composition is an example of a tendency that eventually drove Derbyshire away from the BBC. In August 1965, while working on the final Invention, she was also composing for the children's educational programmes Primary School Mathematics Programme 2 (TV) and A Game of Chess (a dance drama for schools radio).", "The following year, the extra-curricular activity began in earnest. Derbyshire, Hodgson, and Zinovieff founded Unit Delta Plus. Neither a band nor an organization, but something in between, it operated out of Zinovieff's home studio in Putney, south London. The idea was both to create and promote electronic music.", "Zinovieff's studio was lavishly equipped. Independently wealthy, he had built a semi-subterranean base in his garden, which ran down to the River Thames. It housed his Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-8 computer that cost about £4,000—more than the average house price at the time.", "Unit Delta Plus embodied a culture clash, which explains why the project lasted little more than a year. Zinovieff was an innovative theorist, dismissive of tape techniques in electronic music and envisioning a world where computers told sound generators what to play. Derbyshire and Hodgson, meanwhile, came from a world of short-notice commissions, laborious tape splicing, and making it up as you went along. Zinovieff in particular would later dismiss the trio's musical output. Even so, they played a central role in two intriguing cultural moments.", 'On September 10, 1966, at the Watermill Theatre near Newbury in southern England, Unit Delta Plus hosted a concert of electronic music. It was the first ever in the UK, depending on how you define a concert. It featured seven pieces composed and realized by several combinations of the three members, along with light projections.', 'Derbyshire created or co-created four of these, including a 15-minute section of "Amor Dei," one of the Radio Inventions. Another was "Moogies Bloogies," which the programme notes called an "electronic pop song" for the singer and actor Anthony Newley. The notes went on to explain that the song contained traditional musical elements—melody, harmony, and rhythm—but that it was built up entirely of sine waves. The apparent reference to Moog in the title is probably coincidental. Newley pronounces the word as "mooj." Playful and odd, it was a one-off, a glimpse of an alternative future never explored. Derbyshire and Newley did not work together again.', "Another event, the 1967 Million Volt Light–Sound Rave at London's Roundhouse in north-west London featured a more famous one-off. The Rave took place over two nights (January 28 and February 4) and included tape music by Unit Delta Plus and the sole playback of Carnival of Light, Paul McCartney's 14-minute sound collage.", "The previous year, McCartney had visited Unit Delta Plus at the Putney studio. Decades later, he recalled this as a visit to the Radiophonic Workshop, saying he'd found Derbyshire's phone number and called her cold to arrange the visit. But a reference to going to a hut in the garden places him in Putney, which Derbyshire, Hodgson, and Zinovieff later confirmed.", 'Nothing much came of this meeting, apart from a tantalizing but unsubstantiated rumor that McCartney wanted Derbyshire to create an electronic version of "Yesterday." Symbolically, however, it\'s significant in two ways. McCartney, in meeting Unit Delta Plus, was following a trend in rock music—casting around for a new direction, including the exploration of electronic and tape music. And it was Derbyshire he settled on as the person to send him off on this journey, thus underlining her stature in British electronic music in the \'60s.', "The start of Derbyshire and Hodgson's next venture overlapped with the dying days of Unit Delta Plus. The American-born classical bass player David Vorhaus chanced upon a Unit Delta Plus lecture about electronic music. Within a week, he had teamed up with Hodgson and Derbyshire, and the three fashioned two tape compositions with added vocals, which caught the ear of Chris Blackwell at Island Records. He offered them a deal, and an album was pieced together through 1968 at their Kaleidophon studio.", 'The album was released the following year as An Electric Storm, credited to White Noise. With its squalls of electronic sound, mixed male and female harmony vocals, and a jazz drummer (Paul Lytton), all delivering a blend of progressive, folky, psychedelic rock, it sounded like nothing else in the UK.', 'It did, though, sound a little like the United States of America\'s sole album, released in 1968. The resemblance was superficial. Whereas the US band used a one-off electronic instrument as its sound source, White Noise deployed tape editing (and a rumor that the band used a prototype EMS VCS3 synth is incorrect). As Vorhaus explained in an interview for 2019\'s Delia Derbyshire Day, it was Derbyshire who led on the tape work: "… the splicing and things, Delia has this down to a fine art. She\'d chop stuff up really fast."', 'An Electric Storm was melodically rich and had a firm grasp of song craft, but it was just too strange to break through on first release. Over the years it has sold well, however, the fullest ever expression of tape-editing technique on a rock record.', "Derbyshire continued working at the Radiophonic Workshop into the '70s. She left in 1973, frustrated by deadline pressures and the rejection of some of her output. Briefly, she teamed up with Hodgson, who left the Workshop that same year to set up the Electrophon studio. She collaborated with him on the score to the horror movie The Legend of Hell House, but left soon after. From then on, little was heard of her musically, though she occasionally composed for art films.", "By the '90s, a generation of British musicians, writers, and Doctor Who fans—whose childhoods had been soundtracked by Derbyshire's music—began to seek her out. She was interviewed for radio and several fanzines. Pete Kember, a.k.a. Sonic Boom of Spacemen 3, coaxed her into a tentative re-engagement with music. Their Synchrondipity Machine (An Unfinished Dream) was recorded in 2000, using then current computer technology. It sounded oddly similar to the sort of tape and oscillator soundscapes Derbyshire had turned out every week for the BBC, 35 years earlier.", 'Delia Derbyshire died in 2001. Her archive now resides at the University of Manchester in England. The work of researching, cataloguing, and reissuing her extraordinary musical output continues.', 'About the author: Mark Brend is an author and a musician.

Alongside are plenty of photos and catalogue shots and a pile of letters and bills and ephemera from the collection of a man who clearly has no access to a wastepaper bin.", 'We asked Dan to focus on one part of his story, to tell us how outboard microphone preamplifiers came into vogue. How did these hidden components that nobody thought much about turn into standalone items that everybody suddenly seemed to want?', "He takes us back to 1979, when he met Peter Duncan, an English audio dealer, at one of the Audio Engineering Society's regular gatherings of recording-biz folk.", '"Peter took me out to his car and showed me these Neve modules he\'d brought to sell to a guy who hadn\'t shown up," Dan recalls. "He said I could give him 50 bucks apiece so he didn\'t have to take them back."', "Dan bought them, and then wondered why. He'd never sold an outboard microphone preamp before.", '"I\'d go around all these studios, tell them I\'d got these old Neve modules and that they could mount them in a box, plug their mics into them, and get the Neve sound. They would look at me with a quizzical expression, scratch their heads, and pass on the idea."', "In the early '80s, he walked into Allen Sides' Ocean Way Studio A, which by then had relocated to the original United Western building and had become one of the best studios in Los Angeles. Dan, a regular visitor, saw Allen fiddling at a console.", '"It was a 40-input API that had come from the Record Plant, and sitting on top of the console he had a little rack. I looked closer, and in that little rack was an API 312 mic pre card," he says. "It was hooked up to a Urei 1176 compressor and thence to a patch bay.', '"I said to Allen, \'You have an API console," Dan continues, "so why are you doing this?\' And he said something meaningful that has always stuck in my mind: \'It\'s the shortest signal path to the recorder.\' What that amounts to—in general, in audio—is that shorter signal paths just sound better. That\'s why if you compare the sound of an old Neve to the sound of other more modern consoles—anything that has lots and lots of signal path—then, usually, the simple circuits actually sound the best."', 'It took until 1984 for Dan to finally sell the first pair of those Neve mic pres, and the customer was the engineer John Cuniberti, who used them to record Joe Satriani\'s 1987 album Surfing With the Alien. The record became something of a benchmark for hi-fi rock sound, not to mention Joe\'s extraordinary playing. "So then I was able to tell everyone hey, that was recorded through a pair of Neve modules," Dan says. "And that\'s when I started selling Neve modules as a regular thing. It went insane. For a number of years, the only thing that would sell was Neve modules—although currently, any number of older modules are sought after."', 'Why? Dan looks around today and, of course, he sees how normal and unremarkable it is for engineers to carry around boxes of mic pres. Most studios now, big or small, with or without a console, have a rack of outboard mic pres. They have become part of standard operating procedure.', '"You plug your mic into your mic preamp, and then you put it into your computer," he observes. "But in your major recording studios, you\'ve got, say, a Neve console—but you\'ve still got a big rack of 500 Series mic preamps and whatever else. Currently, someone who has a studio in their bedroom can go buy any number of high-end mic preamps and actually obtain a quality of signal that rivals many professional studios."', 'What was it, then, that caused the change of attitude to mic pres back in the day? Dan does not hesitate in his answer:', '"The recording consoles that were being installed in studios back then didn\'t sound all that great, and that had an awful lot to do with mic pres catching on. Most console manufacturers had gone to electronics that were IC-based. Those consoles had extensive facilities but utilized a long line of amplifiers, and they sounded kind of electronic. But it\'s pretty hard to plug a mic into an old Neve pre, put the mic in front of a signal source, no matter what that may be, and not have it sound like, Wow! That sounds great!"', 'Not that it\'s quite as simple as that. "Of course, it\'s not like every old outboard pre sounds great—that\'s just not true. What has happened is a lot of vintage audio dealers needed something to sell, so \'vintage\' became good, and the sales pitch was: \'If it\'s old, it\'s great.\' But that\'s not always true. There\'s great old design, and there\'s not so great old design, and there\'s also great modern design."', 'Back in Dan\'s pioneering days, instead of old consoles going to the skip, they\'d be stripped and remade into outboard mic pres. They were given "a whole new existence," as Dan puts it. He lists some of the brands that gave that idea credence—older pres from CADAC, Calrec, API, Neve, Pultec, Langevin, and so on.', '"They can sound so fantastic," he says. "Western Electric, RCA stuff, there\'s a long list of really great sounding gear. But there\'s also equipment that\'s more mundane and not necessarily all that wonderful."', 'Why do the best ones sound so good? "In general, I\'d say first it\'s because the people who designed them were very aware of fidelity and sound. And second, they\'re overwhelmingly simple in their electronic circuits. APIs and Neves, for example, have such a small amount of circuitry involved. There\'s just not much of it—and it sounds wonderful."', "That simple circuitry wasn't consistent from one brand to the next, necessarily, but most of the pres from the venerable brands Dan mentions have just an input transformer, then an amplifier or maybe a couple of amplifiers, and then an output transformer.", '"With many of these devices, there\'s also an equalizer that\'s part of the module," Dan adds. "And those equalizers, depending on which one you\'re talking about, sound freakin\' awesome—they\'re musical, and beautiful, and sound natural. But look, you can take anything and if you adjust it incorrectly or whatever, of course you can ruin things. In general, though, those high-end mic preamps—which are actually console modules that incorporate an equalizer—are simply great."', 'There is a shortcoming, Dan suggests. "None of these devices can rewrite the lyrics," he says, laughing out loud at the thought. "I think the digital empowerment that comes with a lot of the technological shifts we\'ve seen has been a two-edged sword. When you compare the songwriting from 1965 to 1975 to the songwriting from, say, 2010 to 2020, I just, ah…" He stops, uncharacteristically lost for words. "I mean, who writes songs as good as Ray Davies? I don\'t know."', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

'https://reverb.com/news/the-defining-guitarists-and-gear-of-90s-hardcore-punk', 'https://reverb.com/c/electric-guitars/'], ['Pop punk doesn’t always get the recognition it deserves, and it’s often overlooked when talking about gear. We’re at a point in time now where many guitarists in their 20s and 30s were inspired to start playing just as much, if not more, by the bands like blink-182 and Green Day as they were by the likes of Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin.', 'Pop punk was huge in the 2000s and went hand in hand with the skate culture at that time. As its name suggests, it’s a lighter, more pop-influenced approach to punk and punk rock. Like with any genre of music, there are so many variations of pop punk. Some are closer to its punk rock roots—raw, gritty, screamy, and not necessarily radio-friendly—and some are super polished and sit perfectly on mainstream radio.', "This genre was what it was because of the band as a whole—the interplay between each member contributed to their sound and style, and many of the scene's lyrics and aesthetic were rooted in collective commiseration. Whether they knew it at the time or not, this group of musicians contributed to the development of a culture that defined a generation's personality and inspired those kids to pick up an instrument. This article is going to look at some of these musicians' go-to tools of the trade.", "For the purposes of this piece, we’re looking primarily at key guitarists and their gear. This article could've been exponentially longer if we went comprehensive, but for the sake of clarity, we wanted to try and cover as many bases as possible—even those in the periphery of the scene but whose contributions shouldn’t be overlooked.", 'You’ll find that many of these artists were using the same or similar gear as one another. Obviously, the sound that came from these guitars and amps was a factor, but availability and cost would also be a consideration. It’s also worth noting that the attitude and playing style of each guitarist is of paramount importance —Laura Jane Grace of Against Me! Is a great example of this. She plays what is essentially a Beatles rig (Rickenbacker guitars through Vox amps) but with a punk rock attitude, and it works perfectly. So, here are some of the key guitarists and gear of 2000s pop punk.', 'No discussion of pop punk can take place without mention of blink-182. blink was arguably the biggest band on the pop punk scene, and they’re still huge today (fronted by Mark Hoppus and with Travis Barker still on drums). The trio made the ubiquitous I, V, VI, IV power chord sequence their own, and showcased some incredible interplay between DeLonge and bass player Mark Hoppus.', "Tom’s late-'90s/early 2000s tone was fairly simple—usually distorted, with clean breaks and not many effects. His playing, whilst not complicated, was incredibly effective. He let chords ring out at the start of verses, employed palm-muting, helped bring the dynamics down so that bridges and choruses stood out more, played jangly single-note riffs, used octave melodies to counter the vocals, etc.", "Some may dismiss blink as a one-trick-pony but their sound developed with each album they put out. Early albums like Buddha and Cheshire Cat featured a more raw sound, closer to old-school punk rock. They seemed to hit their stride in terms of songwriting on Enema Of The State in the late '90s, which produced two massive hits for the band: All The Small Things and What’s My Age Again?", 'Then came 2001’s Take Off Your Pants And Jacket—a masterclass in pop punk writing. Their sound matured and the guitar playing, whilst still not necessarily complex, wasn’t simple either. Down-stroking quickly whilst-palm muting is harder than it looks, and just listen to how well the riff sits with the bassline on songs like "First Date" and "Online Songs."', 'Not only did their songs develop, but Tom’s sound changed over the years too. The classic blink sound is a humbucker-equipped Strat, through a Mesa Boogie Triple Rectifier. A little later, he added a Marshall JCM900 into the mix.', 'Fender made a signature Tom DeLonge Strat, fitted with a single Seymour Duncan Invader pickup that he used a lot. Box Car Racer saw him move to a Gibson ES-335, and after that, for the self-titled blink-182 album, he had his signature Gibson ES-333 (Epiphone also make a great version of the Tom DeLonge 333).', 'Throughout blink, Tom tended to favor humbuckers, which makes sense as he was the only guitarist in the band and humbuckers will fill a little more sonic space (you’ll notice that there are a lot of open strings ringing out in his riffs, too, for the same reason). This paired perfectly with the rumble of Mark’s Fender P-Bass (and signature Artist Series Jazz Bass) and Ampeg SVT.', 'After extensively touring their EP, Half Hour Of Power, Sum 41 really burst onto the scene in 2001, with their debut album All Killer No Filler . This was a huge album for pop punk and boasted a string of hits for the band.', 'Whilst the songwriting, musical style, and general aesthetic of Sum 41 fit nicely into the pop punk category, lead guitarist Dave Baksh leaned into a slightly more heavy metal-tinged sound, giving them a unique edge.', 'All Killer No Filler is undeniably a pop punk record, but there are moments that showcase some much heavier influences. The solo on "In Too Deep" features both finger tapping and harmonized guitars—there are numerous examples of harmonized riffs and the song "Pain For Pleasure" is a shameless glam metal throwback. The band explored heavier sounds with their 2003 album Does This Look Infected?, but it still had that pop-punk sheen.', 'Rhythm guitarist and frontman Deryck Whibley tended to stick to power chords and riffs, while Baksh handled any solos and lead work. Both players used a range of humbucker-equipped guitars. Whibley has been known to use Fender Telecaster Deluxes, Gibson Les Pauls (specifically a Gold LP Classic) and a Gibson Marauder, modded with a humbucker in the bridge. Squier even produced a Deryck Whibley Telecaster, featuring a single humbucker in the bridge position.', 'Dave Baksh’s playing style was different to most other pop punk players at the time, and his gear reflected that. At that time, PRS guitars were commonly associated with nu-metal, but Baksh was usually seen with PRS Singlecut—he’s actually got a Tremonti signature prototype from 2003. PRS pickups are voiced differently to Gibson and Fender humbuckers, so the combination of the two in one band complemented each other nicely.', "They've used loads of different amps throughout the years, but Marshall tends to feature a lot. The JCM800, JCM2000 DSLs, JMPs have all been used by either Baksh or Whibley. As the sound got heavier, Dave started using a Soldano SLO100 head—an amp usually favored by metal players.", 'More recently, they’ve all gone to Kempers, using profiles of various amps in their collection: Plexis, an AC30, a Fender Deluxe combo, and lots more.', 'Avril Lavigne had a string of hits in the early 2000s and was a key figure of the pop punk movement. The sound of Avril’s debut album, Let Go, harbored some of the same teenage angst showcased by fellow Canadian Alanis Morissette (particularly opening track "Losing Grip"), but blended it with catchy and poppier vocal hooks. Solid songwriting, combined with the use of both acoustic and electric guitars and contemporary production, helped place it on mainstream radio stations around the world.', 'Avril’s songs were pop and rock in equal parts (some of that debut album could even be considered post-grunge), but her and her bands’ aesthetic was firmly rooted in punk. Plus, she had a song called "Sk8er Boi," so they certainly fit nicely into the pop punk skate culture genre.', 'It’s also important to note that the early 2000s were prime years for MTV, and Avril Lavigne was one of the few females getting airtime who fronted a rock band, wielding a guitar. This was particularly inspiring to young girls at the time, and as such, Avril’s importance as a guitar player and songwriter in pop punk of the 2000s can’t be overstated.', 'The guitar playing on many of Avril’s songs is perhaps a little different to others on this list. Songs like "Girlfriend" showcase some classic pop punk guitar tricks: octaves played on the A and G strings, I - V - VI - IV chord sequence, and static riffs played over moving chords. Others, such as "I’m With You," featured more open chords and the use of a capo—plus, some more colorful chords, like sus2, minor7, add9, etc.', 'Avril and the other guitarists in the band were usually seen playing guitars with humbuckers, meaning that their collective sound was huge. Quite often, she’d be playing a Telecaster with a single humbucker (Squier actually produced a signature Avril Lavigne Telecaster) or a Gibson Les Paul Studio.', 'She was also seen playing a range of acoustic guitars, including a Gibson L-00, Takamine dreadnought and more recently, her signature Fender Newporter. Like a lot of pop punk of the 2000s, you can hear Mesa Boogie Triple Rectifiers in a lot of Avril’s stuff.', 'The Donnas merged classic rock ’n’ roll and old school punk with, as production budgets increased, a poppier, more polished sound. They released seven albums in ten years, each with a different sound. The Donnas’ earlier albums showcased a raw, punk rock energy, and, as they progressed, it seems that more of their classic rock and metal influences crept into their sound.', "Their fifth album, Spend The Night, was released in 2002 and was their first on a major label. As such, it's incredibly well-produced and has much of the sheen that high-budget pop punk had at that time. Musically, they’re very different to the other bands on this list, but the energy and attitude in The Donnas’ songs fits the pop punk aesthetic nicely. It’s one of the reasons why they’d fit just as well on a bill with someone like blink-182 as they would with Mötley Crüe.", "A lot of their songs, particularly off Get Skintight and The Donnas Turn 21, have many of the defining features of pop punk, but it’s Allison Robertson’s guitar playing (and writing arrangements from the other members) that helps them stand out from other pop punk bands. What could easily be simple, high-energy, three-chord punk songs are broken up with Zeppelin-esque guitar breaks and classic rock 'n' roll-style solos, warranting her inclusion on this list.", 'Robertson got her sound from the trusty combination of a Gibson Les Paul Standard plugged into a Marshall stack—usually a JCM2000 DSL100 (a fairly widely used amp of that particular era). She’d sometimes use an SG loaded with P90s too, for when something a little bit more cutting was required.', 'Whole Wheat Bread was an often overlooked band of the 2000s. When people talk about the blend of rock and hip-hop, they’ll often cite bands like Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park. But Whole Wheat Bread managed to intertwine hip-hop elements into an undeniably pop punk sound, too, resulting in something completely unique that saw them supporting a diverse array of acts from the likes of Reel Big Fish to Killah Priest.', 'The 2005 album Minority Rules is made up of catchy three- and four-chord style anthems that are packed full of energy and attitude. The sound leans more towards punk rock than anything else, but guitarist and vocalist Aaron Abraham’s playing style fits perfectly into the pop punk bracket. The album even has three hidden tracks at the end that are straight-up hip-hop.', 'Their follow-up album, Hearts Of Hoodlums, features a more polished sound, akin to some of their pop punk peers. However, it also incorporated more of their hip-hop influences than their debut.', 'Being the only guitarist in a band like this almost necessitates the use of humbuckers. Abraham is almost exclusively seen (online at least) playing a Gibson Les Paul Standard, plugged into either a Marshall (JCM800 or DSLs) or a Mesa Boogie Dual Rectifier. The sound isn’t too saturated, but there’s a nice crunch that works well with the classic pop punk bass sound achieved by plugging a Fender Jazz bass into an Ampeg SVT.', 'Like with many examples of good pop punk, Whole Wheat Bread showcased some incredible interplay between the guitar and bass, with lines that are cleverly written and more often than not, harder to play than they may first seem.', "Not only are Green Day one of the most successful pop punk bands, they’re also one of the best-selling musical artists of all time, having sold millions and millions of records worldwide over their four-decade-plus career. The trio enjoyed some success in the '90s with albums such as Dookie, Nimrod, and Insomniac. Whilst their music was rooted in punk rock, they had a tendency to write incredibly catchy songs with pop-style vocal arrangements and harmonies.", 'Each album saw the band get bigger and bigger, until they crossed over into the mainstream with their 2004 release, American Idiot. This was one of the biggest and most successful rock albums of all time—it was even adapted into a Broadway musical.', 'The album saw an evolution of the band’s songwriting, as well as the introduction of a second guitar player. It served as a defining point in the band’s career—their catalogue has since been split by fans into albums before and after American Idiot. Whilst their earlier material was closer to punk rock than it was radio-friendly rock, they were unknowingly laying the foundations for the pop punk to come.', 'Green Day’s music from American Idiot onwards became more polished, and they swapped their Ramones-style I - IV - V chord sequences in favor of more colorful variations, employing the use of more minor and major chords and drawing inspiration from some unlikely sources such as Britpop legends, Oasis.', 'Billie Joe’s pre-American Idiot rig consisted of a Fernandes Strat modded with a Seymour Duncan SH-4 JB humbucker fitted at an angle—that’s what you’ll hear on tracks such as "Basket Case" and "Welcome To Paradise." The middle and neck pickups were disconnected on this, making it very similar to Tom DeLonge’s Strat.', 'In the early days of Green Day, he was using the Strat with a Gallien-Krueger 250RL, but then moved on to Marshall Super Lead Plexis. In fact, the MXR Dookie pedal is actually based on the Plexi used on the recording of that album. Billie Joe has stuck to the sound of a cranked Plexi ever since.', 'A range of guitars were used for the recording of American Idiot, but since then, he’s taken to using Gibson Les Paul Juniors most of the time. This may be to yield a different sort of sound, but it may also be because Jason White joined the band at this time as a second guitarist, and he didn’t need one guitar to fill as much space anymore.', "Gibson has made a few different signature guitars for him as well—the Billie Joe Armstrong Les Paul Junior Doublecut (similar to the '59 model he uses), the 2018 humbucker-equipped Singlecut Junior, and a Singlecut Junior with P-90.", 'Meg & Dia were a slightly lesser-known band of the mid-2000s, named after the two founding sisters. Their first album as a full band, Something Real (produced by American HiFi frontman Stacy Jones), is a blend of pop punk, coffee shop rock, and emo, and featured some incredibly catchy and well-written songs.', 'Emo grew into the mainstream alongside pop punk in the late-1990s and 2000s and, whilst both sub-genres shared a lot of the same fan-base, emo tended to be heavier and more musically complex. Early emo is more often likened to post-hardcore and featured more math-rock components than pop punk was known for. Meg & Dia sort of bridged the gap between the likes of blink-182 and Paramore and were seen touring with bands including Angels & Airwaves and Four Year Strong, as well as appearing on the Warped Tour a number of times.', "Meg & Dia had a radio-friendly sound, but showcased a lot of the pop punk hallmarks, as well as the more complicated sound of emo. There was less of the punk rock attitude in the music compared to some other bands on this list, but it can be argued that Meg & Dia's music exemplify some similarities between pop punk and heavier emo and that the band helped evolve the genre into what it became in the late 2000s and early 2010s.", 'Many of Meg & Dia’s songs contain palm-muting, octave riffs, and classic pop punk chord sequences—but they were by no means one-dimensional. Meg liked to use open and extended chords as well as power chords, giving the sound lots of color.', 'The use of major7 and 9 chords, for example, lend a strong sense of melody and go incredibly well with Dia’s vocals. The acoustic-led "Cardigan Weather" is a great example of this, featuring more open and extended chords, as well as more considered strumming patterns and lead lines. There’s also quite a lot of acoustic guitar alongside the electrics, helping them stand out from the bigger pop punk bands at the time.', 'There’s not a ton of information about Meg’s rig, but from information online, she seemed to favor humbuckers like many other pop punkers. Most pictures show her playing a Gibson Les Paul Custom, though she is also seen using a Gibson ES-335 and a Fender Telecaster. For acoustics, it looks like she played Taylor Grand Auditorium guitars—a brand that was rapidly becoming more and more popular at the time, and were known for reliability and great electro-acoustic sound.', 'Amp-wise, like many other players within the genre, Meg used either Marshalls or Mesa Boogie. There’s video footage of them playing at the Warped Tour with a number of JCM2000 DSLs on stage, which could very well be a backline rig, but really highlights how great these amps were for that style of music.', 'Pop-punk was huge in the 2000s, and it’s still widely popular today. This article could have been much, much longer. There were guitarists from so many bands that helped inspire kids to get into music, but we’ve tried to pick some that were key figures in the movement, or were doing things a little differently and helped evolve the genre.

Known primarily as a jazz keyboardist, Hancock also dabbled in pop, R&B, funk, disco, hip-hop, and soundtracks. His use of synthesizers and other electronic gear was always forward-thinking, readily adapting new technology and folding it into his way of working. Through songs like "Chameleon," "Rockit" and "I Thought It Was You," to say that he helped popularize synthesizers in the late 20th century is an understatement.', 'What’s particularly shocking is that Hancock started as something of a piano purist. Formerly a classical music child prodigy, Hancock joined Miles Davis’ Second Great Quintet in 1963. He credits Miles as helping open his mind to the kinds of musical possibilities beyond the piano specifically and jazz more broadly as well.', '"We were doing a recording session with Miles, and when I came into the studio I didn\'t see any acoustic piano anywhere," Hancock said in an interview with Sound On Sound magazine in 2002. "In the corner of the room was only this Wurlitzer electric piano that I\'d never played before. I asked Miles what he wanted me to play, and he said \'Play that.\' I was thinking \'That toy?\' Then I turned it on and was really surprised by the sound. It sounded beautiful! From that I learned not to form an opinion on something you have no experience of."', 'This open-mindedness would go on to serve Hancock time and time again, both in working with electronic gear (synthesizers, drum machines, samplers) and in embracing new styles of music (funk, disco, hip-hop).', 'Hancock has never been secretive or precious about his gear, either, helpfully listing his instruments on most of his record jackets. We’ll use this as a road map to trace his career from the early 1970s to the early 1980s, and highlight how his use of gear informed not only his own sound but popular music in general.', 'In the early 1970s there just weren’t that many synthesizers on the market. Consequently, most musicians were either on team Moog or team ARP. This was true of rock (Keith Emerson’s famous Moog Modular versus Edgar Winter’s ARP 2600), funk (James Brown and a Moog Minimoog and Kool And The Gang and The Commodores with ARP 2600s), and of course jazz (Chick Corea’s Minimoog and Joe Zawinul’s dual 2600s). This is a simplification but in general, artists tended to work with either one or the other. Hancock was on team ARP.', 'Head Hunters, released in 1973 and recorded with the band Headhunters, sees Herbie making deft use of an ARP Odyssey and Soloist for the synthesizer parts.', 'The ARP Odyssey was a monophonic synthesizer released in 1972. Intended as a competitor to the Minimoog, it has a rougher sound than Moog’s monosynth. And while the Minimoog is famous as a bass machine (and rightfully so), the ARP Odyssey is no slouch in the low-end department either, as the bass line in album opener "Chameleon" demonstrates. Yes, one of the most famous synth bass lines ever was done on an Odyssey. The Odyssey is also famous for leads, and you can hear Herbie putting his through its paces in the synth solo on "Chameleon."', 'The Soloist is less well-known than the Odyssey. First released in 1970 (and later replaced by the Pro Soloist), it was a preset-only monosynth designed to sit on top of an organ. It had 18 presets with the typical complement of faux-acoustic instrument sounds. It is, however, extremely funky (just ask the Ohio Players and their "Funky Worm").', 'While Hancock’s experimentations with synthesizers certainly began around the time of Head Hunters, the crossover popularity of "Chameleon" helped usher synths into a wider general acceptance.', 'Where Head Hunters is funky and earthbound, Sextant, released the same year and recorded with his Mwandishi group, sounds like nothing short of a trip through the Stargate at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Influenced by his time spent with Miles Davis—and sharing some of the same DNA as Miles’ landmark Bitches Brew—it’s profoundly psychedelic, with all manner of wild effects like the Fender Fuzz Wah, Countryman Phase Shifter, and Echoplex transforming traditional instruments into phantoms and monsters.', 'Another chief component to the album’s sound is ARP synthesizers, this time in the form of a 2600 and Pro Soloist. Both were played by Patrick Gleeson (with "assistance from Herbie," as the liner notes assert).', 'The 2600 was ARP’s 1971 follow-up to their gargantuan 2500 and the first semi-modular synthesizer. It was capable of bass and leads but also all manner of wild effects, as heard on "Raindance." It’s hard to believe that this record was filed under "jazz" in 1973.', 'The Pro Soloist replaced the Soloist in 1972 and upped the preset count to 30. It was also reportedly less prone to breaking down. And, although not credited, Sextant (and especially "Rain Dance") wouldn’t be what it is without the 16-step ARP Sequencer. Sequencers were pretty exotic even in rock and electronic music at the time. In jazz, it was unheard of. Check out "Nobu" on Hancock’s Dedication album for more mind-melting ARP Sequencer jazz.', 'We would be remiss to not mention Patrick Gleeson at this point. Gleeson—who first appeared on a Hancock record with Crossings, adding Moog Modular to the electric mix—was originally hired as a synthesizer tech but was later asked to stay on as a member of the band. He became something of a synth mentor for the band leader, teaching him technique, according to Hancock. This was part of the jazz great’s talent—he knew how to bring in the right people to expand his vision and creativity.', 'Hancock’s core gear list would remain relatively unchanged through the rest of the mid-‘70s. he did pick up a few choice instruments along the way, such as the Oberheim 8-Voice for Man-Child and a Moog Micromoog on Secrets, but the biggest change to his 1970s sound was yet to come.', 'By the late 1970s, the sound of jazz was changing. It was becoming smoother, with the far-out explorations of just a few years before replaced by more radio-friendly, R&B-style grooves. Hancock’s Sunlight album was in line with this larger trend and spawned the hit vocal track, "I Thought It Was You." But what made this track unique was more than just the presence of vocals—they were vocoder vocals.', 'Hancock’s late-‘70s/early ‘80s records were dominated by the sound of the vocoder—specifically, a Sennheiser VSM-201, the same model Kraftwerk used. Vocoders had been around for a few years but the late-1970s saw their use explode in popular music, with E.L.O., Giorgio Moroder, and the previously mentioned German quartet keeping the sound alive.', 'With its pinched, almost nasal sound, Hancock’s vocoder was particularly influential on later bands like Zapp, who would use a talk box to create a similar, funky effect.', 'While the usual monosynths were present and accounted for on Sunlight (Moog Minimoog and Micromoog, ARP Odyssey and 2600) the big addition to Hancock’s sound here was the polysynth. By the time of Sunlight, synthesizer technology had reached the point where it was possible to play more than one note at the same time. For a former classical pianist like Hancock, this must have been a godsend.', 'A glance at the epic photo on the back cover of the album reveals an Oberheim 8-Voice, ARP String Ensemble, Moog PolyMoog, and Sequential Circuits Prophet-5. And, while there is a Yamaha CS-50 there behind him, the lack of a flagship CS-80 is rather surprising, although Hancock would add one by the time of Lite Me Up in 1982.', 'Like many other artists in the 1970s, Hancock was feeling the pull of the dance floor, and Feets Don’t Fail Me Now features plenty of DJ-ready vocoder disco jazz. While Hancock’s gear list for Feets was largely the same as Sunlight, one thing that was different was the presence of programmer Gordon Bahary, later of electro group Twilight 22 fame. We spoke with Bahary about his time working with Hancock.', 'Hancock got in touch with Bahary after his work on Stevie Wonder’s album, The Secret Life Of Plants, and worked with Hancock at Automat Studios in San Francisco. "I created synthesizer sounds so he could play most of the instruments," Bahary explained. "My focus on this album was more orchestral instruments."', '"Herbie was one of the most adept musicians in terms of innovation," he continued, "so it was fantastic to bounce ideas off each other. He understood everything I was doing with filters, resonance, envelopes. Most of the other people there did not understand what we were doing at the time. Today it is more understood and common. So we were in our own world speaking our own language. It was great fun."', 'When asked what instruments he remembered at the sessions, Bahary confirmed the Oberheim 8-Voice and Sennheiser vocoder. He also brought one of his own: a custom-made, touch sensitive Odyssey built for him by ARP in 1975 upon his request. This can also be heard on "Electric Kingdom," Twilight 22’s 1983 hip-hop hit.', 'How was it working with Hancock? "He was a gentleman and very kind to everyone, as well as humble," remembered Bahary. "I’m still gaining more appreciation today for all that I learned. He was a consummate professional in all areas of the session, including the arrangements he wrote for individual musicians and orchestra, and was respectful to each musician."', 'Another example of Hancock knowing what he wanted and working with the right people to achieve his vision.', 'In 1983, Hancock hooked up with another co-conspirator, Bill Laswell of Material, to create the genre-busting "Rockit." Melding jazz with then-underground hip-hop, it was a high-watermark for ‘80s popular music and reinvigorated Hancock’s career in the process. The track was followed by the album Future Shock, which further expanded the definition of jazz with electronics, drum machines, and hip-hop and African rhythms.', 'In keeping with its modern style, the album used a number of then-cutting edge (and very expensive) instruments, like the Fairlight CMI sampler and Moog Memorymoog. While there aren’t any ARP instruments listed on the album credits, the unstoppable lead line on "Rockit" was played on a Rhodes Chroma. Developed by ARP, the polyphonic Chroma was the company’s final instrument before declaring bankruptcy and being bought by CBS/Rhodes.', 'Other unique pieces of gear used on the sessions included the Yamaha GS-1 (a pre-DX7 FM synth), a Garfield Electronics Doctor Click Rhythm Controller for ensuring all the gear could sync together, and an E-mu Systems 4060 Digital Keyboard. Released in 1976, this polyphonic keyboard controller could act as a trigger for modular systems, could sample, and had an onboard sampler.', 'Future Shock also featured a Syntauri alphaSyntauri, a digital synth housed inside an Apple IIe. Yes, it was an early soft synth—an additive one, to be exact, based around the Mountain Computer Music System sound card. There was also an external keyboard that connected to the computer via SCSI—very cutting edge for 1983.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

foundational bass, join us on a journey through the history and evolution of the modern kit, one shell at a time.', 'Devoid of any modern contraptions like foot-operated beaters or strainer mechanisms, the tom-tom is a drum as simple as they come: a cylindrical shell with two tensioned drumheads. Its deep, melodic tones have been integral to the development of modern popular music and can be heard anchoring famous tunes across all genres, from Benny Goodman\'s "Sing, Sing, Sing!" and The Sufaris\' "Wipeout" to "Come Together" by The Beatles and "Run to the Hills" by Iron Maiden.', 'Despite its humble beginnings, the development of the tom has been inextricably linked with the evolution of recording technology and pop trends through the 20th century. It is perhaps the one piece of the drum kit most indicative of its era.', 'As the drum kit coalesced into a complete unit during the early 20th century, drummers looked for trebly, staccato sounds that would translate well onto the primitive recording media of the time. Bass drums were too bass-heavy, and snare drums were just overpowering.', 'Woodblocks, bells, and small cymbals (referred to collectively as "traps," short for "contraptions") would be mounted on a small rail or table atop the bass drum. Many of these new sounds had their origins in Europe and Asia, including curiously ornate small drums called tom-toms.', 'Usually 8" to 14" in diameter and rarely more than a few inches deep, these exotic drums had bowed wooden shells with two tacked-on drumheads often adorned with traditional Chinese painted scenes. American drum companies like Ludwig and Slingerland would soon begin importing the instruments from China and incorporating them into their outfits.', 'As the volume and size of the big bands grew and recording technology improved throughout the 1920s, drummers began to favor larger drums. Traps were playing a less pivotal role in the music, and manufacturers were now supplementing their basic kits with one-, two-, and three-tom setups mounted on elaborate metal rail systems called "consoles."', 'But instead of Chinese-style drums, these were deeper (7x12", 9x13", or 12x14") and featured the same shell layup and finish options as their bass and snare drum counterparts. Most importantly, the top heads now featured T-rods or key screws to enable the batter head to be tuned, while the bottom head retained its primitive tacked-on design.', 'In the 1930s, an up-and-coming Chicago-born drummer named Gene Krupa signed with the Slingerland Drum Company as an endorser and began working with the firm to introduce some innovations into their products. Krupa insisted that his toms be fully tunable, with both the batter and resonant heads featuring metal hoops, lugs, and tension rods.', 'The smaller drums were mounted on the bass drum via a small "consolette," while the larger models came with their own floor-standing baskets, as was typical for the time. Within a few years, the baskets had been replaced with individual height-adjustable legs, and the modern floor tom was born.', 'Dubbed the Radio King series, these "Krupa-style" kits would become the model by which all drum makers would design their products, though Chinese toms, tacked heads, and baskets could still be found on certain outfits from Ludwig, Gretsch, and Slingerland all the way up until the late \'40s.', 'Post-World War II saw the size of the standard drum kit shrink once again, as radio and recording tech continued to advance. By now, configurations had become somewhat standardized into basic 3- and 4-piece kits. For the first time, noticeable distinctions along genre lines began to appear.', 'While big band and straight ahead rock \'n\' roll drummers still favored the now-standard 9x13" and 16x16" setup, bop and small-group jazz players migrated towards 8x12" and 14x14" models, often tuning them up higher to produce a more melodic tone.', 'But by the 1960s, players had begun experimenting with expanded setups once again. As guitar rigs continued to get louder, drummers added larger drums (and more of them) to compensate. Nick Mason, Ginger Baker, and Keith Moon led the charge, all playing double-bass kits with upwards of four or five toms.', 'The music reflected this, too. Gone were the simple backbeat rhythms of the previous decade, as Jazz, African, and Latin influences began to creep into the mainstream. Manufacturers responded in kind, offering triple and quad-tom double bass kits (such as the Ludwig Rock Duo and Gretsch Avant Garde) and outfits incorporating timbales, cowbells, and other "world" instruments (like the Rogers Timbale Twin and Ludwig Carioca)—almost a modern throwback to the "traps" of old.', "Once again, developments in recording technology would spur changes in the drum kit as the '60s came to a close. Up until now, most drum recording setups were comparatively crude, with one or two mics placed at a distance from the drumheads and cymbals.", "As microphones became more robust and could handle close-mic'ing's environment of high sound pressure level (SPL), the tom was thrust into the sonic spotlight. Engineers were now unable to rely on the natural dissipation of less-pleasing overtones over the distance from the drum to the diaphragm of the mic, so tunable bottom heads—once a revelation gifted to the world by Slingerland and Krupa—were now being removed.", "Muffling was often applied to the batter head to further deaden the sustain, often in the form of a taped-on cigarette pack, or copious amounts of tea towels (as made famous by Ringo Starr, Geoff Emerick, and George Martin during The Beatles' late-'60s recording sessions).", 'Pretty soon, the tom would begin losing its resonant head and hardware altogether. Top LA session man and "Wrecking Crew" member Hal Blaine ordered a set of seven single-headed fiberglass toms from drum maker A.F. Blaemire. Their distinctive pale green finish was in stark contrast to the Sparkling Blue Pearl Ludwig Super Classic kit he normally toted to his recording dates.', 'The hollow, brittle snap of these "melodic" or "concert" toms was music to producers\' ears, and Blaine ordered a second set to cut down on the cost of constantly shipping the drums to studios across the US. Eventually, Ludwig sat up and began to take notice.', 'Ludwig, like most manufacturers, had been producing single-headed concert toms for band and orchestra settings for some years. By combining sets of these drums with standard kicks and snares, the company could produce an entirely new line of kits catered toward the modern pop musician at very low R&D cost. Thus, the massive Octa-Plus outfit was born.', 'Built around a complete eight-drum set of 6"–16" concert toms, the kit also featured twin 22" or 24" kicks, an 18" floor tom, and the ubiquitous LM400 snare. Along with its half-sized counterpart, the Quadra-Plus, these new kits set the standard for modern recording setups. Soon Rogers, Slingerland, Premier, and other major drum makers debuted similar multi-concert tom offerings.', 'Thankfully, the concert tom craze came and went, and the tom regrew its resonant appendage. This was due in part to stalwarts like John Bonham, Mitch Mitchell, and Buddy Rich—all of whom continued to use double-headed drums tuned up high, like the big band kits of old while the rest of the world was duct-taping and tea-toweling their tone to oblivion.', 'Still, as rock gave way to heavy metal in the 1980s and amps continued to get louder, drummers were still left searching for ways to increase the sonic presence of their playing. The answer, according to drum makers, was the extended-depth "power tom."', "Up until now, the depth of the tom had been anywhere between half to two-thirds the size of the drum's diameter, allowing the resonant head to react quickly and forcefully when the batter was struck. With the advent of the power tom, the depth grew two to four inches, resulting in a deeper, punchier attack and significantly reduced sustain from the resonant head.", 'But this increase in size meant that positioning and mounting was now somewhat difficult. What was once a compact 9x13" rack tom became a cumbersome 11" or 12" deep. Companies like Sonor and Slingerland took the concept to further extremes (with their Phonic Plus and Magnum lines, respectively), producing "square"-sized drums (10x10", 12x12").', "Mounting hardware was beefed up to accommodate the additional mass of the shells, and the traditional bracket and L-arm design gave way to large tubing, producing some impressive, albeit over-engineered rigs (see: Ludwig's Modular system and Rogers' Memriloc hardware).", "Heavier drummers like Iron Maiden's Nicko McBrain, Metallica's Lars Ulrich, and Slayer's Dave Lombardo embraced the power tom, along with many fusion and session musicians (most notably, Billy Cobham). But the dull thud of these cannon-like drums often required extensive post-production to achieve the desired tone.", "As the 20th century gave way to the 21st, advancements in drum mounting technology—like the Gauger RIMS system and Tama's Starcast mount—helped solve the sustain issues inherent in larger toms with heavy mounts by suspending the drum from its own hardware instead of penetrating the shell.", 'Meanwhile, popular music continued to diversify, reflected in the increasingly vast array of popular setup choices from manufacturers—from retro big band-style kits with large, traditional-depth drums to smaller fusion kits with shorter, "fast"-sized toms.', 'Thanks to this proliferation of new sub-genres, influences, and sounds, today\'s drummers enjoy an endless array of options when putting together a kit. Most major drum companies offer toms in sizes between 8" to 18" in a variety of depths, from thunderous power toms to ultra-resonant "short-stack" models.', "In many cases, what's old is new again, and most manufacturers are now offering traditionally sized kits modeled on the classics of the '50s and '60s, such as the Ludwig Legacy Classic and Sonor's Vintage Series. Companies like Ludwig, C&C, and Pearl are even building concert tom kits again (albeit on a custom-order basis), and power toms can still be had in most high-end lines, like DW's Collectors Series and Gretsch's USA Custom.", "In the end, the tom-tom—once a novelty relegated to the occasional ensemble hit or sound effect—has become an absolutely essential part of the musical fabric of the modern age. Though the drum kit as we know it wouldn't exist without the snare drum and bass drum pedal, it owes much to this humble little drum once imported from the Far East.", 'In Western music, the snare drum is the "lead" voice of the drum kit. For pop, rock, funk, and hip-hop, it provides a backbeat that cuts through the wall of vocal and instrumental sound to anchor the rhythm of the tune. In jazz and Westernized Latin music, it is often used for "comping"—a lyrical, conversational, and improvisatory role that plays call-and-response rhythms with the lead instrument or voice.', 'These leading roles are befitting of the snare drum\'s storied history as it evolved from the medieval "tabor" drum (with its distinctive gut-wire rattle) to the military "side drum," which was slung over the shoulder of a drummer who could amplify company leaders\' commands and provide a marching rhythm for ranks of soldiers through dry, rudimental patterns. Although these early developments are fascinating and certainly merit discussion, we\'re mainly concerned with how the snare evolved as it became an essential part of the modern drummer\'s setup. Without it, the drum kit as we know it simply wouldn\'t exist.', 'In the late 1800s, it was common for players to "double drum," playing both the snare and bass drum with sticks, which can be rightfully seen as the first concrete step in the evolution of the drum kit. The snares used at this time were relatively simple, featuring reinforced steam-bent single-ply shells (usually mahogany or walnut) with single-tension lugs, T-rods, and wooden hoops. Only one of the drumheads had tension adjustment and the strainers did not have quick engage/disengage levers.', 'A notable exception to this was an early metal-shelled drum owned by John Philip Sousa Band\'s Tom Mills. Manufactured by Sonor, the drum featured a 6.5x13" welded brass shell, metal hoops, and separate tension lugs.', "The robust timbre and revolutionary design of this drum caught the eye of a young Leedy sales agent by the name of William F. Ludwig. After months of pestering Mills, Ludwig purchased the drum and brought it directly to his boss, Ulysses G. Leedy, who promptly refused Ludwig's request to research and develop a similar model, as he believed metal was an unsuitable drum shell material. Ludwig began to develop a copy of the drum on his own, convinced that its superior construction and tone would be the key to standing out in the highly competitive drum market.", 'William and his brother Theo would go on to find great success with their newly-developed line of metal-shelled snares. Along with other technical advancements, such as the bass drum pedal and pedal-tuned timpani, the brothers developed a new "tube lug" design, joining the top and bottom single-tension lugs to reduce strain on the shell. Before long, their innovations would become industry standards, as competitors looked for ways to attain the high level of performance and reliability of Ludwig & Ludwig snare drums.', 'As drum technology continued to evolve through the \'20s and \'30s, two titans of the snare world were born that would have a lasting impact on drum design: the Ludwig DeLuxe "Black Beauty" and Slingerland Radio King.', 'Expanding on the popular all-metal brass snare drum models, Ludwig introduced the DeLuxe line around 1926. Available in a variety of depths and 14" or 15" diameters, the drum was a true masterpiece, featuring hand-engraved ornamentation, a variety of colored enamel choices, and even a gold-plated option dubbed the Triumphal model.', '1920s Ludwig DeLuxe Model "Black Beauty" Snare', '1920s Leedy Black Elite Snare', 'The gun-metal black version of this drum ultimately proved to be the most popular and before long, Leedy and Slingerland followed with their own takes on the design called the Black Elite and Black Beauty respectively. Although Slingerland was the first to use the term "Black Beauty" in its literature, the name would become synonymous with Ludwig\'s original DeLuxe model, in part due to the highly sought-after reissues released by Ludwig starting in the 1970s.', 'Despite the proliferation of metal-shelled drums, wooden models still retained immense popularity within big band and orchestral circles. In 1935, Slingerland released a new solid maple shell snare called the Broadcaster. After some pressure from competitor Gretsch, who already had a well-established "Broadkaster" drum line, Slingerland changed the name of their drums to Radio King.', "With its sleek, streamlined lug casings, hefty adjustable snare system, and eye-catching pearloid or sparkle wraps, the drum was a true work of art. Most famously used by Gene Krupa, the Radio King would become a staple of Slingerland's lineup, its single-ply shell providing a warm, boxy sound and superior sensitivity that captivated drummers for decades to come, from Jimmy Chamberlin and Neil Peart to Buddy Rich.", 'In 1941, Ludwig introduced its "Super Ludwig" line of snares, boasting the latest and greatest in drumming tech. Built around a reinforced mahogany or nickel-plated brass shell, the drum came in a 14" size, with a variety of depths available. The parallel snare system ensured even tension and each individual snare wire had an additional fine-tuning adjustment. Self-aligning art deco-esque "Imperial" tension lugs ensured there was no danger of stripping the threads if the heads were not seated dead-center and an internal tone control allowed the player to dial in the desired amount of dampening for any musical situation.', 'Ludwig reintroduced the Super Ludwig as a metal shell-only model in 1960, with a sleek new design. The Imperial lugs returned, sitting atop a beaded two-piece brass shell. Chrome-plated or clear-lacquer finishes were available, the former proving more popular but the latter allowing the rich lustre of the brass show through. The drum was available in 5x14" or 6.5x14" sizes, with the shallower version selling in far greater numbers. Deeper models, especially those with clear-lacquer shells, are exceedingly rare today.', 'The high cost of brass would cause Ludwig to rethink the design of the drum and around 1963, production switched to seamless spun aluminum shells. Two strainer designs were now offered: The standard P-83 equipped model was dubbed Supraphonic, while the drum sporting the parallel snare system was called Super Sensitive.', 'The dry, bright snap of these drums would prove an almost instant hit. Legends such as Mitch Mitchell, John Bonham, Hal Blaine, and countless others used the Supraphonic almost exclusively and before long, most outfits in the Ludwig catalog came equipped with the 5x14" LM400 model as standard.', 'Eventually, the "Supra" would come to be called the most recorded snare drum in history, and it remains a favorite for many professional players and hobbyists alike. Ludwig still produces the drum to this day and despite some additional options and hardware upgrades, its construction is essentially unchanged.', 'As if Ludwig didn\'t have enough of a claim to snare drum fame already, they reintroduced the legendary Black Beauty snare drum in 1976 with some modern improvements. Gone were the solid tube lugs, welded two-piece shells, and clip-style rims. Instead, the drum was modeled after the art deco look of the Supra, with 10 Imperial lugs sitting atop a seamless beaded shell. Brass was still the material of choice, as was the obligatory black-nickel plating. Available in Ludwig\'s standard 5x14" and 6.5x14" sizes, the drums could be had with either the usual P-85 Supraphonic snare strainer or the more expensive Super-Sensitive model.', "These drums would go on to become favorites of many top session players—even those who publicly endorsed other brands—and today, an original late-'70s Black Beauty can command prices in the $1000–$2000 range, with the limited edition hand-engraved models going for even more.", "Late '70s Ludwig Black Beauty Supraphonic", 'Tama Kenny Aronoff Signature Trackmaster Snare', "Today, nearly every major drum company produces some variety of Black Nickel-Plated Brass snare, from DW's Collector's Series to Tama's Trackmaster and Pearl's Sensitone. Ludwig still offers the reissued Black Beauty, now available with additional options like tube lugs, hammered shells, and die cast hoops, and it is still a perennial favorite that can be found on stages and in studios the world over.", 'By the \'60s and \'70s, snare drum sizes had become relatively standardized, with most companies offering 5x14" and 6.5x14" versions of their popular models. Some shallower "piccolo" drums (like the Ludwig Downbeat) and larger orchestral models (such as the Leedy Broadway) were offered as well.', 'However, the snare drum, like the rest of the kit, did not escape the "power" craze of the 1980s and would soon grow heftier as smaller drums went out of style. Shells got thicker and many drums were outfitted with additional lugs and beefier hardware. Perhaps the most memorable approaches to this new philosophy were the Ludwig Coliseum and Sonor HLD-590. Both 8x14" in size, they each sported no less than twelve tension rods per head.', 'The Coliseum bore Ludwig\'s now-standard 6-ply Maple shell and was available in a "slotted" configuration, which left nearly an inch gap in the middle of the drum shell for a shotgun-like attack. Meanwhile, in true Sonor fashion, the HLD-590 was an over-engineered masterpiece, with its hefty 30 pound sand-cast bronze shell decked out in chunky copper-plated hardware, complete with die-cast hoops and an unbelievably complicated (but beautifully designed) parallel snare system.', 'Needless to say, the main instigators of this trend were the rock and metal drummers of the time, like Twisted Sister\'s A.J. Pero (who used a bona-fide 12x14" Ludwig marching snare) and Motley Crue\'s Tommy Lee. In many fusion and pop circles, by contrast, standard-sized drums remained the weapon of choice. Steve Gadd used his 5x14" Ludwig Supraphonic on most sessions, Bill Bruford played a 6.5x14" Ludwig Super-Sensitive or Tama Mastercraft steel snare, and Neil Peart had his trusty 5x14" solid-shell Slingerland.', 'Eventually, the oversized snare trend would fade as drummers continued to gravitate towards the more expressive, studio-friendly nature of shallower models.', 'While the venerable Supraphonics, Black Beauties, and Radio Kings continued to reign supreme in many studio rigs, Japanese manufacturer Tama was working on a design that would go on to become a recording legend in its own right. Through their Mastercraft series (an array of high-end snare drums with various shell materials and hardware appointments) the company introduced a new metal-shelled model around 1980. One of the first commercially available sand-cast drums, this hefty beast was marketed as the "Bell Brass" drum even though in reality, its shell was composed of bronze. Its deafening rimshot, unparalleled sensitivity and musical yet controlled overtones, made it a natural favorite of many rock and pop engineers.', 'The 6.5x14" Mastercraft Bell Brass was truly in a class of its own, especially when paired with Tama\'s monstrous cast bronze hoops The drum is now regarded as something of the Black Beauty of its time, appearing on countless era-defining records in the 1990s and 2000s—from Metallica and System of a Down to Nirvana and Audioslave. Though Tama reissued the original iteration of the drum in 2014, the original models continue to command high prices and remain a true "holy grail" for many drum collectors.', 'Although shell material, hardware specifications, and sizes continuously evolved during the middle part of the 20th century, the basic elements of the snare drum remained relatively static: tension lugs and snare strainers bolted directly to the shell.', 'The first real quantum leap in snare design came from CB Percussion, an importer of entry-level kits and snares into the US. In the late 1970s, CB developed a method for outfitting snare hardware without penetrating the drum shell itself, increasing sustain and resonance.', 'Released under the CB700 series, these "Free Floating" drums were available in a variety of sizes with steel, brass, or maple shells. The lugs and strainer were attached to an aluminum ring that served as the resonant bearing edge and provided a base on which the drum shell proper would sit.', 'Pearl—which was involved in the manufacturing and distribution of some of CB\'s products—quickly took a liking to this design and licensed it for their own use. After debuting their updated version in the early \'80s, they would go on to expand the offerings to include aluminum and bronze shells, along with additional sizes like the shallow 3.5x14" piccolo snare (famously used by Toto drummer and studio legend, Jeff Porcaro).', 'These affordable drums offered a flexibility and highly resonant tonal quality that would prove to be wildly popular with rock and metal drummers. Pearl is still making select models today, expanding their shell offerings to include mahogany and acrylic.', "There is a duality in the nature of the modern snare drum, perhaps indicative of a musical landscape that seems to be of two minds. On the one hand, retro has never been hotter, as popular music continues to retread and expand upon territory first explored in the folk and rock movements of the '50s and '60s. Meanwhile, genre barriers are collapsing as musicians find new ways to collaborate with each other without respecting the boundaries of old.", 'For the 21st century drummer, the snare is the ultimate expression of this individuality, which is reflective of the staggering array of options available from tube lugs to offset, 5x10" to 8x15", and acrylic to zelkova wood. And yet, for all its variety, the snare has not forgotten its past, and homages to the classics can be found in product lineups from nearly every manufacturer. From the Radio King-esque solid shell offerings of Craviotto and Dunnet, to the split-shell Coliseum reissues from Ludwig and tube lug-adorned beaded shell drums from Joyful Noise (recalling the ornately designed drums of the 1920s and \'30s), the snare drum is an instrument both on the cutting edge of musical evolution and positively steeped in its own history.', 'From the gargantuan wallop of rock gods like Bonzo and Cozy Powell to the machine gun assault of metal drummers like Chris Adler and Thomas Haake, the bass drum has cemented itself firmly into the legacy of western music.', "Indeed, as one of the first few components to coalesce into the drum kit proper in the early 20th century, the bass drum's importance cannot be overstated. Its evolution from thunderous concert hall mainstay, to jazzy melodic tone, and back to a stadium-filling thud has been in lockstep with popular music and recording tech trends throughout the 20th century.", "Here are a few snapshots on the bass drum's long and storied history.", "In truth, the bass drum as a kit component can't really be discussed without first addressing the advent of the modern bass drum pedal. Without it, we may never have developed the quintessential sideways floor-standing kick drum—perhaps the most instantly recognizable feature of the modern kit.", 'While early 1900s Vaudeville and concert hall musicians were "doubling up" by playing both snare and bass drum parts with sticks, a pair of young Chicago drummers called William and Theo Ludwig began developing a pedal contraption that would allow drummers to use both hands to play snare parts without sacrificing the ability to play the bass drum.', "Though the Ludwigs' bass drum pedal was not the first of its kind (inventive drummers had been experimenting with crude homemade wooden contraptions for some years), it was far and away the best by design—all-metal construction, lightweight and collapsible, with adjustable spring tension. Starting with this contraption, the Ludwig family name would become ubiquitous in the world of drums.", 'The big 28" and 30" bass drums common in the orchestra pits of the day were cumbersome enough to play already, so the pedal was an almost overnight success with working drummers due to its superior response.', 'Other companies quickly followed suit, and soon, small metal bass drum pedals with large lambswool beaters could be had from the likes of Leedy, Slingerland, and others. This arms—or, rather, feet—race would spark a trend in bass drum pedal innovation that continues to this day.', 'By the late 1920s, two and three-piece drum kits were becoming commonplace, especially in the burgeoning big band scene. The bass drum was the centerpiece of the kit, both visually and structurally, and was adorned with everything from woodblocks, traps tables, and cymbal arms to internal lights and elaborately painted scenes on the resonant head.', "However, the primitive recording technology of the day wasn't really up to the task of capturing the low-end attack of such large drums, which were still usually around 26 to 28 inches in diameter. This meant that the bass drum remained largely absent from the recordings of the day, deferring to snare drums, woodblocks, and cymbals to carry the beat.", 'A 1930s Ludwig & Ludwig kit in Peacock Pearl. The 14x28" bass drum features factory original "Mountain & Lake" painted head', 'Its 14x28" bass drum featuring faded band logo and modest console rail make this 1939 Leedy kit the typical gigging drummer\'s setup of the era', 'But by the \'30s and \'40s, as microphones became better suited to low frequency capture, the bass drum finally made its way onto the airwaves. Anchoring many upbeat swing-era hits with a four-on-the-floor pulse, the boisterous drum was now a dance band essential, often sporting the name of the drummer or group on the calfskin reso head for maximum publicity at live events (or on the new-fangled gadget called "television").', 'Additionally, as the modern tom evolved and cymbal selection widened, drum companies began outfitting their high-end kits with "consoles"—massive tubular steel contraptions mounted on top of the bass drum designed to hold the drummer\'s growing arsenal of ancillary percussion instruments.', 'Following World War II, the bass drum—like the rest of the kit—began to standardize along genre lines and became more like the drum we know today. Big band players like Buddy Rich still favored larger 14X24" and 14X26" drums for their ability to hold high tunings and keep a deep pitch, while rock \'n\' roll and blues players favored the smaller 14X22" for their attack and punch (not to mention portability).', 'Meanwhile, as bebop was taking its first steps, drummers like Max Roach, Kenny Clarke, and Elvin Jones gravitated towards smaller drums, tuned higher to form a more cohesive melodic unit with the toms.', 'Smaller kits like this 1966 Ludwig Jazzette (with 12x18" bass drum featuring a shell-mounted consolette and cymbal bracket) typified mid-century bop kits', 'The Gretsch Name Band outfit featured a 14x22" bass drum popular with jazz drummers', 'At first, the 14X20" was the go-to option. Later on, even smaller 14X18" and 12X18" drums would become the norm. Hardware had changed, as well. Gone were the massive consoles of the swing era, replaced with downsized "consolette" rails and shell-mounted cymbal arm brackets.', 'This diversification can be seen in the explosion of different outfits offered by manufacturers as the \'50s gave way to the \'60s. Kits with larger-diameter bass drums, like Slingerland\'s Gene Krupa Deluxe and the Gretsch Broadkaster "Name Band," could be seen alongside the Rogers Orbit and Ludwig Jazzette, which featured 20" and 18" bass drums, respectively.', 'In addition, the early double bass antics of showier, big band drummers like Louie Bellson meant it was also possible to order massive dual-kick, tri/quad-tom kits (see: the Ludwig Blue Note and Slingerland Duet outfits), though the price kept these out of the hands of many working pros and hobbyists.', "As the '60s came to a close and studio tech evolved once again, the bass drum fell victim to the same deadened, close-mic'd approach used on tom-toms.", 'Drummers like Ringo Starr of the Beatles and John Densmore of the Doors began removing the resonant head to achieve a more attack-heavy sound. Pillows, blankets, and felt strips were also added inside of the drum, exaggerating the effect.', "The result was a far cry from the bass drum's echoing, thunderous origins, but translated to the recorded media of the day perfectly. The defined low-end attack sailed under the bass guitar and lower-register vocals beautifully.", "Manufacturers did eventually offer true single-headed bass drums on some outfits, like Slingerland's Pop Outfit No. 58N and the Ludwig Standard Single Six, but these did not prove overwhelmingly popular.", 'Rather than ditching the front head altogether, many players ended up simply cutting holes in their resonant heads to achieve the same effect, which meant no risk of losing or misplacing reso hoops and hardware or damaging the exposed drum shell.', 'Building on the prior successes of bands like Cream, Vanilla Fudge, and Deep Purple, hard-hitting arena rock climbed towards its zenith in the 1970s with a new crop of heavy-hitters. As these drummers began looking for ways to compete with massive guitar rigs, the size of the bass drum began to grow once again.', 'Aside from drummers like Neil Peart and Nick Mason embracing the multi-tom, double-bass setup, players like Carmine Appice, John Bonham, and Simon Kirke were all using big 26" bass drums that wouldn\'t have seemed out of place on the big band stage a couple decades prior.', 'These larger drums made a bold sonic and visual statement that could be heard on the recordings of the day. Most notably, Led Zeppelin\'s "When The Levee Breaks" featured Bonham\'s 14X26" Ludwig echoing through the stair hall of Headley Grange mansion (along with a fair amount of compression).', 'Simon Kirke\'s 1970s Ludwig kit, complete with 14x28" bass drum and oversized toms', 'Kits with 24" bass drums soon became standard, like this 1970s Slingerland Super Rock', 'Once again, drum makers looked to capitalize on this trend by expanding their product lineups. Soon, kits like the Ludwig Pro Beat, Gretsch Broadkaster II, and Slingerland Classic Rock (which all featured 24" bass drums and multiple rack toms) could be seen alongside more traditional offerings.', 'By the end of the \'70s, this trend had reached a fever pitch, with setups like the Ludwig Power Rock Outfit, which, in its ultimate guise, featured twin 14X26" kicks, 14" and 15" rack toms, and 18" and 20" floor toms.', 'Yet despite this over-the-top approach, the bass drum still had one more growth spurt to come…', 'As with the rest of the kit, the bass drum could not escape the influence of the "decade of excess." The 1980 hit and hit hard, bringing along big hair, big sounds, and bigger bass drums. For the first time ever, mass-produced kits with deeper drums became the standard.', 'Power toms, marching-style snares, and deep "beer can" bass drums were favored for their reduced sustain, pronounced attack, and extreme looks. Sonor began producing 18" deep kicks in its Phonic Plus and Signature ranges, while Ludwig, Slingerland, and others stuck to a slightly more reasonable 16".', 'But this was still not enough for some, and French manufacturer Capelle thought they had the answer with their "Turbo" line. Anchored around insane 32" deep kick drums, this series featured power toms in sizes ranging from 6 to 20 inches and was also sold under license by the UK-based Orange company (yes, the amp brand).', "Along with Italy's Meazzi and their HiPercussion series, Europe held down the extreme bass drum contingent for a time being, until a handful of prominent American drummers took note of this trend.", 'Alex Van Halen—who had already been joining his traditionally sized Ludwig bass drums together end-to-end for years—finally had the company produce several extremely deep kicks for his 1988 tour kit. Similarly, Eric Carr of Kiss fame began using pairs of single-headed Ludwig kicks joined together, but would go on to use custom made single-shell deep kicks toward the end of his life.', 'Ludwig even produced a few of these "Thunder Kick" bass drums for the public on a custom order basis, but their rarity and narrow appeal makes them extremely hard to come by today.', "Thankfully, the bass drum's excessive inflation was curtailed somewhat as the 21st century rolled around, and companies began offering a variety of depths to suit drummers' varying tastes.", 'Though many "standard" kits now come with 18" deep drums, what\'s old is new again, and kits in a range of price points—like Ludwig\'s Legacy series, C&C\'s Player Date, and the Gretsch Catalina Club—all offer traditional 14" depth bass drums for a warmer, more retro sound and aesthetic.', 'Today, younger drummers are discovering the depth of tone possible from shallower kicks, and older players are reliving their youth with reissues based on the classic setups of players like Bonham, Buddy, Ringo, and others.', 'Still, among metal and pop punk communities especially, the sonic and visual appeal of a deep bass drum with smaller diameters remains strong. Drums like Tama\'s Starclassic and Mapex\'s Saturn V (both popular with heavier drummers) feature 18" or 20" bass drum depths. The myriad of custom companies that popped up in the early 2000s (SJC, OCDP, Truth, and others) also built thousands of kits with 18" to 22" deep bass drums.', "Once again, like today's snare and tom options, we drummers are spoiled for choice, living in a golden age of customization and individuality. Nearly every major drum company offers kits in every series configured around a variety of bass drum sizes and shell types.", "From the ultra-retro styling and large, shallow kicks of sets A&F Drum Co's Field Series and PDP's Concept Classic, to the modern versatility and deeper drums of Tama's Silverstar and the Gretsch Renown, there's a kit out there for just about anyone, with a bass drum to suit.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

They point gleefully at the camera. They punch the air. They generally seem to be having a great time helping to celebrate the success story of Charvel/Jackson Guitars.', 'Among the 15 guys crammed into Glen La Ferman’s Hollywood photo studio are Steve Vai from Alcatrazz, Jake E. Lee from Ozzy Osbourne’s band, and Steve Lynch from Autograph. Each of them brandishes a Charvel bolt-on or a Jackson through-neck, several of which have flashy paint jobs and striking graphics. A couple of the guitarists—Vinnie Vincent, lately of Kiss, and Michael Sweet of Stryper—are hanging on to their very fancy V-shape Randy Rhoads models.', 'This jolly gathering marked how popular Charvel/Jackson had become in a few short years. When the ad went to print, its headline declared: "Success. It’s The Company You Keep." Or, as Grover Jackson puts it today: "We were the 800-pound gorilla in the early ‘80s." He’s recalling the dominant position his firm enjoyed among rock guitarists and guitar makers at the time, and adds: "Everybody was copying us."', 'It had all begun in humbler circumstances when Wayne Charvel opened Charvel’s Guitar Repair, a small shop on East Arrow Highway in Azusa, California, in 1974. Wayne had been playing guitar in nightclub bands for 15 years, but on the birth of his first son he decided it was about time he tried something with more family-friendly hours.', 'He knew how to repair guitars, and his friend Bob Luly recommended getting some premises. "Bob said I’d do better if I had a shop," Wayne remembers, "because people respect it more if you’re doing repairs in a shop as opposed to your garage. Bob was a genius electronics guy—he showed me how to put a variable AC transformer on my Fender Showman. It meant I could still crank it up so it would break up real nice, but it wasn’t so loud that the club owners would complain. Bob wound up making gigantic PA systems for all the big names."', 'As well as doing refinishing work for Fender, Wayne started offering guitar parts at his shop as demand dictated, and soon he began a mail-order operation. The first piece, offered from late ’74 and made by a friend with a metal press, was a $2.50 aluminum Les Paul jack plate intended as a replacement for the breakable original. More items followed in a similar, practical vein for Strats: a trem arm, a chrome-plated aluminum pickguard, and a white single-layer plastic pickguard.', 'By late ’76, Charvel Manufacturing offered an array of parts, almost all aimed at players who wanted Fender replacements or custom upgrades. There were more pickguards and plates, but also a series of raw bodies in Tele, Strat, or P-Bass style for "kit builders, repairmen, and the guitarist who wants to improve his sound with a better, heavier wood." A few months later, Charvel added matching necks to its ads. The bodies and necks were supplied at various times by Schecter, based in Reseda, and Boogie Bodies, up near Tacoma, Washington.', 'Alongside these in the ads was what Charvel called a "1952 Telecaster kit," supplied by Cathy and Seymour Duncan’s fledgling operation, offered for $36, and comprising a set of three brass bridge pieces, two chrome dome knobs, and a black single-layer pickguard which, it was claimed, could "convert your late model Telecaster to that old vintage look." A small note at the side reminded the prospective client: "Guitar not included."', 'Wayne’s offers chimed with the times, as some players developed a taste for kit building and upgrading. Fender in particular was pouring out more guitars than ever but at the cost of a slipping reputation for quality control. That fueled a growing interest in what were now for the first time being called vintage guitars, and also a do-it-yourself trend for improving or even creating your own instrument.', 'During the second half of 1977, Wayne moved about five miles east to new premises off West Gladstone Street in San Dimas, next to railroad tracks near the 57 freeway. It was there that the most influential of the new do-it-yourselfers came to visit, a young guitarist by the name of Edward Van Halen.', '"Eddie and Mike Anthony, the bass player, would come over," Wayne remembers, "and Eddie loved guitars, he liked to work on them. I knew he didn’t have any money, so I gave him stuff. I don’t suppose he had any tools, either, because the first guitar I ever saw, he had nailed the pickup into the body. But it worked! He’d sit on the floor in my shop there and noodle around on the guitar, and I thought wow, this guy’s really good. It’s so rare that anybody makes it in the business, and I thought, well, this guy’s got a chance at doing it."', 'Ed put together his black-and-white Frankenstrat, as seen on the front of the first Van Halen album released early in 1978, using one of Wayne’s Strat-style bodies and a neck, both probably from the stock supplied by Lynn Ellsworth at Boogie Bodies. Ed added a PAF humbucker from a 335, swapped in some jumbo Gibson frets, and screwed on his Strat’s vibrato and a single control for volume. The rest is most certainly history.', 'Wayne had various employees through the shop’s existence, including future guitar makers like Karl Sandoval. The most significant came along when Grover Jackson started working at the San Dimas location in September 1977. Grover grew up in Tennessee, a guitarist and vintage fan with an eye and ear for choice golden-era instruments. He moved to California and worked for a few years for Anvil Cases and then briefly, in the summer of ’77, at Westwood Music in Los Angeles. But retail was not for him. Perhaps he could again earn a living as a guitarist?', 'Grover decided to build himself a guitar, so he went to see Wayne Charvel to get a body. They ended up going for lunch, where Wayne admitted he was worried he might go out of business thanks to problems with a supplier. Added to that, Wayne told Grover he was overwhelmed by the weight of orders coming in and the practicalities of running the operation.', '"I’d never done this before, I didn’t know about business," Wayne says. "I was going through a lot of stress, and I just couldn’t handle it. We were always behind the eight ball money-wise. I remember one week, the bank called and said you’ve got a $1,400 overdraft. This was a Wednesday or Thursday and I knew I had to make payroll. I had a Mustang convertible and I had to sell that, just to make payroll. So even though you’re selling a lot of parts and making money, you have to have a lot of money in reserve to keep it going. I didn’t realize that. I learned that real fast."', 'Meanwhile, budding entrepreneur Grover Jackson sensed an opportunity at the lunch counter in San Dimas. "I said to Wayne, ‘Wait a minute, I can save your business. I’ll not take any wages, but in lieu of wages, can I have ten percent of the company if I can save it?’" That continued from ’77 to the late summer of ’78, when Grover says it had become clear that Wayne had had enough. "By this point," Wayne says, "I was so disgusted with the whole thing that I didn’t care about the money or anything. Just get it out of my hair, you know?"', 'Wayne and Grover came to an agreement where Grover bought the business, in November 1978. By the end of January in the new year, Grover and his wife JoAnn Pieroth had their first employee, 18-year-old guitarist Mike Eldred. Mike arrived at the San Dimas workshop one day after a tipoff from Ed Van Halen. He’d known Ed for a while, mainly through backstage guitar chats, and he’d followed Ed’s progress through a series of eccentric guitars. First they seemed relatively normal—a white Ibanez, a Goldtop—but then one night up in the dressing room at the Whisky, Ed showed Mike a distinctly unusual Fender.', '"It was a black rosewood-neck Strat," Mike recalls, "and he’d painted a little white pinstripe around the edge. It had a stock tremolo, and a mint-green pickguard that he’d cut out and put a humbucker in the back. I went wow, this is so crazy—and it sounded killer! Fast forward a couple of months, again at the Whisky, I go in the dressing room and he has this black-and-white striped guitar. I’m like, ‘What the fuck is that?’ He goes, ‘I built it myself, I got a body and a neck from Charvel Manufacturing.’ I asked where they were at. He goes, ‘They’re in San Dimas and they sell bodies and necks.’ I’m thinking OK, I gotta get one. So he gave me the phone number."', 'Mike called Charvel and went to meet Grover to sort out the kind of guitar he’d like, handed over a deposit, and after that would make regular visits to pay off the balance. On one such occasion, and fed up with his job at a late-night grocery store that severely limited his opportunities to play music, he asked Grover if he was hiring.', '"Grover said to me, ‘You don’t want to work here, you’ll mess your hands up—you’re a guitar player.’ I said I really needed to find a different job. So I filled in a form and I got the job," Mike remembers. "My motivation was that I just wanted to play music, but I had to put gas in the car, so I needed a job. And if I was getting a custom guitar made, what better scam is there than to go work at the place where my guitar is getting built? One, I’ll probably get a break on the guitar, and two, I’ll probably be able to build it myself, right there, using his tools. But then all around me, it grew really, really fast. Grover started hiring other people after me, and soon we were building so much stuff left and right."', 'The team at the San Dimas workshop by the railroad tracks did indeed expand beyond the original trio of Grover, JoAnn, and Mike. After hiring Tim Wilson and Mike Shannon from a local firm called Woodworkers, they made guitar bodies for Mighty Mite and later for DiMarzio. And soon they had a set of Charvel guitars ready to show off to the music trade at the June 1979 NAMM show in Atlanta.', '"Probably the very first Charvel guitars that were sold on any kind of real commercial level were sold at that show," Grover recalls. "We sold them to some of our good friends from the Anvil days, a music shop called Veneman Music in the DC area. At that stage, these were Strat-style guitars in mahogany, oil finished and not painted."', 'Then along came Randy Rhoads. The guitarist’s first album with Ozzy Osbourne, Blizzard Of Ozz, was released in Britain in 1980, and Randy decided he’d like a new guitar to go along with his Les Paul Custom and Karl Sandoval V. Just before Christmas 1980, he went to see Grover Jackson at the San Dimas workshop. "Randy took out this little cocktail napkin," Grover recalls, "with kind of a line drawing on it, like four or five angular lines. And that was his contribution—it was his idea to do the pointy thing. I added on the head as we scribbled and scratched around. That’s how the original Rhoads guitar was born."', 'Grover had made a few earlier through-neck V-style guitars for an Italian guitarist, Vic Vergeat. But Randy’s was the first with a Jackson logo on the head rather than Charvel, Grover apparently thinking he didn’t want this unusual design to clash too obviously with the developing Charvel line. Around March ’81, Randy took delivery of his new Jackson, which had a pointy offset-V body finished in white with black pinstripe detailing. There was a vibrato bridge, two humbuckers and four controls, a block-inlay board, and Grover’s take on a droopy Explorer-style headstock. Randy immediately put the instrument to good use, but soon he was thinking about a more extreme design. Randy told Grover that people would ask if his white guitar was a butchered job on a real Flying V. "So now he wanted something more sharkfin-like," Grover says.', 'Randy came over again and they worked on a new design. They’d lay down the original template, trace around that, Randy suggesting a little more here, a little less there. "Then we’d erase it or sand it off, and then redraw it," Grover says. "Finally, he said, ‘Yeah, that’s it, let’s do it!’ I said I’d take it over to the bandsaw and hack it out. And he said, ‘Oh, I can’t watch that,’ so he went in the office. I hacked it out, and then I took it into the office and said, ‘Is this about what you’re talking about?’ He said ‘Yeah, that’s great!’ And that’s how the RR design was done."', 'Randy commissioned three guitars with the new design, but only the first, in black, was completed for him. The immediately distinctive feature of the new body design was the extended upper wing—the familiar RR shape that the current iteration of the Jackson company still sells to this day. Randy took one on what would be his last US tour, beginning in December ’81, but he never had a chance to tell Grover about the tweaks he wanted for the remaining two guitars. He was killed in a plane crash in March ’82 at the age of just 26. The influence both of his playing and the style of the guitars he used has grown ever since.', 'A useful indicator of the speed with which the Charvel operation grew around this time comes with the moves they made from the original 1,200-square-feet location in San Dimas. Around the turn of 1979 into ’80, the firm added a further 1,200-square-feet unit across the street—and technically across the city line, too, off East Gladstone Street in neighboring Glendora. Around the middle of 1980, the Glendora location was expanded to 2,400 square feet, while the original San Dimas location was closed (much later, the buildings were demolished to make way for a Costco parking lot). About two years later, a further 4,800 square feet was added at Glendora—and logo-spotters should note that, despite these moves, guitar neckplates kept a San Dimas address throughout this period.', 'A flyer from around this time shows the Charvel line consisting largely of Fender-influenced models, but with distinct signs of the times. For a while, there was a Strat shape and a four-point Star shape (and basses with P-Bass or Explorer shape). Alder bodies and maple necks were matched with wide and flatter 11-inch radius fingerboards and jumbo frets, in accordance with growing trends, along with DiMarzio or Duncan pickups, all adding to the vibe of a custom shop prepared to put together more or less whatever combination of features the musician wanted.', 'Mike Eldred remembers the way things took off at this time. "It just went insane," he says. "One day quite soon after I started, Grover says to me hey, Billy Gibbons is coming by tonight if you want to hang out. I was just 18 years old then, and I’m like Yeah! So, waited and waited, and Billy didn’t show up till about nine o clock that night, but he came in this big silver limousine, had on this silver cowboy hat, he brought records and signed them for me, we talked for a long time. Man, it was a trip." Word travelled fast about the hip workshop where they offered what they called "an infinite variety of opportunities to participate in the design of your instrument."', 'Grover says of the multitude of players he’s worked with, Jeff Beck holds a special place. "There’s nobody on the planet like him, you know? Those notes he plays don’t appear on a regular guitar! It’s more like sonic sculpture with Jeff. So it was a real highlight for me to make guitars for him. The first was the pink one, and when I went to deliver it to him—this would have been late 1983—he was sitting around the pool at the Sunset Marquis in LA. We chatted for a while, and then he kind of lifted his chin up, looked at the case I had, and said, ’Is that the guitar? I guess we better have a look.’"', 'Jeff and Grover and the pink Jackson in its case went up to his room. "He sits down on the bed with a Pignose amplifier and starts playing," Grover remembers, "and he offers me a Rockman and some headphones to listen to some of his new stuff while he checks out the guitar. I listen for a bit, then lift up the headphones. And he’s sitting on the bed playing my guitar, playing all the stuff from Truth. It was the most goddamn surreal experience of my life! I’m sitting across the room from the guy who’s my hero, he’s playing my guitar, and he’s playing the songs that changed my life. It’s moments like that that are just so precious to me."', 'Mike’s precious moments are many, too. "We were making guitars for Gary Moore, and he came in one time, says, ‘Can we go look at wood? I want a really heavy guitar.’ So we go out back, and we’re literally climbing in the wood bins. We’re pulling out pieces of wood, and he’d hold them up, looking for the heaviest piece of wood he could find. And he’s covered with dust, this Irish rock star, having a blast being part of the process. There was stuff like that all the time."', 'The Rhoads guitar had established the idea for the Jackson brand alongside Charvel, and soon the catalogues were calling the operation Charvel/Jackson, with a flurry of instruments pictured inside with one or other of the brandnames. The general distinction at the time was that Charvel guitars were bolt-on and Jackson guitars were neck-through-body. What became known as the superstrat style was taking shape, too, primarily as the Jackson models were offered with 24 frets (following a request from Sammy Hagar’s guitarist, Gary Pihl), hum and sing pickups were arranged in various "new" combinations, and locking trems were installed.', 'The catalogues boasted openly about the fancy finishes Charvel/Jackson was becoming known for. "We have spent a great deal of time perfecting our paint department," ran the blurb, hyping on all cylinders, "so we could offer something that no guitar maker has ever been able to offer before: Absolutely no color or design limitations." It seemed natural to exploit the local talent for extravagant hot-rod style paint jobs on cars and vans and apply them to guitars."You really could have whatever you wanted—that was the cool thing about it," Mike remembers. "People would bring in artwork and say, ‘Can you do this?’ And we were: ‘Yeah, no problem.’" The results included multicolor flames and stripes and concentric patterns and so on, as well as more personally meaningful creations.', 'In 1985, Grover made an alliance with the Texas-based wholesaler International Music Corporation, and at the same time moved his operation about 15 miles east from Glendora to 28,000 square feet of space in Ontario, California. As part of the new deal, the Charvel brand was shifted to made-in-Japan guitars, while Jackson remained as the exclusive US-made brand. And that marks the start of another story for another day.', 'Mike has great affection for the early days of the company, before the IMC liaison. "Every once in a while, I’d be out in the shop, assembling a guitar, and I’d play it and go holy crap. I’d get up, walk into Grover’s office, say, ‘You got a minute? I need you to come play this guitar.’ We’d walk out, and for the next hour and a half we’d both be sitting there, passing the guitar back and forth, playing it, talking about it, telling stories, listening to it, and doing some more holy crap. Sometimes Grover wouldn’t want to sell the guitar—he’s saying, ‘Oh, I’m gonna keep this one.’ And I’m like, ‘Dude, somebody ordered this!’"', 'A high point for Grover was working with Allan Holdsworth, a magnificent guitarist’s guitarist if ever there was such a creature. They’d met in London in 1982 as Grover took a detour on his way home from the trade show in Frankfurt, Germany, and then a few months later, Allan was in LA. Grover said he’d do whatever he could to help, the most obvious being to make him a guitar—but also at various times he felt like Allan’s roadie or his manager, and he let Allan, drummer Chad Wackerman, and bassist Jeff Berlin rehearse at the shop in Glendora. Much later, when Allan died in 2017, Grover found himself at the remembrance service, captivated by Steve Vai’s eulogy.', '"Steve said Allan had told him that what was most important to him was to leave a body of work that was untouched, that was just him," Grover says. "Managers, producers, engineers—nobody had their finger on this body of work but him. In that moment, I realized that, right or wrong, there was an intention there. On the outside it may have looked incredibly wrong. Self-destructive, even. I mean, Allan was a guy who could have earned a very good living, and he seemed to deliberately try not do that. But he had a longterm vision, and that gave me a profound new respect for what he did. Ultimately, he stayed true to a purpose. And I can’t fault that."', 'POSTSCRIPT: Grover would leave Charvel/Jackson in 1989, working later with Washburn, his own GJ2 brand, and Friedman. Mike would leave Charvel/Jackson in 1983, return 1985–87, and run the Fender Custom Shop 1997–2014. Grover and Mike are currently planning a new project together. Wayne would launch Wayne Guitars in 1999. Charvel/Jackson was acquired in 1997 by Akai and then in 2001 by Fender, which is where the two brands still reside today.', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

At which point there's a step change—and not only because of the emergence of the magnetic tape recorder. At the same time, electronic music pioneers embraced a more prosaic piece of electronic equipment: the audio test oscillator.", 'In electronic music, the tape recorder was adapted from its primary purpose (recording sound) to a new one (manipulating sound). The test oscillator was reimagined in a similar way.', "Test oscillators typically generate a sine wave, the frequency or pitch of which is controlled by a large rotary dial, and they are designed to measure the response of electrical circuits. They're often used with oscilloscopes, where you put the wave through a piece of kit and see what comes out the other end.", 'However, once sonic explorers cottoned on to the musical potential of an infinitely variable tone, the test oscillator became a preferred sound source, one that could be manually "played," by turning the dial, and processed, through tape editing and filters. And in the years after the end of World War II, there was a glut of military-surplus oscillators. So they were going cheap.', 'As is often the way at the intersection of music and technology, lots of people had similar ideas at the same time. The founding figures of British electronic music, Tristram Cary and Daphne Oram, were both born in 1925. Both attended private schools, and both showed some early musical promise. And by the end of World War II, both were ruminating on the possibilities of electronic sound in music.', 'In 1943, Oram started worked at the BBC as a junior studio engineer and music balancer. That same year, Cary joined the Navy as a radar operator. Both jobs involved using test oscillators. Cary left the Navy in 1946 and began building "the Machine," a ragbag of gadgets mounted on an old table and intended to make electronic music. In time, it would incorporate a disc-cutting lathe, which he bought with his demobilization pay, and a collection of military-surplus oscillators.', 'From the late \'40s, news of the experiments in musique concrète in Paris and then elektronische musik in Cologne began to filter through to London. Pierre Schaeffer in Paris held to the principle of manipulating "real" sounds using disc-cutting lathes and tape.', "Karlheinz Stockhausen studied with Schaeffer in 1952 and learned tape-editing techniques before moving to Cologne in '53 to work at the newly established Studio for Electronic Music of the West German Radio in Cologne. Here, the favored audio raw material was electronically created sound, and the proposed sources were two early instruments, the Monochord and the Melochord. Stockhausen thought them limiting and advocated using oscillator sine waves as compositional building blocks, demonstrating his approach with Studie I and Studie II in 1953 and '54.", 'In the UK, Oram in particular looked on in envy, as the Paris and Cologne studios were located in and funded by state radio stations. It took a while for the BBC to catch up. Gradually, though, whispers from the electronic future were heard over the airwaves. In 1955, Cary soundtracked a BBC radio play, The Japanese Fisherman, with manipulated percussive hits and oscillator drones, the first electronic score on British radio.', "In 1957, Oram used tape recorders, oscillators, and filters to create music for a BBC TV adaptation of Amphitryon 38, by the French dramatist Jean Giraudoux. Broadcast in March the following year, this was the first electronic score on British television. Although palpably alien compared to any music performed on conventional instruments, Oram's score was recognizably musical. Where Cary's Fisherman piece was closer to what we'd now call sound design, Oram extracted an almost woodwind-like melody from the oscillators.", "By the time Amphitryon 38 was broadcast, Oram, along with Desmond Briscoe, was lobbying the BBC to set up what would become the Radiophonic Workshop. This opened on April Fools' Day 1958, in Maida Vale, west London, under the leadership of Oram and Briscoe. History doesn't record a comprehensive list of equipment in the workshop when it opened. It's known that Oram and Briscoe acquired assorted tape recorders, turntables, and oscillators from other BBC departments along with a pre-war mixing board from the Royal Albert Hall. Louis Niebur's book Special Sound lists some new equipment bought with a budget of £1,900, including a Muirhead One Decade D-650B Oscillator that cost £313.", "Although the Workshop acquired a couple of large electronic keyboard instruments in the early days, oscillators remained its choice source of electronic sound until the late '60s and the arrival of EMS synthesizers. Photos from a few years after the Workshop opened show banks of oscillators controlled by a single-octave keyboard. Delia Derbyshire used an oscillator for the top melody line of her famed Doctor Who theme (1962).", 'During the same period in the US, popular and serious electronic composers were joining in. Bernard Herrmann used oscillator swoops alongside twin Theremins in the soundtrack to The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951). Composer Pauline Oliveros, later a prime mover in the San Francisco Tape Music Center, deployed oscillators in her early work. Talking to Steve Silverstein toward the end of her life, Oliveros said:', '"I made my own way of making electronic music in the late \'50s, early \'60s, using test equipment—oscillators and patchbays and tape recorders. … I was finding a way to improvise with the electronics. That improvisation system was using difference tones between oscillators. Setting oscillators above the range of hearing and using the difference tones between the oscillators in a tape delay system caused a lot of beat frequencies with the bias of the tape recorder."', "Louis and Bebe Barron had started to combine tape manipulation techniques with oscillator tones in the late '40s, though unusually it seems that Louis made their oscillators himself. The couple embarked on several projects with avant-garde film makers before their one mainstream commercial triumph, the score for Forbidden Planet (1956). By then, rock 'n' roll was on the way to becoming the dominant popular music genre, though it was a few years before oscillators found their place amid the electric guitars, basses, and drum kits.", "Paul Tanner was a session trombonist who'd played for Frank Sinatra. In a 1958 film soundtrack session, he witnessed a Thereminist struggling to pitch his instrument to the orchestra. This prompted Tanner to fashion a home-made instrument he called the electro-theremin. It was simply a test oscillator in a box with a manual slider, with notes marked on the box as a guide.", 'Tanner used his gadget for TV themes and various sessions. And then, famously, he got a call from Brian Wilson. This led to Tanner appearing on several Beach Boys songs, including "Good Vibrations" (1966). Around the time "Good Vibrations" was released, The Rolling Stones were recording Between The Buttons. The UK edition featured Brian Jones turning the dial of a test oscillator over a Bo Diddley rhythm on "Please Go Home." A year later, Brian was pulling the same trick on the Satanic Majesties album.', 'The Beach Boys and the Stones were just two examples of a trend at the time, when rock musicians went questing for new sounds—including, but not limited to, electronic sound. In the US in particular, this experimental drive gave rise to several underground bands who moved far closer to an entirely electronic approach than any contemporaneous mainstream acts. These included The United States of America, Fifty Foot Hose, and Silver Apples. What all these bands had in common was a reliance on one-off, hand-built oscillator-based instruments.', 'Silver Apples, a duo comprising Danny Taylor and Simeon Coxe, took this further than anyone. Taylor was the drummer, while Coxe manned what the sleevenotes to the band\'s debut described as "nine audio oscillators piled on top of each other and 86 manual controls to control lead, rhythm, and bass pulses with hands, feet, and elbows." This eccentric creation had no piano-style keyboard. Instead, Coxe triggered the oscillators through a selection of telegraph keys and foot pedals. It grew over time, too, with Coxe adding more oscillators and effects units and housing the lot in a collection of custom-made cabinets.', "Silver Apples was a going concern for a few years, touring America and releasing two albums, while never achieving commercial success. Their highest-profile appearance was a concert celebrating the Apollo 11 moon landings in New York City's Central Park. But by then, Coxe's oscillator monster was an anachronism. Moog and EMS were trading.", "Within a few years, you could choose from several decent synths for the price of a Telecaster. This put paid to what was—with hindsight—the first age of electronic music. Tape editing and oscillators passed out of mainstream practice, in both serious and popular music. Silver Apples split in 1970. When Coxe reformed the band decades later he had a more sensible rig, using contemporary technology, with one or two test oscillators for old times' sake.", 'These days, test oscillators are rarely used musically, and chances are if you hear a retro manipulated sine wave that sounds like it could have come from an oscillator, it\'s actually a hardware or software synth. But Nicolas Bernier keeps the flame burning with The Ensemble d\'oscillateurs (The Oscillator Ensemble). Inspired by the likes of Oliveros and Stockhausen, the 10-piece group performs entirely on vintage post-war oscillators. Speaking to Synthtopia in 2018, he said: "With only the frequency and volume as musical parameter, we are exploring ways to compose and improvise with sine waves, and a bit of square waves—nothing else."', 'About the Author: Mark Brend is an author and a musician.

'https://reverb.com/marketplace?query=neve'], ['If there really is such a phenomenon as having Golden Ears, then surely Rupert Neve, who died at the age of 94 in February this year, deserves the accolade. Born in the English town of Newton Abbot in Devon in 1926, he started life at a time when the concept of realistic sound reproduction was next to meaningless, but he ended it in a world of supreme audio quality, a fair amount of which he was directly responsible for.', "Rupert is best known for his recording consoles, which became a benchmark for sound quality from the '60s onward, but his achievements stretched beyond mixers and also beyond the original eponymous company he founded. Most of his various businesses bore his name in one form or another. Along the way, he designed microphones, loudspeakers, a transducer for electro-acoustic guitars, purist hi-fi equipment, and some of the most revered equalizers, compressors, microphone preamps, and mixing consoles ever made.", "He cut his teeth in his early teens designing amplifiers and radios, and then served in the British Army in World War II working on communication equipment. Back in civilian life in the early '50s, Rupert built an early and successful mobile studio, where he would record live events onto disc. Later, he established a hi-fi loudspeaker company, and it was through this that he attracted the attention of an Irish composer, Desmond Leslie, for whom he built his first mixing desk.", 'Spurred by the success, he created the Rupert Neve Company in 1961 to pursue what was then a growing market for improved recording consoles. Rupert was an early advocate of transistors, and soon he found buyers who appreciated the intense musicality, warmth, and clarity that was eventually to make the Neve 50- and 80-Series consoles the standard in British recording studios.', "His first customer was Philips Records, for which he initially built an equalizer, then an entire console, helping establish a reputation that soon began to spread to the US and other countries. Later, it was a Neve 8028 that found a home in LA's Sound City and was responsible for some of the biggest-selling rock albums of all time by artists including Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, and Nirvana.", 'Neve had set an audio standard which is still current today, as demonstrated by the number of emulations and plugins designed to simulate "the Neve sound." The microphone preamp, equalizer, and processing modules in those early Neve consoles, such as the 1073 and 1081, became so sought-after (and the resulting prices so high) that myriad boutique manufacturers have sprang up to offer clones and copies. Brent Averill and BAE, Dan Alexander Audio, Heritage Audio, and many, many others have offered both reverent and not-so-reverent versions.', 'Though hailing from the analogue era, Neve was the first in the world to produce a moving-fader mixer, the Necam system, quickly adopted by Beatles producer George Martin in 1977 for his recently opened Air London recording studio. With fully digital recording on the horizon, Necam consoles had the ability to store and recall fader movements, resulting in a computer-assisted mixer but without the loss of the analogue quality sound for which Neve had become famous.', "Just prior to the Necam launch, in 1975, Rupert needed capital so the business could expand, and he sold Neve Electronics to a larger UK company, which in 1985 went on to sell the business to Siemens. Neve himself left the firm in '75. Siemens, meanwhile, later sold Neve Electronics to yet another UK manufacturer, AMS (Advanced Music Systems), creating AMS Neve, which remains in business today.", 'In the meantime, Rupert and his wife Evelyn had gone on to form ARN (the initials come from his full name, Arthur Rupert Neve). Working originally under a non-compete agreement, ARN\'s purpose at first was to design soundsystems for what were described as "difficult buildings" (notably churches, cathedrals and the like). However, in 1989, ARN joined forces with another British company, Amek Systems, to offer both mixing consoles and outboard equipment.', "ARN also founded the original Focusrite company, in 1985, making outboard gear and signal processors, but it survived only until 1989, when it was liquidated. One notable success in the firm's short existence, however, came when George Martin hired it to expand the original Neve console at his famous Air Monserrat studio.", "The Focusrite we know today, meanwhile, came into being when the original company's name and assets were purchased in 1989 by Phil Dudderidge, the co-founder of Soundcraft. Rupert Neve had no connection with the re-formed Focusrite. It was also while he was running ARN that Rupert worked on Taylor Guitars' much-praised ES acoustic pickup system and pre-amplifier, marking his apparent sole foray into the musical instrument market.", 'In 1994, Rupert and Evelyn, who had been a partner in all Rupert\'s ventures, moved to Wimberley, Texas. Rupert eventually took US citizenship in 2002. In 2005, he began yet another venture, Rupert Neve Designs, offering microphone preamps and outboard gear including equalizers and compressors, grouped into the Portico, Portico II, and Shelford lines. In this way, the famous "Neve sound" made its way into home and project studios, then (and now) a rapidly growing market.', "Rupert's reputation in that era was further advanced when he worked with sE Electronics and designed the acclaimed Rupert Neve Signature Series microphones, launched in 2008.", "Four years later, the company began producing equipment in the 500 series form factor, and in 2018 Rupert released his first digital design, the RMP-D8 Dante-networked multi-channel microphone preamp. In 2011, Yamaha had launched for its Steinberg platform the first Rupert Neve Designs plugins, approved by Rupert, and these have also been integrated into Yamaha's CL Series and Rivage PM10 digital consoles.", "The final products from Rupert Neve's own hand appeared in 2019 with the launch of Fidelice, a new range comprising a headphone amplifier, phono pre-amplifier, and digital-to-analogue converter for the hi-fi market. Meanwhile, Rupert Neve Designs had assembled a team of electronics engineers and designers around Rupert, and the company continues to operate from Texas, where Rupert and Evelyn had lived and worked for 27 years.", "Unlike many pioneers, Rupert Neve's achievements were noticed and celebrated by his peers. In 1989, he was inducted into the TEC (Technical Excellence and Creativity) Hall of Fame, and in 1997 he received a Technical Grammy Award for lifetime accomplishment. He won an Audio Engineering Society Fellowship Award in 2006, 16 TEC Awards for Rupert Neve Designs products, and in 1999 Studio Sound magazine named him Audio Person of the Century.", 'Rupert was married to Evelyn for nearly 70 years. The couple had five children, nine grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren. Beyond the technical audio press, Rupert\'s prominence in the development of modern recording and sound technology resulted in obituaries in newspapers around the world, including The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian, Variety, and The New York Times, which quoted Dave Grohl: "What you get when you record on a Neve desk is this really big, warm representation of whatever comes into it."', 'About the Author: Gary Cooper is a journalist working in the musical instrument and pro audio fields.

It’s a term often used in the flower and plant world, but it can be used just as much, if not more, in the music world.', "There was once a day when musical genres rarely, if ever, mixed. Those days are long gone. Take rock 'n’ roll, for example. When it started back in the mid-'50s, rock 'n’ roll was a cross-pollination of many diverse musical styles: blues, swing, rhythm and blues, country—even gospel. And around the same time, cross-pollination in the musical instrument manufacturing world took place at the Gretsch factory in Brooklyn, New York.", 'Even though the block-long Gretsch Building was a huge 10-story structure, the Fred Gretsch Manufacturing Company only needed to occupy one-and-a-half floors in the 1950s. The rest of the building was rented out to other businesses, creating a regular cash flow for the successful Gretsch family real estate business.', 'It was on the seventh floor, where Gretsch guitars and drums were manufactured, that Jimmie Webster, Gretsch’s chief guitar designer and brand ambassador, saw an ingenious way to distance the look and glitz of Gretsch guitars from their conservative-looking competition.', 'After watching Fender and Gibson grab an early lead in the new solidbody electric guitar war, Gretsch answered in the fall of 1953 with the introduction of the Duo Jet. "Duo" for its two single-coil DeArmond Dynasonic pickups and "Jet" to reflect the latest in space-age technology.', 'With its heavily chambered mahogany body and glued-on top, the 13.5-inch single-cutaway Duo Jet looked like a solidbody but was more of a semi-solidbody guitar in reality.', 'Legend has it that Webster, walking through the drum department at the Gretsch factory one afternoon, saw a worker gluing sparkly drum material onto a wooden drum shell and asked if the same could be done to a solid body guitar top. They tried it, it looked cool, and the early Duo Jets featured a piece of glossy Jet Black Nitron drum finish glued onto its slightly arched top.', 'But not all Jets in that debut batch of 100 made in late 1953 were black. At least one left the factory with a silver sparkle finish.', 'During the writing of this article, Gretsch guitar authority Ed Ball shared the news with me that the earliest documented Silver Jet—the first known example from 1953—had surfaced. Ball was kind enough to put me in touch with its owner, Nathan Fasold, of Black Book Guitars in Portland, Oregon.', 'Fasold shared that he was contacted by the granddaughter of the owner a few years ago and was floored by its condition and originality. As you can tell from the photographs, it is quite a time capsule. This is the first time Fasold has shared the photographs of his ultra-rare Silver Jet, which is not for sale but is part of the Black Book Collection and archives.', 'Like other ’53 Jets, Fasold’s Silver Jet has the Gretsch "script logo" on the headstock, a fixed Melita bridge, a plain white wedge-style pickguard, and a missing block inlay on the first fret. The paper label, located inside the electronics access cavity, confirms that its serial number is from the debut ’53 batch.', 'It has also been stamped as a 6128 Duo Jet model instead of a Silver Jet’s 6129 model number. This was common in those early batches as it appears Gretsch hadn’t gotten around to ordering the 6129 rubber stamp yet.', 'A 1954 price sheet listed the Silver Jet for $230. A year later, the price had increased to $255 and the 1955 Gretsch catalog described their glistening guitar as having "unparalleled spotlight sparkle" and a flashing sparkle top. Truth in advertising for sure.', 'Although Gretsch offered additional drum sparkle color options—including green, red, blue, and gold—Webster decided to only offer the silver sparkle option on the new Jet.', 'When I asked Joe Carducci, retired Gretsch Product Marketing Specialist, if he knew why silver sparkle was the only color option offered on the early Jets, he said, "I’m not sure and we’ll probably never know the answer. My theory is that of all the sparkle colors available, silver best represented the times. The 1950s were all about chrome and the Space Age."', 'In 1958, the second generation of Silver Jets followed Gretsch’s switch from single-coil Dynasonics to humbucking Filter’Tron pickups.', 'Also new were the Space Control Bridge, a three-position tone-selector switch, and Neo-Classic thumbnail position markers on the ebony fingerboard.', 'Following Gibson’s double-cutaway styling lead, Gretsch’s Jet lineup changed from a single-cutaway to double-cutaways in 1961.', 'A year later, Jets featured a Burns Vibrato Unit and also introduced more sparkly drum finish color options including Gold, Champagne, Tangerine, and Burgundy. Few of these new colors were produced and are very rare today.', 'By 1964 with sales slumping, the Silver Jet disappeared from the Jet lineup. It would be another 25 years before it would return, but it was worth the wait.', "For most of the 1980s, no Gretsch guitars were produced. With little buyer interest in hollow-bodies and sales tanking, the Baldwin Company (who had purchased Gretsch in 1967) ceased guitar production in the early '80s.", 'When Fred W. Gretsch—the great-grandson of Gretsch founder, Friedrich Gretsch, and his wife and business partner, Dinah—bought the family business from Baldwin in 1984, their first priority was resuscitating the existing Gretsch drum business. Starting basically from scratch, it would take five years before a new generation of glistening (and sparkly) Gretsch guitars would be available.', "In the fall of 1989, nine new Gretsch electrics from their golden era of the '50s and '60s were unveiled, including the 25-year return of the G6129 Silver Jet. Priced at $1,400, this new version wasn’t an exact replica of a late-'50s Silver Jet (it had a wider Baldwin-era headstock with horseshoe inlay and an Adjusto-Matic bridge for example), but it was close enough for Gretsch fans.", "Players have described the Filter’Tron pickups from this era and being less twangy with more of a grittier growl. And the mahogany bodies were less chambered, making them heavier than the original '50s version and Jets being manufactured today. In other words, they had their own distinctive sound and vibe.", 'The next big chapter in the Silver Jet saga—as well as Gretsch guitars in general—occurred in 2002 when Gretsch announced it was forming an alliance with FMIC, who would be responsible for the manufacturing and worldwide distribution of Gretsch guitars. Fender wanted to take the current lineup of Gretsch guitars to the next level and had the resources to do it.', 'Mike Lewis, currently VP of Product Development at Fender’s Custom Shop, became the Product Manager of Gretsch guitars in 2002. Lewis shared that he started the refinement process by playing both current Gretsch guitars and vintage Gretsches at his band’s gigs and listening for the differences. He also followed Gretsch online forums to read what players were saying about the current Gretsch lineup.', '"We had the resources to discover the recipe," said Lewis. "The way they were made, the type of materials, pickups, construction methods, the thickness of the tops, and the thickness of the backs and sides. Over the course of six months or so of taking on the Gretsch product line, I think we changed virtually every spec on every model just to try to dial it in. And I think we did a pretty good job. They were all met with good reviews and people seemed to like them."', 'There’s no denying that Lewis and the Fender team were successful in discovering the right recipe. The Silver Jets produced since 2003 more accurately capture the mojo, look, feel, and tone of the classic Jets of the 1950s.', "Although the more traditional-looking black and chrome Duo Jet had gotten the most Jet family notoriety in the 1950s and '60s (thanks to Hank Garland, Cliff Gallup, and George Harrison), that changed in the late-'70s when Billy Zoom strapped on a sparkly ’55 Silver Jet and made the world take notice of his LA-based punk band, X. (To honor the sparkly Jet’s first superstar, the Gretsch Custom Shop issued a limited-run Billy Zoom Tribute Silver Jet based on his iconic vintage ’55 guitar in 2008.)", 'Sparkly Jets were also an integral part of the raucous Seattle grunge sound, thanks to the late Chris Cornell of Soundgarden. By the 1990s, Gretsch had expanded their color options to include Gold Sparkle, and Cornell can be seen playing one in the band’s famous "Black Hole Sun" video in 1994.', 'Silver Jets and many color variations of "Sparkle Jets" have been offered for more than 30 consecutive years since being relaunched in 1989. Currently, Gretsch offers a Bigsby-equipped Players Edition Jet available with a Silver Sparkle or Red Sparkle top.', "In 2021, Gretsch paid homage to Chris Cornell and the unique sound of their 1989 Jets that rocked the grunge movement by introducing a new Vintage Select Sparkle Jet Series. Available in Silver or Gold Sparkle, these faithful 1989 recreations feature a correct less-chambered mahogany body, TV Jones pickups, an Adjusto-Matic bridge, and even the correct larger late-'80s headstock with horseshoe inlay.", 'For more than 65 years, players have been drawn to Gretsch guitars because of their great looks as well as "That Great Gretsch Sound." No other guitar manufacturer would’ve dared, or even dreamed of offering a drum sparkle finish on a guitar back in 1954. As Joe Carducci shared, "Well, a Silver Jet is not for everybody. It makes a really bold statement. It can be very pretentious. But in the same breath, it’s also glorious."', 'You’ve got to tip your hat to the creative, bold imagination of Jimmie Webster, as well as to his boss, Fred Gretsch, Jr. They wanted their new electric guitars to stand out and get noticed in music stores, onstage, on TV, and in movies. And to sound as great as they looked. With the Gretsch Silver Jet and Sparkle Jet series, they succeeded on all fronts.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

While not technically still in production today, it’s not too far removed from the current Gibson Les Paul Junior Tribute DC Bass and the SG Standard Bass. Until recently, Epiphone also made its own version of the EB-0.', 'The EB-0 and its close relative, the EB-3, are often subject to some confusion, possibly due to the change in design, and their similarity to certain guitar shapes, so we’ll look to set things straight here.', 'Whilst the Gibson EB-0 saw many different variations over the years, its distinguishing features include: a single humbucking pickup placed close to the neck, tone and volume knobs, a mahogany body and neck, and a rosewood fingerboard. The EB-0 also has a short scale—30.5 inches (Gibson also introduced a long scale version in 1970, the EB-0L).', "The late '50s/early '60s was an exciting time for music with lots of musicians forming bands—most of these bands needed a bass player, so many guitarists of the time transitioned from guitar to bass out of necessity (Paul McCartney being a prime example). The 30.5-inch scale seen on basses like the EB-0 feels a little more familiar to guitarists, so proved popular.", 'When it was first introduced in 1959, the EB-0 had the same body shape as the Gibson Les Paul Doublecut Junior and had banjo-style tuners placed on the back of the headstock. In 1961, Gibson changed the body shape to be more like that of an SG, and that’s the model that we’re more used to seeing.', "The double-cutaway EB-0 models of '59-'61 are quite rare, with only approximately 500 being made in total. This change in body shape in ’61 coincides with Gibson’s general shift away from the singlecut Les Paul toward what we’d now consider to be an SG. It’s worth noting that whilst the bass resembled popular Gibson guitars, the EB-0 was never referred to as a Les Paul or SG bass.", "Like with many Gibsons from the late-'50s/early-'60s, those DC Junior-style basses have some serious mojo about them.", 'The combination of the neck profile—chunky, but not too thick—and a short scale makes them an absolute dream to play (speaking primarily as a guitar player), and those Sidewinder pickups are bursting with character. Granted, they’re not for every application, but in the context of a three-piece rock band for example, there’s nothing else that I’d choose over an EB-0.', 'The sound of these basses tends to be pretty dark and thick; it’s not as defined as other basses out there. So much so, in fact, that the EB pickups were sometimes referred to as "mudbuckers."', 'They’re very bassy, without a great deal of middle and top-end, so if you’re after clarity and brightness, this probably isn’t the bass for you.However, by keeping your strings relatively fresh and dialling your amp in, you’ll find that you’ve got just the right amount of definition to your tone.', "The EB-0 works really well for the '60s British Invasion-style of music, providing a nice, thumpy, and rounded low-end for jangly guitars to sit really well on top of. I also love an EB-0 bass through an overdriven tube amp—this gives you the ultimate, huge rock bass tone.", 'If you want to go even further, stick one through a fuzz pedal—it’s not going to please everyone, but for some players, the sound is going to be exactly what they’re after. Gibson even made a version of these basses in 1965 with a Fuzztone circuit built in, the Gibson EB-0F. Throughout all of its early iterations, when compared to the Fender bass models at the time, the EB-0 provided something completely different.', 'The Gibson EB-3 was brought into production in 1961, along with the introduction of the SG-style body. It’s pretty much the same as an EB-0, with the addition of a mini humbucker in the bridge position (along with the accompanying volume and tone knobs), plus a rotary tone knob (similar to a Varitone).', "The EB-3 proved to be more popular, most likely due to its versatility, and was the bass of choice for loads of classic rock players. Through the '60s and '70s and all the way up to today, the EB-3—and, more recently, the SG Standard Bass—continued the legacy that the EB-0 started.", 'Whilst more players opted for the EB-3, players such as Dennis Dunaway (Alice Cooper’s original bassist) played an EB-0. Glen Matlock also used one in the early days of the Sex Pistols, though more recently, Johnny Marr of The Smiths has been seen playing Glen’s old EB-0.', 'Jethro Tull bassist Glenn Cornick occasionally used one alongside his EB-3—as did Jack Bruce of Cream. Bernie Calvert of The Hollies also had a 1959 Gibson EB-0, though he didn’t use it live.', 'EB-3 players include Andy Fraser of Free, Bob Paisley with Ozzy Osbourne, and Mike Watt. Also, Billy Sheehan took the pickup out of an EB-0 and put it in his prize P-Bass (lovingly referred to as "The Wife")—this pickup combination is very similar to what can be seen on his current signature Yamaha Attitude basses.', 'As previously mentioned, Epiphone made a great version of the EB-0 up until very recently. It had the short scale, single humbucker, SG-esque body shape, and came in at a really good price. There are still quite a few floating around the used market, so that’s definitely worth checking out if you want a more budget-friendly version.', "The Gibson Les Paul DC Tribute is a really cool, modern take on those '59-'61 models. It features the more rounded double-cut body shape and a single humbucker—it’s not quite as close to the neck as the originals, so isn’t quite as thick in terms of tone, but it’s still nice and thumpy.", 'It’s also got a coil split option, so you can get single coil-style tones too, making it pretty versatile. Then there’s the Gibson SG Standard Bass, which is probably closer in spec to an EB-3.', 'The Gibson EB-0, when it was released in 1959, provided the market with something completely different. It was Gibson’s first solid-body bass guitar and gave players a different type of sound, especially when compared to something like a P-Bass. It’s also worth noting that the Fender Jazz was released the year after, in 1960, which was even further away from the EB-0 in terms of tone.', 'The EB-0 isn’t super bright, it doesn’t sound particularly defined, but it is unique. It sounds huge and provides an incredibly thick low-end, plus the short scale makes it quite easy to play—particularly for those transitioning from guitar to bass. It’s the perfect choice for bassists that need to fill a wide sonic space, and it gives one of the best driven bass sounds out there.', "Those early '59-'61 models also capture that mysterious Burst-era magic. It’s difficult to put your finger on, but out of the hundreds of basses I’ve played, a ’59 EB-0 is absolutely the best bass guitar I’ve been fortunate enough to lay my hands on.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Top of the list for many musicians making ambient (as well as other genres, like house) was Roland’s Juno-106.', 'A six-voice polysynth released in 1984, the Juno-106 was perfect for making pads and other sounds favored by ambient producers. Though it only had one oscillator, it sounded bigger than its specs would indicate. Its famous two-speed chorus was a big contributor to this. The 106 was also incredibly easy to program and almost impossible to make sound bad. And, as it would be another ten or 15 years before its voice chips would start to fail, it was still an affordable and largely trouble-free investment.', 'Of course, there were plenty of other polys appearing on ambient and IDM records in the ‘90s, such as Roland’s Jupiter-6 and offerings from Sequential Circuits (like the Prophet 5) and Oberheim (like the OB-8), but you’d be hard-pressed to find a more dance music-oriented poly than the Juno-106.', 'It’s no secret that dance music producers love Roland. The Japanese company’s cast-off gear, like the TR-808 and TB-303, helped birth numerous genres, from hip-hop to acid house and beyond. The SH-101 was another such piece of must-have Roland finery.', 'Released in 1982, the SH-101 seemed like just another in a long line of SH-named Roland monosynths. There was something different about this one, though. Was it the beefy sub-oscillator? The squelchy filter? The simple design? All of the above? Whatever the reason, it became incredibly popular with electronic music producers in the ‘90s (and indeed remains so today). It could fake a 303 (check out 808 State’s use of it on their seminal Newbuild album) and, of course, provide standard bass and lead sounds.', "If climbing prices have turned you off, check out Yamaha’s underrated CS-5 from 1978. Richard James—a.k.a. the Aphex Twin—scratched the liner notes of his genre-defining Selected Ambient Works Volume II album into the bottom of one, so it's safe to assume it was used on that album. It has a unique sound with a particularly smooth filter, which is perfect for ambient music.", 'One of the reasons that analog was so derided in the ‘90s was the rise of sample-based synthesis. Machines like Korg’s M1 actually sounded like the instrument they were supposed to be recreating, with its piano and organ sounds getting particularly rinsed in dance music. For the average ambient musician, however, the M1 and its successor, the Wavestation were too expensive. That made Kawai’s K1 a popular alternative.', 'Released in 1988, the K1’s specs were too lo-fi for most serious musicians (8-bit samples! The shame!) but it was an affordable way to add realistic, sample-based sounds to a production. Its choral patch “Aah” was ubiquitous in late-‘80s and ‘90s ambient and New Age music. The landmark 76:14 album by Global Communication prominently features the K1. It still sounds great today—the low bit rate gives it real character. It’s also still very affordable. Snap one up before the PCM revival hits full bore.', 'The ‘90s were the glory days of the hardware sampler. Before computers stole their thunder and made them obsolete, a good sampler (or 10) was all a producer needed to make viable electronic music. Ambient was no exception. While many opted for one of the many entries in Akai’s S-series of hardware samplers—the S950 and S3000, especially—there was another machine that was particularly beloved by ambient and IDM producers.', 'Until the‘80s, Casio were mostly known to musicians as makers of consumer-grade keyboards. That changed with the low-cost CZ line. The first, the CZ-101, sold truckloads, and convinced Casio to try their luck at more pro-level instruments. They followed it with the FZ-1 in 1987, a full-on professional sampler with an eight-stage envelope and additive synthesizer component.', 'However, it was its filter—with its tell-tale resonant signature—that made it a firm favorite of electronic musicians of the time. It was used by Global Communication, LFO (it’s the defining sound of Frequencies, their debut album) and Richard James, who, working under the Polygon Window moniker, used it on his Surfing On Sine Ways album. Check out the more modern "fz pseudotimestretch+e+3 [138.85]" track to hear him pushing the FZ-1 envelope to its limit.', 'Just as analog was out by the ‘90s, FM was also coming to be seen as a little old hat. Sample synthesis and ROMplers were clearly the way of the future (or so ‘90s synthesists thought). Because of their affordability then, it wasn’t uncommon to find the occasional FM synth in the ‘90s electronic music producer’s arsenal. Yamaha’s DX100 continued to be popular with techno producers, while the TX81Z made a great source for strings, pads and keys.', 'Originally released in 1987, the TX81Z was a four-operator FM synth and the first to feature oscillator waves beyond basic sine waves. This expanded its range of possible sounds, making it more than just another 4-op budget synth like the DX21. It was used by Future Sound Of London and Astral Projection, as well as Global Communication, who tapped it for Rhodes-type keys on their song, "Obselon Minus." Yamaha’s rackmount FM machine is most famous for its bass patch, "Lately Bass," and this was also also employed by Global Communication (albeit in edited form) on "7:39."', 'The TX81Z is still a great bargain. It also doesn’t sound like your typical DX7-style FM. It’s a bit warmer and darker, perfect for ‘90s-style ambient.', 'Affordable hardware effects were few and far between in the 1990s. Most bedroom producers couldn’t afford fancy reverb units by companies like Lexicon. Instead, they largely relied on Alesis, whose low-cost effects made digital reverbs available to the little guy. One of the more popular units was the QuadraVerb.', 'Hitting the market in 1989, the 1U rackmount Quadraverb combined reverb, delay, EQ, and pitch effects into one box. The 16-bit effects unit was particularly prized for its huge chorus reverb—think Valhalla plugins in a box. It was instant ambient and was put to use on many a famous recording in the ‘90s.', 'Mark Pritchard of Global Communication even sang its praises on a forum post, saying, "The signature reverb sound (of the album 76:14) was an Alesis Quadraverb... It was noisy and detuney." Pritchard also identified the Aphex Twin as a user. "Richard Aphex used one as well, coincidentally. I knew because I could hear it on his stuff. He was using DX100 a lot into the Quadraverb.” As he mentions, it was (and is) noisy but that’s part of its old-school charm.', 'Other hardware effects from the era worth a look are the Boss SE-50 and SE-70, Ensoniq DP/4, and Zoom Studio 1201, which also has a built-in vocoder.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

The MPC 60 was that rare piece of sophisticated digital technology that could be used as an intuitive tool for musical expression.', 'Akai brought Roger Linn on board in 1986 to develop the template that would pervade the massively popular hardware MPC line: 16 touch pads, simple sampling, and a powerful sequencer with MIDI integration.', 'This was not Roger Linn’s first sampling rodeo. In 1979 he launched his career designing the LM-1 Drum Computer, the first ever drum machine using digital samples of drum sounds, made immortal as a standby on Prince’s records in the 1980s. Next came his LinnDrum, heard on dozens of Top 40 hits from the same decade.', 'Akai intended to use Linn’s expertise to relay the success of its rackmount sampler series into an all-in-one production studio. What neither entity realized was that the MPC 60’s long sampling time and implementation of Roger Linn’s signature swing programming would revolutionize electronic music, first and foremost hip-hop.', 'Once the MPC 60 became popular in the electronic production sphere, the company started regularly releasing new models with incremental updates. But the story of the MPC’s influence on music is one of its most influential models hitting the market at just the right time.', 'The MPC 60 was introduced in 1988, competing with the main sampler used during the golden age of hip-hop, the E-mu SP-1200. While the SP-1200 would go on to be used throughout the ‘90s, the MPC had it beat on day one with its significantly longer sampling time and higher audio resolution, at 13.1 seconds of total sampling time versus the SP-1200’s 2.5 seconds and 40kHz audio rate versus the SP-1200’s 27.5 kHz.', 'The MPC 60 was designed as playable drum machine, with its innovative grid of 16 square pads that could be used to program the machine’s sequencer. This grid was adapted from the external controller for the never-produced MidiStudio.', 'Linn was responsible not just for that interface, but for the design of the entire MPC operating system. Along with his development team in California, Linn developed the software that would make the MPC’s operation so intuitive and set the blueprint for MPC functionality across all generations.', 'The hands-on aspect and the capacity for recording and manipulating sounds directly on the machine meant that the MPC 60 had a lot more flexibility than conventional step-based drum machines like the Roland TR-808.', 'Linn and Akai gave the MPC 60 MIDI capabilities to sync external sequencers and control synths with its own internal sequencer. With four MIDI outputs and a 99-track sequencer capable of programming internal sounds and external ones, the MPC 60 could act as the brain for an entire studio of gear.', 'Over email, Linn related that the MPC 60’s innovation of creating a MIDI sequencer that could be programmed on the fly was simply an elaboration on his early drum machine designs, which allowed for live loop recording with quantization.', '“At the time,” he recounts, “I intended it for any type of rhythmic music, but I had no idea it would resonate so strongly with the emerging hip-hop community, which was a very pleasant surprise.”', 'The MPC 60 was popular early on, but it would also sustain in hip-hop for years to come. This model was used, for instance, on Warren G’s “Regulate” in 1995, DJ Shadow’s sampling masterpiece Endtroducing in 1996, and continued to be used by DJ Premier into the 2000s.', 'Possibly the most revered of all beatmakers, J Dilla was known to have worked with MPC 60 and MPC 60MKII before settling into Akai’s next model, the MPC 3000. Dilla would remain loyal to the 3000 throughout his career, even as he integrated Pro Tools into his workflow.', 'The MPC 3000 upgraded sampling resolution to 16 bits and sampling time was increased to 22 seconds, expandable to three minutes. With more notes available per sequence, the 3000 became even more prevalent as the brain of a studio. Dr. Dre liked the MPC 3000 so much that it’s rumored he used as many as five of them on The Chronic and 2001.', 'On the heels of the MPC 3000, Roger Linn stepped away from Akai. The company’s first entry in the MPC line without Linn was the MPC 2000, debuting in 1997. The confusing step back from MPC 3000 to MPC 2000 is due to Akai’s incorporation of features from its s2000 rackmount sampler.', 'Akai overhauled the MPC operating system in an attempt to avoid paying Linn royalties for his hardware and software design. This meant that the 2000 lacked the Roger Linn’s signature swing program. The 2000 also only offered two MIDI outputs. Many considered this machine underwhelming, but the MPC 2000 still found love from Kanye West’s on his early productions.', 'Two years later, Akai would revise the MPC 2000 with its MPC 2000XL, perhaps the most popular sampler that company ever made. A huge step up from its predecessor, the 2000XL builds on the 3000’s status as a studio in a box, with an output board expandable to eight MIDI outs and internal effects unit. A powerful software upgrade included features like file folder management and chromatic sample assignment.', 'This machine quickly gained the favor of hip-hop legends such as MF DOOM and Pete Rock and went on to inspire a generation of beatmakers such as Marco Polo and RJD2. Similar to the MPC 3000, the 2000XL often finds itself as the centerpiece of a diverse array of dance producer’s studio, from Detroit techno producer Theo Parrish to footwork innovators DJ Rashad and Traxman to underground house and disco sensations, Bicep.', 'The capabilities of the 60, 3000, and 2000XL would be combined into a single machine in 2004, the MPC4000. With high resolution 24-bit sampling at 96 kHz and 512 MB of memory, this became the weapon of choice for producer Madlib and acid jazz DJ Mark Farina.', 'DAWs started to take over music production during the 2000s, kicking off a game of king of the hill that would see the MPC starting to lose its foothold as the dominant all-in-one studio. As hardware starting losing out to software, Akai sensed a need to make its MPCs cheaper and better integrated with computers.', 'This lead to the release of the portable MPC 1000 in 2003 and its premium sister machine the MPC 2500 in 2007. Both of these models featured USB connectivity and use same compact flash cards as digital cameras for storage. These machine’s portability and flexibility made them the more popular of the 2000s MPC models.', 'These are also the machines that can host the alternate operating system, JJOS. Designed by a former Akai engineer going under the moniker Japanese Jenius, JJOS offers a number of improvements to the MPC 1000 and MPC 2500. The operating system imparts software features from the 2000XL while also making the MPC more of a playable instrument with expanded melodic and sequencing functionalities.', 'JJOS was made possible by the Internet age on two counts. First, JJOS’s success is entirely indebted to the internet, with Japanese Jenius selling his operating system from a very web 1.0 website. The other count is that these MPCs had the USB connectivity which allows for easy transfer of large files and installation.', 'Later on, this would be one of the first models to support JJOS, the third party, and arguably superior operating system for a small band of MPC units. Notable beat makers who have relied on this machine have included Nujabes, Just Blaze, and Mike Shinoda from Linkin Park.', 'In 2012, Akai pivoted and stripped the MPC of its standalone status with the MPC Renaissance. This product, and the subsequent Touch and Studio models, relied on Akai’s MPC software to function. The shift from all-in-one studio to, effectively, a MIDI controller for a proprietary MPC-branded DAW, these machines lost a lot of the appeal of the classic MPC run.', 'Instead of standing alone as the preeminent hardware sampler, the MPC and its complementary software entered the ring facing the formidable Native Instruments Maschine and Ableton Live’s soon-to-come Push controller.', "Five years after that abrupt shift, Akai returned to the standalone paradigm, announcing the portable MPC Live and the studio-ready MPC X at 2017's NAMM. Both of these easily integrated with Akai’s proprietary MPC software but in no way rely on the DAW.", "Today, the MPC Live II and the MPC One continue this return-to-form for the legendary line. And if you do wish to control your DAW workflow with an MPC interface and don't care for standalone devices, the MPD pad controllers are inexpensive options in the beloved MPC style.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

the combination becomes iconic: Bob Marley and his Les Paul Special, Mary Kaye and her Blonde Stratocaster, or Thundercat and his 6-String Ibanez Bass. Often, brands from Fender to Ludwig will work with artists or artists' estates to turn these instantly identifiable instruments into signature models.", "This signature gear honors a musician's artistry, gives fans a chance to own an instrument with the artist's own specs or modifications, and can even become so popular that it grows beyond the association with any one player and becomes part of the musical instruments lexicon. For example, say, the Gibson Les Paul.", "Many influential women in music have collaborated on signature models, especially in recent years, like Ibanez's Yvette Young YY10, Blackstar's Carmen Vanderberg CV30, Ernie Ball Music Man's St. Vincent Signature, and Fender's H.E.R. Stratocaster and Billie Eilish Ukulele.", "But there are many other influential women from music's past and present who have had close associations with particular instruments but so far have not received the signature model treatment. So we're thinking of some of our favorites, and imagining the signature models that could be.", '', "Think of a three-pickup SG Custom and there's a good chance you're picturing it in Rosetta Tharpe's hands. While she played numerous guitars throughout her career, pictures and videos of her early-'60s performances have created a strong bond between the godmother of rock 'n' roll and the devil-horned rock machine. A period-correct SG Custom with the sideways Vibrola and gold hardware in that regal white finish? That would be a great signature guitar.", '', 'Tina Weymouth of Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club could truly have several signature models: the racing stripe Fender Mustang Bass, Musicmaster Bass, or others in her arsenal. But the Hofner 500/2 Club Bass—which she first bought in 1977, used on many Talking Heads records, and played during some of the funkiest moments of the Stop Making Sense concert doc—is perhaps the top contender. Maybe Hofner could even include a strip of gaffers tape as case candy.', '', 'Wendy Carlos\' first Moog system was custom-built, "a gorgeous walnut cabinet with many additional adjunct devices and wiring," she later wrote. Carlos used this early Moog to create Switched-On Bach, the overnight sensation that propelled synthesizers—and Moog synths in particular—into the public eye. While it would be unwieldy to recreate Carlos\' entire system from that time, maybe a new walnut-encased Minimoog reissue could come with some Carlos-inspired appointments, or a book of patches in the style of Carlos\' classic works. In the same way Moog has recently released the Claravox theremin for Clara Rockmore, a Minimoog (or, truly, any Moog) for Carlos could honor one of the primary pioneers of electronic music.', '', "12 drums, 13 drums, 17 drums—Viola Smith had a penchant for multi-shell setups. The jazz drummer, who rose to fame in the 1930s with her swinging big band and passed away in 2020 at the age of 107, was the first female drumming star. As a longtime WFL and Ludwig artist, she stood out in a roster otherwise full of men. And with her trademark setup of 16-inch floor toms decidedly not on the floor, she was bound to stand out on any stage. While there's not much of a market for super-sized drum kits these days, a pair of 16-inch floor toms—with expandable stands—would make a fitting tribute.", '', "Back in 2016, Jlin selected percussion sounds for Native Instruments' Komplete Sketches series. Her ear for Cuban timbales, West African djembes, and other hits created an evocative collection that could be used in NI's software suite. The producer's imaginative sonics and elastic rhythms have resulted in a uniquely boundless discography, from footwork beats to her choreography score with Wayne McGregor. Which got us to thinking… Could Jlin and NI team up again, but this time with a full firmware takeover of the Maschine+, akin to Novation's Aphex Twin collaboration, the AFX Station?", '', 'No one besides Motown\'s James Jamerson has contributed more to how the electric bass is heard and played than Carol Kaye. The first-call session musician and "Wrecking Crew" member contributed basslines to an unbelievable amount of pop hits and film soundtracks. In the \'60s, on sessions for The Beach Boys, Ike & Tina Turner, Simon & Garfunkel, and more, the muted and picked tone she got on her Fender Precision Bass filled the country\'s radio airwaves. Known for using a piece of felt at the bridge and placing her own shim under the neck, her P-Bass wasn\'t far from stock. But collaborating on a signature model that feels exactly right for her would surely feel right in other player\'s hands too.', '', 'When Lianne La Havas was making her third, self-titled album, she gravitated toward a vintage Stratotone. She told Guitar.com, "I was immediately familiar with it when I bought it. It felt like it had been mine for a really long time, and I didn’t know that an instrument could feel like that." That feeling is all one can ask for when looking for an instrument, and her 1964 Harmony is just the type of vibey, vintage guitar you can still find for a steal. But recent years have seen a full relaunch of the Harmony brand, which is once again making new models of retro favorites like the Juno and the Stratotone-like Jupiter. A Lianne La Havas Signature Stratotone could re-introduce the guitar to a new generation of players.', '', 'Laura Jane Grace is a Rickenbacker superfan. But in a collection of mean-looking Ricks, one in particular is the meanest-looking of them all. She calls this Rickenbacker 370 "Darth Vader," and it\'s easy to see why. Unlike other 370s, which sport the standard white pickguard and chrome-topped knobs, hers has a blackguard and black knobs on a fully black finish. One last modification—a Mastery bridge in place of the stock Rickenbacker—offers tuning stability, even amid Against Me\'s punk assault. A production-run signature model of Darth Vader would be sick, and its sleek, mean look could appeal to any number of other punks and aggressive players.', '', 'The Martin D-28 is a classic acoustic, and in the hands of Joni Mitchell, it was a vessel for her rarefied songwriting and alternate tunings. The story behind her particular 1956 D-28 was that she received it as a gift from a Marine in 1966. When he was in Vietnam, it survived an explosion that ruined the rest of his belongings. Mitchell used the D-28 on all of her early records and later wondered to Acoustic Guitar if "the explosion did something to the modules in the wood" that bestowed its special sound. Unfortunately, the guitar was stolen in the \'70s, and, while she has replaced it, she said she\'s never found another that compares. Could Martin work with her to create a signature D-28 that would?', "While we've thought up these particular signature models above, there is really no end to worthy contenders. Just in the bass-playing world alone, Kim Gordon, Gail Ann Dorsey, Esperanza Spalding, Kim Deal, and Laura Lee could have killer signature basses. Could Sennheiser make a witchy Stevie Nicks 441? What next-level instruments could Holly Herndon or Björk create with a manufacturer willing to give them free reign?", "Earlier this month, we asked Reverb’s social media community what signature model they'd like to see, and we got too many great responses to list in full. They included: Bilinda Butcher's Mustang with the Jazzmaster tremolo, Gail Ann Dorsey's Jazz Bass, Meg White's red-and-white drum kit, Poison Ivy Rorschach's Gretsch 6120, Phoebe Bridgers' Danelectro, and Memphis Minnie's National.", "The possibilities are truly endless, and, if the responses we received on social media are any indication, there's a large desire to see more signature models for women artists put into production.", 'In January of 2020, Spotify sponsored a study conducted by USC Annenberg titled "Inclusion in the Recording Studio? Gender and Race/Ethnicity of Artists, Songwriters & Producers across 800 Popular Songs from 2012-2019." It found that though women in music are gaining ground, male artists outnumbered women 3.6 to 1. The ratio of male to female producers across 500 popular songs was 37 to 1. Averaging data from the length of the study, only 12.5% of songwriters were women.', 'With numbers this low, is it a surprise we don’t see more women’s signature models at our local music stores? What steps can we take to build a more diverse industry where well-deserved signature models aren’t just a dream but a reality? How can we contribute to an inclusive environment that leads to a future full of signature models like the ones above?', 'To start, youth music education organizations like Willie Mae Future Sounds, countless Girls Rock camps across the globe, Chicxs Rockerxs Southeast LA, the NVAK Foundation, and Women’s Audio Mission, are actively providing young women with the guidance they need to envision themselves in the roles needed to break the mold. With the help of grants from Reverb Gives, they’re also getting the gear they need to make music.', 'After conducting their own study in 2018, Fender found that over 45% of new guitar purchases were driven by women and are taking steps to introduce more women’s signature models than they ever have before. An encouraging stat as we look toward the future paired with thoughtful action to help ensure more women players feel represented in guitar.', 'Learning how you can help support organizations like these in your own community helps immensely. Mentorship, being vocal about who you’d like to see represented by the gear companies you love, and uplifting women artists not just in March, but always, goes a long way. Maybe, with your help, we’ll start seeing some of these ideas, or even your own, come to life.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

It makes sense that Dilla is so revered in music circles; with albums like the slick, soulful sound of Slum Village's Fantastic Vol. 2 or his dense, sample-chopping opus, Donuts, Dilla's music has inspired countless musicians and pushed hip-hop forward.", "Often, the discussion around Dilla's sound has focused primarily on his unique approach to production. Whether it is the loose, swinging feel that he achieved with his drum programming or his creative approach to chopping and flipping samples, much of our analysis and understanding of Dilla's sound and the rich catalog that he left behind has focused on how he created his beats. But how was the sound on those watershed J Dilla records achieved in the mixing and mastering stages?", "In order to gain some insight on how this post-production work impacted the sound of Dilla's records, we interviewed Todd Fairall, Bob Power, David Kennedy, and Dave Cooley, four veteran engineers who each worked with Dilla at a significant period in his musical development. They told us about the gear, techniques, and overall approach they used on those projects.", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'David Kennedy on mixing A Tribe Called Quest\'s The Love Movement: I have chills here talking about it now. Tip [Q-Tip, the A Tribe Called Quest rapper and producer] had all this stuff laid out already and he knew what he wanted to track. And we tracked maybe five or six songs, until this disc showed up. This disc was from Detroit, and Tip slipped it in quietly and pressed play and I lost my mind. I was like, "This is it. This is what I\'ve been searching for." I didn\'t know about J Dilla at that time.', 'We get down to mixing "Find a Way," which was like my favorite track, And he came to New York for that session, and this quiet, unassuming, small fellow sits at the back of the room. He smoked, I smoke. And he just sat there and vibed, and I mixed. We said nothing other than hello and goodbye for the whole day. If I turned around and asked him, "Is there anything you want to suggest?" He just looked at me and shook his head, "no," whatever. And that was it.', "Todd Fairall: When I first started working on Jay Dee's beats, I didn't even know who he was. It was just these beats that were coming into the studio and local guys were bringing them in and could tell there was a certain guy that was working on this. And then the first project that we're making those beats, I mean, the stuff is so identifiable.", 'MCA booked a session for The Roots and, when they came in, it was Questlove, Black Thought, and ELO The Cosmic Eye. We were working on "Dynamite" from Things Fall Apart. We were talking and I said to Questlove, "What brings you to Detroit?" And he goes, "Uh, Jay Dee." And I was like, "Who\'s Jay Dee?" And he looked at me with like, almost a look like it was so serious and almost like, "Are you an idiot?" Like, What kind of engineer am I working with? And he was like, "The future of hip-hop!" And those words were proved to be so true after that. And then Jay came in a couple of hours later, and I knew he was a producer when he walked in with an MPC under his arm and probably had a crate of records and a turntable.', 'Dave Cooley: I was already doing projects for Stones Throw Records and in the middle of mixing The Shining. That\'s when Eothen ["Egon"] Alapatt, the GM at Stones Throw at the time, let me know that there was a really great "mixtape" that wasn\'t really a mixtape that they wanted to rush out. J\'s health was already pretty bad at that point, but he had been working on finishing Donuts in the hospital. He was just so dedicated. Peanut Butter Wolf (the owner of Stones Throw) wanted to get it out immediately so we rushed it in one day.', 'I think it either came in on CD-ROM or as an audio CD. Pretty much already completely thought out and sequenced. He had that Amadeus-like ability to see the whole thing before it was done.', "Bob Power: Jay was a very quiet guy. So when he came in, unless he was working, even when he was working sometimes… he didn't take up a lot of space in the room.", 'David Kennedy: At the time I was just getting into digital editing and recording. I was using PCs at the time, Microsoft Windows PCs, and I had a program called Sound Forge. I did some post-mix production on one or two songs and basic sequencing of the album. I didn\'t want to touch—I didn\'t want to venture into—Tom Coyne\'s territory. He was a mastering engineer. From what I\'ve heard, he was like, "There\'s really not much more I need to do other than just balance levels."', 'We were at Sony studios and they asked me, "What do you want to work on?" So, well, I\'m a Neve fan from day one. So wherever you can find me a Neve, you know? And I said, "Well, we could track on the vintage Neve [8078] and maybe mix on the VR [a different Neve console with full recall capabilities] later on." And we ended up just tracking and mixing on the same console. There\'s history attached to all those boards. The room had in basic outboard gear and, um, usually, on the VR I\'d use what\'s on the board, you know? It had EQ, compressors. I didn\'t have to be patching in and out.', 'I was a bass lover—you couldn\'t put on too much bass. If you listen to my early mixes, you\'ll laugh—you\'ll die. It\'s just mud. I had to figure out how to make it really work. So, I really started to pay attention to how I balance out the sound. Now, the tone that you hear at the bottom end is because I drive… I saturate EQs. I saturate those tones. I saturate the bass, and I find that saturation, I only get from a Neve. I can\'t get it from an SSL. A lot of people swear by SSL because it\'s so punchy. And I say, "OK, but it doesn\'t have that warmth." To me, it\'s not musical. I was just hitting stuff, as hard as possible. People would come in and say, "Boy, David, you always smashed the hell out of drums!" I mean… not in compression, but you make them tear up speakers.', "Bob Power: Most of the stuff was mixed on SSL, because of automation and because of the sufficient sophistication of the automation system at that point on SSLs. It was usually either that or a Neve VR, which was Neve's answer to an SSL—a better sounding console, but I didn't know how to get around on it. There's certain sonic anomalies of an SSL G that are not very good. Now, a lot of people for those same reasons like it, you know? A lot of rock mixers really like a G because of certain tonal characteristics, but there wasn't a tremendous amount of headroom in the mix bus.", 'The low frequency content was not big and open and round. You really needed to work the hell out on the bottom to make it big and round. And because there wasn\'t a lot of headroom in the mix bus, that bottom could get messy very quickly. The other thing is that the high frequency on that console is not what I would call "sweet." You had to work real hard to make sure that the high end was not harsh.', 'Todd Fairall (on kick drums & sample processing for Fantastic Vol. 2): Yeah, all of that, the Slum Village stuff was already recorded to an MCI JH24 analog tape machine, and then it was mixed through an SSL. It was actually an E-series SSL with a bunch of G-series upgrades to it, some G-series EQs in it. As far as compressors for vocals and stuff like that, a lot of that was the DBX 160X compressor. And then he was real fond of this particular program [in the] SPX900 [Yamaha rack mount effects processor]. It\'s a multi-effects processor and the program on it was called "Symphonic." And if you went inside there, you could turn on—it called it a D-filter [Dynamic Filter]—and it kind of made this real watery, bubbly sound. He put a lot of his samples through that sometimes.', "For his kick drums, we would use an old oscillator, and I'd let him choose the frequency and an oscillator with the gate… the kick drum would trigger it, but it'd be real tight. There would be no length to it. And it gave you that little bit of extra sub frequencies below the kick. It's like 40 hertz, and then we'd go through a gate. Then the kick would trigger the gate to open up, but it'd be a real short. That's all over that record.", "Bob Power on mixing Dilla and making choices: One of the really cool things about mixing Jay Dee stuff is that there was never any question about which way to go with certain elements. He was so gifted in terms of his choice of sounds as a mixer. There wasn't any question to me—and with well-produced music there's not a lot of questions when you get something to mix.", "In a way, his choice of sounds was for the timbral and frequency content of the sound as much as the sound itself. So he had a really immaculate sense of how things were going to sit together, fit together, sonically. I didn't have to ask him a lot of questions. It was so intelligently put together.", 'Todd Fairall on Fantastic Vol. 2: We did mix that at the studio [Studio A in Detroit]—that was a whole different thing than either The Roots or the Common project, because he [Jay] recorded the majority of that record to ADATs in his basement of his house. Even the vocals and everything, and he would bring it into the studio and I would take those And then we would mix it from the 2-inch tape. So there were overdubs and there was some tracking done at the studio, but the majority of that was recorded at his house. As far as the mix of those records he was the mastermind behind that stuff. I mean, I still felt like I was more of a tool to help him get where he wanted to get to with those. He did a lot. He was real hands-on on the console and stuff, especially when it came to his beats.', 'But when it came to the vocals, he was very hands-off. He had the beat sitting where he wanted it and then he was like, "OK, mix the vocals." And if I had to move stuff in the beat for the vocals, he was perfectly cool with it. Or if I had to move some of the vocals to make room for the beat, It was kind of like a team at that point, but yeah, that sound that you\'re hearing on those records, that\'s all him. I wish I could take credit for it. We were at the console together the whole time, but I wasn\'t reaching over him or anything like that.', 'Bob Power: I felt as a mixer, since he was operating on such an involved level to begin with, it was my job to make sure that the mix reflected that same kind of care and careful intention. I do a lot of high- and low-pass filtering on different elements to keep them out of the way of other things in that particular frequency range.', "I've said this publicly, and I've said in lectures before, but if you go through a track before you sit down to mix and high- and low-pass everything in the track, taking away all the elements, all the components of the different elements that don't really need to be there—meaning, say, for the bass, you low-pass it, and you might high-pass it in a certain sub area below 80 hertz or so, because you want to leave that area for something else, like the bottom on the kick. So, I probably did a lot of high- and low-passing on the stuff just to keep the kaka out of something, to which it was not essential.", 'Dave Cooley on mastering Donuts: I can\'t remember exactly what I did 15 years ago, but I do remember timing releases on the [Crane Song] STC-8 pretty carefully to the track tempos to preserve the really disorienting compression pump, to take that intensity even a little further. The GML EQ was good for adding top end with a "matte" finish; at the time I wasn\'t into slick top end. All that said, it was pretty much done when it arrived and I just sweetened it a bit.', 'Pulling it up, it was already sounding so amazing. I remember thinking the "Lightworks" sample was the one that blew me away the most... but the whole thing was so cool, so clever. I recognized a bunch of the breaks/samples, but they were flipped so hard—he had turned them into something brand new. Honestly I didn\'t know that day that it would be regarded as his most revered piece. It was more like those stories you hear from 1960s\' engineers just rolling up their sleeves for an unassuming day\'s work on a soon-to-be classic. Sometimes it\'s better that way, just shooting from the hip and not tripping out on how important it could be.', "Todd Fairall (on Fantastic Vol. 2): Obviously, I'm obviously very, very biased, but in my opinion, that's like one of the great records of history, you know? That stands with Sgt. Pepper's or Animals by Pink Floyd. I just think the world of that record. I think it's a masterpiece.", "Dave Cooley (on Donuts): I thought it sounded completely captivating, just from a fan's perspective. But to clarify, I don't think J imagined Donuts primarily as a commercial product per se, even though the title is kind of a play on that (as well as an obvious play on the shape of the 45RPM records he sampled). Rather, Donuts was a moment of self-actualization, a moment for him to be completely at ease with himself. It pays homage to the long line of producers and musicians that preceded him, his influences. The record is a thank you note, a realization of mortality, and a goodbye from one of hip-hop's greatest producers. It closes the loop.", "Bob Power: I think something that people who turn knobs sometimes lose sight is that, whether you like what he does or not, James Taylor could make a great record on a phone because of what he does. Biggie could have made a record on a phone, and you still would have gotten the essence of that artistry. And I think Jay's stuff was like that as well. Yeah, it was nice that they asked me to polish it up a little bit, and, you know, make it sound real good and stuff. But what I did was not essential to that, because it was there to begin with.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Eager to see the premier of a new PBS television show called Soundstage, Bloomfield had flown back to San Francisco when he'd been unable to find the program on Vancouver TV.", "He'd left his band stranded and had abandoned the Burst and the rest of his equipment at the club, but back home he did manage to catch Soundstage. The show was a tribute to Muddy Waters called Blues Summit In Chicago, and Bloomfield was one of its featured participants.", 'Since that time, Grozina had kept Bloomfield\'s Les Paul and equipment, intending to hold onto the gear until the guitarist made restitution for money Stan had lost from the cancelled gig. But Bloomfield made no effort to retrieve his storied Gibson, deeming the guitar no great loss. "It was a total wreck," was his only comment. For nearly a year, the Burst sat in The Cave\'s basement, its fate uncertain.', "Then Chris Okey heard about it. He'd come to the club in September 1975 to see Butch Whacks & The Glass Packs, a classic-rock cover band from San Francisco, and backstage after the show the group's guitarist told Okey about the prize in Grozina's basement. Okey knew right away he wanted the Bloomfield Burst.", '"I was in a panic to put some money together because I thought Stan might suddenly sell the guitar to somebody else," Okey told me. "So I did the deal in just two days." He bought the Les Paul for what seemed like an exorbitant sum—$980.', "Okey was a member of a Toronto band called The Whip and, a fine guitarist himself, was well aware of Bloomfield's stature as one of America's great blues-rock players. As a member of The Butterfield Blues Band, Bloomfield had helped introduce Chicago-style blues to a generation and had pioneered psychedelic rock with the group's East-West album of 1966.", "Bloomfield's playing on Bob Dylan's seminal Highway 61 Revisited had charted a new course for the folksinger's career, and his brass-rock group, The Electric Flag, had inspired a whole new genre of big-band pop. Bloomfield was a superb blues improviser, and his sound, closely associated with the Les Paul, had inspired guitarists all around the country to seek out the iconic Gibsons. To actually own Bloomfield's original Burst was like a dream come true.", 'The guitar itself, though, was more like a nightmare. "It was totally beat to hell and was quite ugly," Okey said. "On the back of the neck, about half the finish was missing in huge chunks. That mark behind the tailpiece was another place where the finish was missing, the wood caked with grime, and the tailpiece was all corroded and rusty."', 'Bloomfield was notorious for mistreating his instruments, and the Les Paul had suffered much abuse during the seven years he owned it. But when Okey plugged the guitar in, it became a different instrument altogether.', '"It played as good as it gets, and sounded as good as it gets," Okey said enthusiastically. "I once got to play Duane Allman\'s Burst and there was nothing good about it. I wanted to put it down after ten seconds. But the Bloomfield—that was something special!"', "Okey took the guitar on the road with The Whip, playing venues in Ontario and British Columbia before returning to Toronto in January 1976. In the spring, he had luthier Mike Kinal refinish the back of the neck, making the guitar easier to play. Kinal also replaced Bloomfield's chrome Grover tuners with nickel-plated ones and swapped the truss-rod cover for a more appropriate blank one.", 'When he removed the pickup covers, he discovered that the neck pickup had "zebra coils," meaning one bobbin is black plastic and the other white. That configuration was one some players felt enhanced a guitar\'s sound, and when it came to Bloomfield\'s Burst, Okey felt it probably did.', "More gigging followed, but in 1976, Okey found himself short of funds and decided to sell the legendary Burst. The buyer was a well-known Toronto collector named Ken Goodwin. Goodwin held on to the instrument for half a decade, frequently offering it for sale for as much as $5,000. Finally, in the early '80s, he found a buyer—a collector from the Chicago area named Colin Petroff, who took the guitar back to Illinois, where apparently it has been ever since.", "In 2011, John Picard, known as Mister Zero, the guitarist for the Canadian band The Kings, published a well-researched article about Michael Bloomfield's lost Burst in Vintage Guitar magazine. Chris Okey was one of his sources for the piece, and not long after it was published, I began work on Guitar King, my biography of Michael Bloomfield.", "Picard kindly gave me Okey's email address, and in 2014, we began corresponding. He was very helpful with details about the guitar for my book, but one afternoon in June 2016 he sent me an unusual message.", 'Okey said he\'d called the owner of the Burst that morning and had talked to a woman he assumed was the owner\'s wife. After a short conversation, she\'d hung up on him, but he sensed that she knew more than she let on. Later that evening, he sent me another email, one as dramatic as it was terse: "It\'s him! Don\'t give his number out and don\'t tell anybody. I have an offer for him on it."', 'The "him" was Colin Petroff and the "it" was the Bloomfield Burst. Okey had heard rumors that Petroff was its owner, and that evening he\'d finally confirmed it to his satisfaction. He hoped to broker a sale for an interested buyer, someone he described as a "famous guitar collector in Texas."', "Okey's buyer was offering an extraordinary $1.5 million for the instrument, and Okey was excited about his role as an intermediary. In the past year, he had suffered a number of financial setbacks and had been reduced to living in a motel in Cache Creek, British Columbia. He was also dealing with congestive heart failure, and he hoped the deal might net him a token gratuity, a sum that could help his situation.", 'I waited for news of the transaction, but after days turned into weeks and no word came, I assumed Petroff was not interested in selling. In the end, Okey was unable to close the deal, and the Bloomfield Burst remained in a closet in Illinois. Then, on December 13, 2016, I got word that Chris Okey had died.', "While Michael Bloomfield's other famous guitar, his 1963 Telecaster, has recently been seen in YouTube videos by guitar expert Dan Erlewine, Bloomfield's 1959 Les Paul Standard remains a mystery. That its fate is generally unknown may be due in part to a question of ownership. It is true that Bloomfield abandoned the guitar at The Cave, but no deal was ever made with club owner Stan Grozina to take the instrument as restitution for the cancelled gig.", 'The famed guitarist, who died in 1981, never officially relinquished his claim. So did Grozina have a right to sell it? Did the Burst still belong to Bloomfield even though Chris Okey and subsequent buyers had purchased it? I asked representatives of the Bloomfield Estate for their thoughts.', '"I think it would be very difficult to enforce any claim," Michael\'s younger brother, Randy Bloomfield, said. "It has been out of the family\'s possession for so long."', '"If the Estate could verify that the guitar is authentic, I think we might be interested in seeing how it could be returned," Michael\'s brother, Allen Bloomfield, said. "But with all the time that\'s passed, if there\'s a statute of limitations, us not having the serial number—I really don\'t know. It would be difficult."', "For now, the Michael Bloomfield 1959 Les Paul Standard, a Burst that was reproduced from photographic evidence in a limited-edition signature model by Gibson's Custom Shop in 2009, remains hidden from public view. It was Chris Okey's belief that an American collector named Colin Petroff currently has it, but efforts to locate Mr. Petroff for this article were unsuccessful. Until those circumstances change, it's Okey's research that best answers the question: What ever happened to Michael Bloomfield's '59 Les Paul Burst?", "About the author: David Dann is a music historian, writer, and amateur musician who is the author of Guitar King: Michael Bloomfield's Life In The Blues.

The word "electro," sometimes called "electrofunk," describes a wide breadth of electronic music sounds with more or less the same origins. While it took many forms inside the US and eventually internationally, its most steadfast features are ground-shaking TR-808 percussion in swift, syncopated patterns and motifs that often invoke technology and ponder the future. By my count, electro first appeared in 1981 and was nothing less than the harbinger of hip-hop and techno, created largely by African Americans artists and often inspired by European, synth-focused records.', "It's had a long and fruitful evolution since, seeing occasional resurgences in popularity among DJs and producers while some staunch supporters hold on throughout peaks and valleys. With its return in more recent years to the spotlight on dancefloors and in new release bins, it seems especially worthwhile to examine the history of this portentous genre. Given its complexity and the wealth of subject matter, this piece will only attempt to summarize the major developments in the genre over time and will unfortunately omit many amazing electro tunes—and much of the social context around them—out of sheer necessity.", "We hope this serves as a jumping-off point for more deep dives into this fathomless collection of sounds like the one inspiring this feature. If you're already an expert on the origins of electro, skip to the second section, on Electro's resurgence, below. For everyone else, let's start at the beginning.", 'The early 1980s were an absolute tinderbox for the rapid development of electronic music. As the decade began, synthesizers and drum machines were becoming more commonly found in recording studios and on stage with bands. They helped smooth punk rock into new wave and synth pop while also setting the stage for proto-house, boogie, and computerized funk. But it took a few groundbreaking developments to spark the birth of electro.', 'First, Roland released its first fully programmable drum machine, the TR-808, in 1980. While initially deemed inferior to the vaunted Linn LM-1, it took just a few years before the 808 grew into the backbone of most dance music, eventually becoming the most ubiquitous drum machine sound of all time.', "Early adopters were drawn to its now-iconic synthesized drum sounds and its step-sequencing function, which allowed users to program drum patterns on the fly like never before. But it wasn't until Roland stopped production in 1983 and 808s started showing up in secondhand shops that it became affordable for many producers to own one.", 'Meanwhile, a handful of pioneering artists like Ryuichi Sakamoto of Yellow Magic Orchestra, George Clinton of Parliament-Funkadelic, Gary Numan, D-Train, and Yello were laying the musical groundwork for what came next. Looming over all of them was Kraftwerk, whose thorough embrace of synthesizers and drum machines had already influenced a generation of electronic musicians.', 'But it was their 1981 album, Computer World, and specifically its single "Numbers," which opened the door for electro. With its queasy melodies and clipped, syncopated percussion that would become a hallmark of the genre, the song\'s robotic funk made it an instant favorite of many DJs in the United States. It also increased the group\'s exposure within black and Latino audiences, setting off a musical arms race to react to this revolutionary tune that had become the backing track for many local New York rappers.', 'It was Afrika Bambaataa & Soulsonic Force, with production by Arthur Baker and John Robie, whose record "Planet Rock" had the widest impact and came to define the early electro sound. Released in June 1982 on NYC hip-hop label Tommy Boy, the song featured the Soulsonic Force rapping over bouncing, syncopated 808 beats that interpolated distinctive Kraftwerk melodies. In a 1998 interview, Afrika Bambaataa explained, "I always was into Trans Europa Express, and after Kraftwerk put \'Numbers\' out, I said, \'I wonder if I can combine the two to make something real funky with a hard bass and beat.\' So we combined them." Arthur Baker knew they had musical dynamite on their hands. In a 1999 interview, Baker said, "I went home the night we cut the track and brought the tape home, and I said to my wife at the time, \'We\'ve just made musical history.\'"', 'This proved to be no exaggeration. Not only did the record make its way around the US, spreading the word of hip-hop and electronic beats, it inspired legions of followers wherever it was heard. The New York scene lit up first and brightest in 1982, with Jonzun Crew\'s "Pack Jam," Warp 9\'s "Nunk", Planet Patrol\'s "Play At Your Own Risk" (also produced by Baker and Robie), and Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five\'s "Scorpio" all extrapolating on the territory covered by "Planet Rock" with 808 beats and talkbox vocals.', 'The momentum behind the sound picked up in 1983 as it diversified, with seminal, mostly instrumental cuts like Man Parrish\'s "Hip Hop, Be Bop (Don\'t Stop)" and Hashim\'s "Al-Naafiysh (The Soul)" demonstrating how powerful it could be even without MCs.', 'The immensely talented band Newcleus got their start with "Jam On Revenge" in 1983, and their inventive 1984 singles "Computer Age (Push The Button)" and "Jam On It" would cement their place in electro history. Baker and Robie continued to craft foundational tracks like New Order\'s "Confusion," Freeez\'s "I.O.U.," Soulsonic Force\'s "Looking For the Perfect Beat", and Nairobi\'s "Funky Soul Makossa," launching the Streetwise label to release them and many other electro records.', 'Even legendary pianist Herbie Hancock got in on the action, releasing the Grammy-winning, scratched up electro tune "Rockit," which lent respectability to the burgeoning genre and added to its already swelling audience.', 'The arrival of Kraftwerk\'s "Numbers" and then "Planet Rock" sent aural shockwaves through music scenes around the US, which were perhaps felt deepest in Detroit. The music of Parliament-Funkadelic, Prince, and many new wave records had already primed the pump for funky electronic sounds, inspiring Juan Atkins and Richard Davis to form Cybotron in 1981 and record the scrappy but powerful single "Alleys Of Your Mind." Although not as widely cited as "Planet Rock," its syncopated rhythms and chilly synth work suggest it was perhaps the original electro tune.', 'Over Skype, Atkins told me, "The reason I was doing electronic [music] was because I lived in a place where I couldn\'t get other band members, so I had to put these songs together by myself. That is where technology and electronics helped." Incredibly, he was in New York promoting the second Cybotron single, "Cosmic Cars," at the moment "Planet Rock" landed. "As soon as we pulled into the city, one station had an exclusive of this mystery record, and it just lit up the airwaves," Atkins explains. "And it was already a year behind."', 'Cybotron\'s 1983 record "Clear" established the duo as heavyweights in the electro arena. Mixed by Jose "Animal" Diaz, who also worked with Jonzun Crew in New York, its instantly memorable whirling motifs would go on to be hugely influential and widely sampled, most notably for Missy Elliot\'s 2005 single "Lose Control." Many have cited "Clear" as the original techno track as well, which says a lot about the slippery boundaries between the genres.', 'Atkins\' longer lived solo project, Model 500, launched in 1985 and contributed crucial electro cuts like "Night Drive (Thru-Babylon)," as well as more or less writing the manual for Detroit techno generally. He even made electro records under other names and in various collaborations. "Technicolor," his Channel One release with Doug Craig, even ended up being interpolated into Sir Mix-a-Lot\'s smash hit, "Baby Got Back." With the rare outlier of Erik Travis\' Sound Of Mind releases in 1987 and 1988, few other Detroit electro artists emerged during the \'80s. However, they would go on to play a dominant role in the sound of electro in the early \'90s as New York\'s influence waned. More on that later.', 'As the first wave of electro was reaching its peak around 1984, a new electro scene was blossoming in Los Angeles. Here the biggest electro acts emphasized rapping as much as the hard-edged beats beneath their lyrics, serving as precursors to LA\'s fertile hip-hop heritage. In fact, familiar names like Dr. Dre and Yella of N.W.A. fame got their start in the World Class Wreckin\' Cru, with scratch-heavy cuts "Surgery" and "He\'s Bionic" helping to define the scene. Mik Lezan, known both as Arabian Prince and Professor X, was also making Prince-influenced electro cuts and harder street beats before he joined N.W.A. Ice-T initially launched his rap career with electro tunes, such as "The Coldest Rap," with musical contributions from members of The Time. Another pillar of the scene was The Unknown DJ, the artist behind classic electro records "Beatronic" and "Basstronic" and the label owner of Techno Hop Records, which released many LA electro records. He also collaborated with DJ Slip as The X-Men, a project whose few sample-heavy singles were well received in LA and Detroit.', 'But the city\'s biggest electro export was undoubtedly Egyptian Lover, an intensely charismatic producer and vocalist who is one of the few original electro artists still active today. Originally the producer for Uncle Jamm\'s Army and the Radio Crew (with Ice-T), the man born Greg Broussard went solo in 1984 with "Egypt, Egypt" and never looked back. "When I first heard that Kraftwerk album with \'Numbers\' on it, I lost my mind and said to myself, \'I need to make a rap over that crazy electronic beat," Broussard told Infinitestatemachine in 2009, adding, "... Soulsonic Force beat me to it, and when I heard \'Planet Rock\' I was like, \'Ahhhh that is what I was gonna do.\' But it only inspired me more to create a style similar to this. Prince and Kraftwerk were my main influences."', "On the opposite coast, another branch of the electro tree sprung up in Miami between 1984-85. Like in LA and New York, the electro sound was a springboard for the city's hip-hop scene and its own mutation called Miami Bass. As one might expect, Miami's artists emphasized the bass lines in their 808-clad beats and injected Latin influences as well.", 'The most famous electro tune to come out of Miami was Freestyle\'s 1985 smash, "Don\'t Stop The Rock", whose flashy melodies lit up dancefloors and radio stations well beyond the coast of Florida. MC A.D.E. was among the city\'s first electro artists, releasings the singles "Bass Rock Express" and "Bass Mechanic," which helped lay out the template for Miami Bass.', 'Scene stalwarts Maggotron and Dynamix II started off as devoted "Planet Rock" followers but went on to create a musical bridge between early electro and Miami Bass. And while more associated with Miami Bass, even 2 Live Crew\'s first musical forays, "The Revelation" and "Throw The D," were electro in style.', 'In the early \'80s, the UK was already suffused in synth-pop courtesy of Gary Numan, Depeche Mode, New Order, and many more when electro first struck a chord with British audiences. Greg Wilson, a Manchester-based DJ who was present at the moment and instrumental to the genre\'s success in his country, describes the scene in great detail on his tremendous resource, Electrofunkroots.co.uk. By his telling, rap first arrived on their side of the Atlantic via records like Sugarhill Gang\'s "Rapper\'s Delight" and Grandmaster Flash\'s "The Message."', 'But it was actually notorious trend-hunter Malcolm McLaren, former Sex Pistols and New York Dolls manager, who gave the UK its "first true insight into the street culture that had developed in New York," according to Wilson. For his 1982 single, "Buffalo Gals," he recruited veteran songwriter and producer Trevor Horn, later of Art of Noise fame, to record and produce the sample-heavy track.', 'In addition to McLaren\'s own stilted vocals, he included scratching and a sample sourced by the World\'s Famous Supreme Team, two MCs recruited during the visit to the Bronx that introduced McLaren to hip-hop, electro, and the technique of scratching. Paired with a video that featured breakdancing by the Bronx-based Rock Steady Crew, "Buffalo Girls" opened British eyes to the possibilities of hip-hop and these fresh dance moves. The record even made it to number nine in the UK Singles charts.', 'Suddenly the demand for the novel sounds and distinctly urban aesthetic emanating from the Bronx grew astronomically. English promoter Morgan Khan launched the label StreetSounds to cater to b-boy culture springing up across England. Their "Street Sounds Electro" compilation series not only branded the entire genre, they delivered hit tracks by the biggest American hip-hop and electro artists to audiences who would\'ve never found import copies themselves. Surprisingly, the popularity of the music didn\'t inspire many Brits to have a go at making their own electro tracks. Greg Wilson, along with members of Magazine and A Certain Ratio, and the rappers Kermit and Fiddz, recorded tracks under a variety of aliases for "Street Sounds UK Electro," another Morgan Khan compilation with respectable chart success. But their efforts proved to be surprisingly singular with the exception of the Baker-produced "I.O.U." from English jazz-funk band Freeez. It wasn\'t until the early \'90s that many British artists offered their own take on electro.', "As the '80s wore on, many of the hip-hop oriented scenes opted to keep the 808 beats of electro and leave the futurist themes in favor of party-oriented, street-level observations more commonly found in rap. House music moved from Chicago's underground sensation to a world-beating sound. Techno was growing rapidly in Detroit and starting to spread as well. Acid house took off like wildfire in the UK. And what of electro? It was still being played, although more selectively, by adventurous DJs. Most of the artists moved on to these newer genres, which were still fresh and full of even more possibilities. But electro was still to see a major resurgence in the 1990s.", "As the ‘80s gave way to the ‘90s, electro was simply no longer in vogue. Its role as the predecessor of hip-hop and techno didn’t do much for music lovers caught up in those full-fledged genres, or, similarly, for fans of house, acid house, and Miami bass. While electro records stayed in some DJs’ crates, many first-wave electro artists moved along with the crowd and tried their hands at one of the fresher sounds. Though future generations would take up the torch, electro never again achieved the broad popularity of 1982-'85.", 'This had consequences for its sound, as well. Unencumbered by popular expectations, subsequent waves of electro producers found new touchstones for their own derivations of the genre. Most eschewed the hip-hop element altogether, doubling down on science fiction and tech-driven themes whose nerdiness often matched that of their diehard fans. Although electro remained a niche sound, there was a global resurgence in the number of artists making electro during the ‘90s, the stylistic wave rising highest in 1997. Like waves do, this crashed in the early aughts and has returned again a couple of times since.', 'The city of Detroit was a rare oasis for both offsprings of the original electro sound. While holding tight to seminal works by Juan Atkins, the Motor City’s embrace of West Coast electro and Miami bass was so complete its audiences didn’t know that some of their favorite songs weren’t created there. All of these sounds and more were swirled together by local DJs on the radio and at parties, many of whom emulated the mercurial blends and crowd-stoking selections of a young Jeff Mills, who spun records as the Wizard on WJLB and WDRQ during the late ‘80s.', '"A lot of it was just based off of street music in Detroit," attests Brian Gillespie, aka Detroit’s DJ Starski, a longtime DJ, producer, and label owner. "Detroit radio was god back then. The DJ had the opportunity to do what he wanted, not be controlled by some music director. At night they\'d play Miami bass music. It was a huge deal here, especially 2 Live Crew, because the sounds they were using were electro sounds." As this eclectic, booty-shaking style grew in popularity on Detroit radio and the trendsetting New Dance Show, new producers turned up to provide fresh material. Known initially as either "booty" or "ghetto" style at the time, this became a scene unto itself during the ‘90s. More on that a bit later.', 'Not everyone in Detroit was eager to participate in "electro." According to Detroit music specialist, Brendan M. Gillen, better known as the Detroit-based DJ, producer, and label owner BMG, electro had become a dirty word for many producers. "It had become top 40 music—Madonna even tries it out," Gillen explains, "Nobody in Detroit wants to be associated with Top 40." What’s more, hip-hop and booty/ghetto music were seen as soundtracking the booming crack cocaine trade that had gripped urban America. "If you were involved in advancing consciousness [as a producer], you\'d not be working on that," Gillen added. Detroit producers making what we now consider electro were firmly committed to classifying it as techno.', 'Still, such infectious sounds couldn’t help but influence producers who made up the second wave of Detroit electro. At the forefront was Keith Tucker, a prolific producer who recorded under a handful of aliases like Optic Nerve and KT-19941. But he’s best known as half of Aux 88 with Tommy Hamilton, a duo still active today. Making their debut in 1993 on Tucker’s Direct Beat imprint, the duo prioritized booming bass sounds among their technology-focused lyrics. In a 2010 video interview, Hamilton described the Aux 88 sound as "techno bass" rather than electro—"a fusion of Detroit techno and Miami bass sounds." Together, they made some of the most compelling records of that era, like "My A.U.X. Mind," "Direct Drive," "Break It Down," and many more.', 'Direct Beat itself was a treasure trove of audacious electro records by Will Web, DJ Di’jital, Posatronix, and even Mike Banks under his Electric Soul guise. Banks was already well ensconced in electro through his massively influential label/distro, Submerge as well as mid- and late-’90s Underground Resistance cuts like "Acid Africa" and "Codebreaker," as well as Remote’s "Protecting My Hive." Many other Detroit producers took their turn at making electro as well, such as, Scott Grooves under his Sole Tech guise on his Detrechno label, Aaron-Carl, and James Pennington, aka Suburban Knight. Juan Atkins’ Metroplex label, already the home to many of his releases, was also a hub for Detroit electro and techno acts, including more booty-oriented records by Erotek, Aaron-Carl, and Juan’s own X-Ray alias.', 'Afrofuturism—an aesthetic that explores the intersection of African-American history and culture with the development of technology—is a near constant within Detroit electro and techno. The duo Drexciya embodied this approach even more than most, with singular works telling the story of an underseas civilization with roots in the American slave trade through futuristic electro music. Debuting in 1992 with "Deep Sea Dweller," this most famous collaboration between Gerald Donald and James Stinson saw them plunge into uncharted, experimental territory in electro and techno throughout the ‘90s into the early 2000s.', 'The group’s liner notes—sometimes scant, other times extensive—laid out the group’s mystical backstory. Early releases on Shockwave, Submerge, and Underground Resistance led to EPs on Aphex Twin’s Rephlex label, Warp Records, and albums for Tresor and Clone, all which helped spread the group’s influence and the mythology rapidly building around them. They released sporadic dispatches until 2002, when the project came to an end as Stinson passed away in September of that year.', 'In the late ‘90s and early 2000s, Donald and Stinson began to branch out from the Drexciya name with dozens of solo projects, each exemplary of the many sonic possibilities that fall under the umbrella of electro. They are too numerous to name them all—it’s estimated there are still projects no one knows about—but a few from each member must be highlighted. James Stinson didn’t have as much time as his Drexciyan partner to spread out, but he still left a considerable solo legacy. It’s believed he was the driving force behind Elecktroids, whose 1995 album, "Elektroworld" on Warp Records, sounds like Drexciya as land-dwellers with well-worn copies of every Kraftwerk LP.', 'Far more influential was The Other People Place, a warm yet melancholic electro project with unexpectedly human themes, which yielded the utterly classic 2001 album, Lifestyles Of The Laptop Café for Warp. Two strange and enjoyable albums under the alias Transllusion showcased Stinson pushing at his own boundaries, while the posthumously released the Lab Rat XL album Mice Or Cyborg bristles with energy and sharp edges.', 'Gerald Donald was far more prolific even during the Drexciya days, with Dopplereffekt, debuting in 1995, looming largest over all his many projects. Rebranding himself as the German-sounding Rudolf Klorzeiger, he recruited a small rotating cast of collaborators and, at least initially, drew upon the sick experimentation of Nazi scientists for thematic grist, turning electro’s Kraftwerkian roots on their head while hewing closely to their precise, computerized palette. Dopplereffekt are still active today, although Donald—these days adopting the more problematic name Heinrich Mueller, shared with the head of the Gestapo—still launches new aliases and collaborations regularly. Other fan-favorite Gerald Donald projects include the technology-obsessed Arpanet and Japanese Telecom, as well as collaborative efforts with Der Zyklus, Zwischenwelt, and earlier releases as Ectomorph with BMG.', 'Operating more or less in parallel with this sci-fi heavy scene in the mid-’90s was the aforementioned booty or ghetto style, inspired by the harder edges and vulgar lyrics of Miami bass, Professor X and the X-Men from LA, and Chicago’s Dance Mania label. Eventually labeled as "ghettotech" by journalist Hobey Echlin, its sound is incredibly fast, banging, and often lyrically filthy—perfect for keeping parties jumping.', 'DJ Godfather and DJ Dick, two of the scene’s architects, got their start in 1993 making sample-heavy electro records under the name Bass Association. At the time there was huge demand but very little supply of the Miami bass records that inspired them, spurring them to meet that demand on their own. They’d go on to found Twilight 76 Records with Brian Gillespie to showcase more of this sound. Soon after, they launched the Databass sub-label, whose strictly party cuts "ghetto" sound—and records like DJ Godfather’s "Mr. Big Dick" and DJ Nasty’s "Blaze It Up"—proved quite popular in Detroit.', 'DJ Assault was among the best-known DJs and producers of ghettotech, as well as the label head for Electrofunk Records. Together with Mr. De, he produced notorious tracks like "Ass-N-Titties," which are well known even outside ghettotech circles. Even producers like Rick Wade and Dan Bell, better known for their deep house and minimal techno records, got in on the action. Several other regional variants of this type of appeared in Baltimore, New Jersey, and elsewhere, although they feel less inspired by electro than their Midwestern relatives.', 'Swept away by the much-hyped arrival of acid house in the UK, electro splintered there much as it did in the U.S. Hip-hop and breakdancing had won a much larger audience, and no one inspired by the heady days of ‘82-’85 made music describable as electro until the early 1990s. At that point it was generally a discarded sound, something to be referenced and built upon. Jonathan Saul Kane was among the first on the scene’s second wave in 1989.', 'His releases under the name The Octagon Man embraced the genre’s focus on technology and 808 drum programming, putting aside the breakbeat/trip-hop music he was making as Depth Charge. After a five-year break, the Octagon Man alias returned in 1995 with the album, The Exciting World Of…, pushing deeper into electro territory with the influence of Detroit clearly present. He also had a hand in running the labels Vinyl Solution, Electron Industries, and D.C. Recordings, which released his music and much more.', 'Participating in b-boy culture was a common early entry point into dance music for many UK producers. The esteemed duo of Mark Bell and Gez Varley first met when part of rival breakdance crews in the mid-’80s. Linking up again in college, the pair formed LFO and released their self-titled debut in 1990 for Warp Records. While clearly informed by Chicago house and Detroit techno, the syncopated percussion of "Simon from Sydney" and the talkbox vocals of "We Are Back" are just a couple examples of how electro influenced their early releases.', 'Mark Pritchard and Tom Middleton, most widely known for their mid-’90s ambient techno alias Global Communication, went on to form Jedi Knights in 1996. Here, the duo fondly recalled the funky synth lines of ‘80s electro with buoyant singles on Clear and releases on their own Evolution label. Well respected as a techno producer and DJ, Dave Clarke proved his electro fan credentials with scene-setting mix CDs "X-Mix - Electro Boogie" and "Electro Boogie Vol 2 - The Throwdown." Even Richard D. James, aka Aphex Twin, toyed with electro rhythms in some of his early ‘90s productions.', 'One of the biggest electro artists to emerge in this era was Ed "DMX" Upton, better known as DMX Krew. A solid Kraftwerk fan by age 9 and early adopter of the UK Street Sounds Electro compilations, Upton embraced everything electro, from Cybotron’s "Clear" to Maggotron, during his formative years. Surprisingly, his first records were more techno in nature, but soon it became clear electro was a better outlet for his creativity.', '"I just kinda realized I was never gonna get ahead of Jeff Mills and Robert Hood doing techno," Upton told me over the phone. "I thought, ‘I’ve got to find my own little niche where I can be unique rather than try to chase someone else.’ Maybe I wasn’t enough of a genius to invent my own style, so I looked back to an old style that was wildly out of fashion." His 1996 debut album, Sound Of The Street, for the Rephlex label, cannily worked its way through electro styles, flush with melodically colorful synth sounds throughout.', 'Upton further championed electrofunk sounds by founding the labels Breakin’ Records and Fresh Up Records, providing homes for UK electro producers Mandroid, Bass Junkie, and his own productions under a number of names like Computor Rockers and Bass Potato. But this didn’t necessarily translate into popularity at home.', '"There weren’t clubs to go to that were playing it—it was kind of a thing for some nerds, at least in London. I would clear a dance floor. I was kinda lucky because I was on Rephlex, which was a pretty experimental, wide-ranging label, so if I’d do gigs with Rephlex the crowd would be pretty open-minded. But not always. There were times when I had bottles thrown at me or god knows what." The DMX Krew sound expanded to include everything from synthpop to drum ‘n bass as the novelty of electro wore off over time. "Yeah, I could sit down and knock out early Breakin’ Records-style electro tracks easily—I could do a couple every day, but I would be bored," Upton admits, "There’d be no artistic merit in it whatsoever."', 'If electro was something of a niche sound in the UK, it was an even greater rarity in Germany. It seems unthinkable that the fatherland of Kraftwerk wouldn’t be an electro hotbed, with their influence overflowing everywhere else. Yet it seems their daunting stature may have convinced other German artists to avoid the comparison entirely by working their own angles, often expressed through EBM and industrial music instead. Only a few made a real impact during this same fertile time period.', 'As a producer, DJ Hell has never been shy of trying on new styles, and electro was one he touched on briefly. But as the labelhead of International Deejay Gigolo Records, Hell was a staunch advocate of electro and electro-derived sounds. Catching its stride in the late ‘90s, the label’s offerings included multiple releases by Gerald Donald, DMX Krew’s most overt Kraftwerk tribute record, "Showroom Dummies," breakout records of future electroclash champions Miss Kittin & The Hacker, Tiga, and Fischerspooner. Only fellow German label Disko B can claim a similarly broad and electro-focused discography, the home of records by Dutch electro heroes Unit Moebius and I-F (more on them later), Austrian producer Patrick Pulsinger, and dozens more.', 'Perhaps the most prominent German electro producer is Anthony Rother, who emerged from Offenbach, near Frankfurt, in the late ‘90s. Gritty and melancholic, his 1997 debut album, Sex With The Machines proved there was still more to be said within electro. Tracks like "Human Made" and "Love Is For The Hardest People" bear the influences of Kraftwerk and Detroit electro while offering a decidedly human take on technology driven themes. Rother became something of a one-man cottage industry of electro music beginning in 1998, when he launched the electro-focused Psi49net label and released a bevy of records under his own name and as Little Computer People. As his popularity grew, he founded the Datapunk label in 2003 for even more electro-influenced music, including with Sven Väth.', 'Like DJ Hell, Rother was not shy of trends, and he made music compatible with the popular forms of electro that saw brief, fitful revivals in the early and mid-aughts—electroclash and electro-house. Whether fairly or not, Rother is seen as a driving force behind the latter—a style which fused humming, distorted "electro" synth lines with house rhythms that became immensely popular around 2005-’06. He’s stayed prolific as ever while continuing to explore music other than electro, adding new monikers to his discography and collaborating regularly along the way.', 'Just for clarity’s sake, we need to briefly backtrack to a mini-genre mentioned a couple times above. Coined "electroclash" by New York DJ and promoter Larry Tee, the style saw associated artists jamming together synth pop, new wave, punk, and electro percussion, often leading with disaffected vocals and including more female artists. Although it can track its roots to I-F’s classic 1997 cut "Space Invaders Are Smoking Grass," and was greatly nurtured by 1998’s "Frank Sinatra" and "1982" by Miss Kittin & The Hacker, electroclash proliferated globally within a few years, often thanks to International Deejay Gigolo Records.', 'Around the turn of the millenium this led to synthpop-oriented groups like Ladytron from the UK, the theatrically inclined Fischerspooner from New York and their massive single "Emerge", delightfully vulgar punk sounds from Canadian artist Peaches, and even the cold and Kraftwerkian Detroit duo ADULT. Canadian producer Tiga also found his early footing in electroclash.', 'The mini-genre’s popular highpoint was perhaps 2001’s Kittenz and Thee Glitz album by Felix Da Housecat, written in collaboration with Miss Kittin, Tommie Sunshine, Junior Sanchez, Dave the Hustler, and more. Its successful singles "Silver Screen Shower Scene" and "Madame Hollywood" both featured Miss Kittin’s signature deadpan vocals and put the sound on the map for many electroclash latecomers (myself included).', 'Already reaching diminishing returns in 2003 while becoming somewhat commercially successful, electroclash more or less dissolved in the years after, letting loose its artists and fans into other forms of indie dance music, much like electro before it.', "No history of electro would be complete without acknowledging all that the Dutch have contributed to the genre—or those dance artists bringing the always forward-looking genre into the future. Below, we're tracing electro in the Netherlands through the expanse of contemporary labels and artists across the world that continue to push the boundaries of electro in the present day.", 'There cannot be a history of electro without covering the major contributions of Dutch artists and labels. I’ve saved them for last only to be sure they get the proper recognition. According to Serge, founder of Dutch music retailer and scene-defining record label Clone Records, early electro music found a receptive audience in the Netherlands. "Holland was big with US imports in the 80s," Serge told me over email, "Loads of disco and electro found its way to the Netherlands." Electronic music in general stayed popular in the Netherlands, developing a booming club culture for house, techno, electro, and more.', "In 1992, Serge founded the label Clone as a home for his own productions as Orx and Cospagon. Electro flavors came into play in 1997-’98, with EPs by Pamétex and Cosmic Force. The Men You'll Never See E.P., a compilation featuring Detroit In Effect and ADULT. alongside Dutch artists Electronome and I-F, helped cement the connection between their scenes and with Clone more specifically. The Rotterdam-based label group, which over time grew to many Clone sub-labels for everything from classic Chicago house to cutting-edge house and techno, has been instrumental in preserving the legacy of Detroit electro masters Drexciya, whether through reissues of classic material or the wealth of original solo material released by its members on the Clone Aqualung Series imprint.", 'Clone also played an important role in building up the Dutch electro scene. It started the Djak-Up-Bitch label in 1997 to host electro and experimental electronic music, added Clone West Coast Series in 2009 for newer electro by Legowelt, Versalife, The Exaltics, and others, and it provided a home for Duplex, Alden Tyrell, Funckarma and many more local talents. This is to say nothing of the many branches of Clone that deal with house or techno, of which there are many.', 'Around the same time Serge opened Clone, Dutch dance pioneers Unit Moebius got their start in 1992, issuing no-nonsense, tattered bangers on Guy Tavares’ label, Bunker Records. Consisting of Jan Duivenvoorden, Guy Tavares, Ferenc E. van der Sluijs, and Richard Van Den Bogaert, the group swung wildly between techno, acid, and electro, inspired by and serving as the Dutch counterpart to Detroit’s Underground Resistance. Unit Moebius stayed musically abundant until 2008 when they abruptly cut off communication. Even today, however, the Bunker and its sub-labels remain critical to Dutch dance music and as a home for artists around the world who bring punk energy to their tracks, like Rude 66, Legowelt, Luke Eargoggle, The Exaltics, and Syncom Data, to mention just a few.', 'That raw, distorted sounds are a recurring feature in Dutch electro can be attributed at least in part to Ferenc E. van der Sluijs, better known as the DJ and producer Interr-Ference, or I-F for short. Based in the Hague, I-F was not only a member of Unit Moebius, but a prolific producer and label owner who, from the mid-’90s on, blanketed record store shelves with his darker, at times dystopian, vision of techno and electro. Obviously a devoted pupil of the electro sound and a self-proclaimed fetishist for violent 1970s Italian films, his own records combine the geeky scientific subject matter of his Detroit peers with a ribald sense of humor surpassing that of Miami bass and Detroit booty music. Take for example, his 1994 debut record entitled Portrait Of A Dead Girl 1: The Cause, or his breakout hit, "Space Invaders Are Smoking Grass," on his breakthrough album, Fucking Consumer. His music similarly smudged together acid, electro, Italo, and techno to form dirty, distorted, mutant tracks best blasted in the squats where he threw scruffy acid parties.', 'I-F’s DIY approach included releasing the bulk of his music under a clutch of aliases—among them Jungian Archetype, Beverly Hills 808303, and HOTT—on a seemingly endless supply of his own record labels. Between 1994-’96 he birthed four record labels, the short-lived Interr-Ference Communications, followed by Reference Analogue Audio, Viewlexx, and Murder Capital. The latter two remain active, continuing to celebrate the blending of electro with other dance music styles by fellow Dutchmen Electronome, DJ Overdose, Freak Electronique, Alden Tyrell, Ingmar Pauli, and Gesloten Cirkel, to highlight just a handful.', 'As influential as his records and labels are, I-F’s notoriety is also the result of his eclectic DJing style. Before he was an acid freak and electro devotee, I-F was drawn to dance music through Italo disco. Yet it caught many party promoters off guard when the gruff looking I-F climbed into the DJ booth and forewent the endless sonic assaults one might expect based on his releases, instead threading together techno, Italo, electro, and acid house as if they were all one sound. More importantly, he connected the dots between Italo and electro, two surprisingly compatible genres whose overlapping synth aesthetics inspired several producers to create their own original blends. I-F’s genre-hopping style is captured most faithfully on his 1999 mix CD, Mixed Up In the Hague Vol.1, which both lit the fuse of an Italo disco renaissance and became up one of the most famous mixes of all time. I-F further stoked this Italo renewal with his Cybernetic Broadcasting System internet radio station, built on the back of years of doing pirate radio. After six years of highlighting the best and most obscure Italo records, CBS closed up shop, only to be replaced in 2008 by Intergalactic FM, an even more ambitious internet radio station that shows no signs of slowing down.', 'Such are the depths of the Netherlands’ love for electro that, amazingly, we’ve only scratched the surface of the Dutch scene so far. Although I could write a whole feature on their contributions alone, I’ll have to settle for covering a few more key figures and labels without whom any discussion of electro would remain incomplete. Having left off in the Hague, we might as well start with the label Crème Organization from the same electro hub. Founded in 2000 by Jeroen Van Der Star aka DJ TLR, Crème was clearly influenced by its Dutch predecessors in releasing electro with raw edges and the occasional Italo arpeggios. International in scope from the start, the label recruited Finnish producer Sami Liuski to release under a number of aliases, as well as Danny Wolfers under his Legowelt and Polarius monikers, and Orgue Electronique. Though its remit and renown has broadened significantly since the early days to include rough-hewn house and techno, electro remains close to TLR’s heart.', 'Meanwhile in Rotterdam, Wilco Klen van Bennekom, a close associate of Clone best known as the producer Ovatow, launched his label Frustrated Funk in 2002. Like his contemporaries at Crème, Klen looked outside of the Netherlands for many of its releases. Well connected in the US, the label showcased Detroit producers like Der Zyklus and Cybonix, Silicon from North Carolina, Dallas, Texas-based producer E.R.P. (even better known as Convextion), as well as LA’s Santiago Salazar under his electro moniker Seldom Seen, and Seattle’s 214. Along with the rest of the international cast, this makes for a more diverse slate of electro sounds—from swift and scrappy and to softer and spacey—than most electro labels manage. Frustrated Funk is also the proud parent of more techno-influenced sub-labels, Harbour City Sorrow and Frantic Flowers.', 'For Remy Verheijen, who hails from just outside Amsterdam and produces primarily as Dexter, electro is just one part of his sonic arsenal. Although more house- and techno-oriented these days, Dexter’s earlier records, starting around 2000, lean strongly on richly melodic electrofunk sounds more commonly found in early New York records. Many came out on his Klakson label, which hosted dozens more electro records by friends and peers. He ran the label in partnership with Dutch DJ and producer Steffi, a proud advocate of electro music who founded her own solo outlets for said music: Dolly, Dolly Dubs, and Dolly Deluxe. Her love for the sound comes through in her own productions, especially her albums Power of Anonymity and World of the Waking State, where an electro pulse runs throughout her multifaceted sound.', 'Last but not definitely least is longtime Dutch scene veteran Alden Tyrell. While he himself professes no great love for electro, favoring the influence of Euro and Italo disco, it’s undeniable that some of his early greats like "Love Explosion" and "Disco Lunar Module" scratch the same itch. Having been involved in the Dutch scene since the early ’90s, Tyrell’s records can be found all over the discographies of Viewlexx, Crème, and Clone and many of its subsidiaries. And as a mastering engineer, Tyrell purports to have put finishing touches on 90 percent of the music released on Clone, several records for Crème and Murder Capital, and many, many more.', 'The last few years have seen electro enter another one of its periodic upswings in popularity, with electro DJs, labels, and producers all once again in higher demand. This wave comes in the wake of Clone reissuing a large portion of Drexciya’s catalog, which I’ve noticed helped spark more interest in the genre and has led to more producers influenced by the legendary aquatic duo. Yet with the whole history of electro available for anyone to hear online, contemporary electro music ends up both multifaceted and heavily influenced by the past.', 'In this last section, I hope to highlight just a few of the key artists and labels who stand at the forefront of the scene as we know it now—many of whom have been active within it for years and are just now getting their due. And of course, many of the artists discussed earlier in this article are still active and making electro today, but don’t need to be included again.', 'There are a few UK-based record labels leading the electro pack and Central Processing Unit (CPU) is undoubtedly at the forefront. Founded by Chris Smith, a DJ and producer based in Sheffield, CPU got off to a running start in 2012 and quickly became the hottest hub for electro and electro-adjacent sounds. With a roster that’s included veterans DMX Krew, B12, Paul Blackford, and Neil Landstrumm, as well as provided a crucial outlet for producers on the rise, CPU releases span IDM, ambient, electro, techno, and more, sometimes even within a single release. Since 2016, the label’s output has more than doubled to nearly 20 records per year, yet the quality has remained high overall. My favorites of the more recent crop include Nadia Struiwigh’s dripping-with-detail album Lenticular, Alek Stark’s classic-styled Blueshifted People, and the brooding Subtle Variance EP by the late producer Microlith.', 'Another leading light is Bass Agenda Recordings, which got its start as an electro-focused radio show back in 2012. One year later, founder Andy Barton added a label component that issued fresh electro music at a rapid clip. Among its numerous releases you’ll find everything from dark, industrial sounds to more esoteric techno tunes. You’d need to be a keen follower of more modern electro to recognize many of the names here, but underground veterans like Franck Kartell, Bass Junkie, and ATIX litter the Bass Agenda discography. My picks of their recent releases include Jostronamer’s Rogue, the aggressive Cerebus EP by RXmode, and Semantic4’s Terminus album.', 'The London-based Brokntoys label also got its start in 2013, trafficking in both electro and techno with electro-reminiscent percussion. While a bit more focused and sparing in releases when compared with its aforementioned peers, the label has a high hit-to-miss ratio bolstered by records from Versalife, Marco Bernardi, Luke Eargoggle, and Scape One. I’m also partial to the techno/electro hybrid record "Drama in Decay" by Gamma Intel, a more subtle EP by XY0815 called "Exahertz," and the proper club cuts on Vertical67’s "Morphed Reality" EP.', 'And while dozens more labels could be included here, we’ll wrap up with London’s Cultivated Electronics. Started in 2007 by Philip Bolland, better known as the producer Sync 24, the label has made its name as much with various artist comps as with big named artists. These EP-length comps draw in electro producers from all over the spectrum, highlighting producers who have gone on to be hotly tipped by DJs and in the press, such as DeFeKT, Morphology, Privacy, and Jepsen Interceptor. You’ll also find its back catalog stocked with collaborative records between Sync 24 and in-demand artists like Radioactive Man, The Exaltics, and Carl A. Finlow (more on him below) under his Silicon Scally guise.', "Yes, let’s begin this section with Carl A. Finlow. Carl is one of those enduring producers who pops up all over the history of UK house and electro from the early ‘90s onward. He collaborated often in his early career, most famously making house music with Ralph Lawson under names like 20:20 Vision and Wolf n' Flow. But Finlow was quite prolific in general. Author of many worthy house and techno tracks, it’s his pronounced interest in electro— starting in ‘96—that gets my attention. As Voice Stealer, Finlow innovated what electro could be, bending the fleet-footed percussion of electro around experimental sounds and samples on the 1997 album The All Electric House and 1998’s Electromotive Force EP, both for Subvert. Together with Daz Quayle he formed IL.EK.TRO in 1998, which yielded two boundary pushing and entertaining EPs for Klang Elektronik and a more damaged version of their sound in 2004 for Modern Love. Yet Finlow’s most prolific electro project is Silicon Scally, which has come out with seven albums and two dozen EPs worth of extremely diverse electro music since 1998. And with more recent releases on Cultivated Electronics, CPU, and Electrix Records, he’s just as relevant today as during the ‘90s.", 'Since Gerald Donald has more or less separated himself from Drexciya, there remains only one Drexciyan family member flying the flag: Sherard Ingram. Already an established producer under the name Urban Tribe, Ingram became the "assault DJ" for a Drexciya tour and earned the moniker DJ Stingray. Since donning his signature black balaclava in 2007, he’s held true to Drexciya’s legacy by restlessly experimenting and pushing boundaries in his solo productions. In a recent interview with Resident Advisor, he pointed out how often in electro, "these guys are trying to recapture the \'80s. Stop sticking with the paradigms of the past. Sound like the 21st century. Blow our minds." In addition to releases for WéMè Records, NakedLunch, Unknown To the Unknown, and more, DJ Stingray has become one of electro’s most sought-after advocates on the DJing circuit.', 'One artist who has made sure to aim outside the margins of the expected is Glaswegian producer Mark Kastner, aka Galaxian to fans of modern electro. While you can hear traces of Detroit’s fast-paced, booty-focused rhythms in his productions, Kastner draws outside those lines to make unique hybrids between electro and other forms of electronic music. The result is cinematic in scope, gripping in its often ominous tones, and unlike any of his peers. Alongside the Blowback EP for Foul-Up, his three EPs for Dutch electro haven Shipwrec—including one appearing opposite of DJ Stingray—find him in his finest form: uncompromisingly diverse, downcast, and innovative.', 'The Berlin-based DJ and producer Privacy is a more recent arrival to the scene who has caught many ears already. Two EPs for Lobster Theremin sandwiched around one for Klasse Wrecks between 2014-’15 showed Privacy could make house and techno as well, but his electro cuts often had the most energy and detail. A recent collab with Sync 24 for Cultivated Electronics solidified his electro bonafides, but some of his most party-starting material resides on the Zero Value EP on Klakson, in particular "U Can Tell." From the diverse and compelling music he’s made so far one gets the sense we’ll be hearing a lot more from him for years to come.', 'Umwelt is no newcomer to electro, but suddenly many more people are listening to this veteran French producer. Based in Lyon, Umwelt caught the electro bug in the late ‘90s and set up the Fundata and Shelter labels to release it. In the time since his sound has leapt from classic electro to more experimental sounds, integrating drones, ambience, and IDM rhythms. But beneath it all beats an electro heart, as exhibited on records for Shipwrec, Satamile Records NYC, Minimum Syndicat, and his own New Flesh and Rave Or Die labels. I’m partial to his 2016 Days Of Dissent album, which pairs rougher textures and gloomy, droning melodies that recall Dutch electro with a twist.', 'The Finnish duo Morphology have built a sound that bonds the burning acid core of some Dutch electro with the cold but melodically rich palette of Detroit electro. Getting their start together in 2009, the pairing of Matti Turunen and Michael Diekmann have observed classic electro tropes while refining and redefining their edges. Their sci-fi rooted records have appeared on a litany of well respected labels like Abstract Forms, AC Records, Cultivated Electronics, CPU, and Semantica Records. They’ve also collaborated with Sync 24 and appeared opposite of Silicon Scally and The Exaltics, so their electro cred is unimpeachable. If I had to place bets on who will still be at the top of electro by the next electro wave, I’d wager the pile on Morphology.', 'This article was originally published on Reverb LP.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Top Gear, well known for its stock of good secondhand gear, regularly welcomed guitarists famous and not-so-famous. Keith Richards, for example, popped in occasionally and left with such choice catches as a National resonator, an old-style Rickenbacker solidbody, and a Les Paul Custom, among others.', "Bob Marley scanned the walls and took down an unusual single-cut Gibson Les Paul Special. Top Gear had bought the guitar from Dan Armstrong, an American guitar repairer resident in the UK at the time. Dan had added block fingerboard markers in place of the original dots, modified the finish, and bound the headstock. Marc Bolan had recently returned the guitar: he'd changed his mind and chopped it in for a Les Paul with humbuckers.", "Bob bought the Special and began using it for Wailers' dates in England through the rest of May '73. He would continue to play it as his prime stage and studio guitar for the rest of his career—but not without a few more modifications along the way.", 'Bob and band were back in Britain toward the end of \'73, and his Les Paul suffered an accident. Sid Bishop was the manager at Top Gear and had sold the guitar to Bob originally. "He came back in with it and said, \'Look what I\'ve done.\'" The Les Paul had fallen forward off a guitar stand and the impact had pushed the pickup selector switch back through the body, together with a fair-sized lump of wood. Sid looked at the guitar and turned to its owner. "I said, \'Oh, you silly boy, Bob.\'"', 'Mark Moffatt also worked at Top Gear at the time, and he says Bob was lucky the headstock hadn\'t snapped. "That\'s usually the first thing to go in a fall like that. He told us he couldn\'t leave the guitar as they had shows," Mark recalls, "so could we do anything to get him going?"', 'Bob was shown to the back room at Top Gear, where Roger Giffin worked on repairs. Stan Smith was a sales assistant, but sometimes he helped Roger. "Bob appeared at the door of the repairs room," Stan remembers. "He was quite distressed at the damage to his guitar, but Roger and I suggested putting in a larger plate on the guitar front and a thinner washer on the inside, and that hopefully we\'d have enough room to reinstall the securing ring and all would again be well."', 'Bob liked the idea. "We cut a large circle from a spare piece of thick cream plastic from a Les Paul Standard scratchplate and drilled a hole in it," Stan says. "I suppose we used a scrap piece to secure the inside. So, we reinstalled the switch and then tested the guitar to make sure everything was working. I was briefly aware that here I was, sitting playing Bob\'s guitar—with him standing next to me. But he really was a thoroughly nice man."', 'Sid recalls giving the guitar back to its owner. "I said, \'Here you are—and you won\'t do that again.\' Bob was over the moon." This supposedly temporary repair, visible as a switch plate distinctively larger than normal, stayed in place for the next few years, and at some point a Tune-o-matic bridge and tailpiece were added in place of the guitar\'s original one-piece wrapover bridge. Bob Marley & The Wailers moved on to greater success, and the Special continued to serve Bob well in its role as his main electric instrument.', "Cut forward to the spring of 1978, and Roger Mayer flew from his home in England to Jamaica to meet Bob Marley. Roger is best known for his work with Jimi Hendrix, famously making effects pedals such as the Octavia that Jimi used so well. Roger's trip to meet Bob, around the time of the One Love concert in April 1978, came through a connection with the new guitarist in The Wailers, Junior Marvin, who Roger had been working with on solo material.", 'Roger asked Bob what he\'d like him to do. "He told me how much he liked Jimi Hendrix," Roger recalls, "and then he said: \'Can you help make me sound international?\' I said sure." What did he mean by that? "Everyone could see the band\'s potential. But they didn\'t have an international sound—it wasn\'t going to travel. It was always going to sound like a very good raggedy-arse Caribbean band, you know? I told them, basically, that their instruments were out of tune."', "Roger's first job, therefore, was to examine all the guitars and give them necessary overhauls and proper setups. Storage in Jamaica's humidity and regular gigging had certainly not improved the state of The Wailers' instruments. Roger says he first worked on Bob's Les Paul, renewing the tuners and some of the pots, checking the neck relief and bridge intonation, giving the guitar a thorough refret, and generally correcting and enhancing its playability.", '"That all improved Bob\'s guitar\'s sustain and kept it perfectly in tune," Roger remembers. "I did the same for the rest of their guitars, and I told them to use an electronic tuner, with everyone tuning to one tuner. So for the first time, at One Love, the band sounded in tune. The guys were coming up to Bob afterwards saying they couldn\'t believe the difference in the way the band sounded, that they\'d never heard him sound so good."', 'Later in \'78, Bob asked Roger if he could make something for his Les Paul that no one else had, so that anyone looking at it would know this was Bob Marley\'s guitar. Roger came up with a new toggle-switch plate to replace the "temporary" repair done at Top Gear some five years earlier. "I suggested an elliptical hard-anodized aluminum plate under the switch, which would be like a third eye looking out from the guitar," Roger says. It was certainly different.', 'Bob liked that idea. "So I kept the position but modified the plate," Roger concludes, "which also made it much sturdier. And also it improved the shielding slightly, too, having that extra bit of ally around it." Roger added a matching aluminum pickguard to replace the original, and the new look was in place, fulfilling the request for an instantly identifiable guitar. The Les Paul Special would stay this way until Bob\'s untimely death three years later.', 'When Gibson\'s Custom Shop announced a limited edition of a Bob Marley Les Paul Special in 2002, the press release said it was created through "painstaking research and detailing using Bob\'s original Les Paul Special." Pat Foley was Gibson\'s Entertainment Relations director at the time, and he went to Jamaica to check out that original guitar. Pat was the right man for the job, a Marley fan who had first visited Jamaica as a curious teenager and who later spent five years living on the Caribbean island of Montserrat.', 'The trip began well and got better. "Rita Marley had her assistant come meet me at the airport," Pat remembers, "and it was crazy, because when Rita Marley\'s waiting for you, they just skip customs. \'I\'m here to see Rita.\' Ah—and you just walk through. We had a great week there. Rita took us to what is now the Bob Marley museum, a big old house that Bob had lived in, with the museum actually out back. So I went out to look it over."', "There in the centre of the room was the star exhibit in what looked like a glass case. The road-weary Special was complete with its non-standard headstock binding, aluminum body plates, and block markers, and Pat got ready to take photos and make diagrams and templates of all its peculiarities and wear, ready to take back to Gibson's Custom Shop team. First, though, he needed to get at the guitar.", '"Rita came back in as I\'m looking at the guitar in its case," Pat recalls. "I said, \'Can I get access to it?\' She said of course and that she\'d get someone to come open it up for me. So I\'m thinking a guy\'s gonna come out with a key and stuff. But the guy walks over and just lifts this Plexiglas cover off—just lifts it up, sets it down, and hands me the guitar. I must have showed my surprise, because Rita says, \'Oh, I don\'t think anybody would take it.\' Well, you know, I don\'t think that people realize sometimes the value of these things. They just see it as a tool or something. The intrinsic value of Bob\'s guitar as simply a very modified Les Paul Special wouldn\'t be all that great, because it\'s an oddball. But it\'s Bob Marley\'s Les Paul Special. Which changes everything."', "Back at the Custom Shop, work began on the limited edition of 200 replicas, first sold in 2002 and featuring a Cherry Aged finish by Tom Murphy and incorporating all the modified oddities and years of wear recorded by Pat. Each one came with a wall-hanging display case that had a Gibson logo, Bob's signature, and a Lion of Judah motif, apparently indicating that this object was aimed at Marley fans rather than, say, budding reggae guitarists.", 'Despite a widespread rumor that the original guitar was buried with Bob, the only Les Paul Special that he owned has long resided in the museum in Jamaica. One rare absence came in 2011 upon the 30th anniversary of his death. The Grammy Museum in Los Angeles managed to secure the instrument as an important part of its "Bob Marley, Messenger" exhibition, and his son Ziggy Marley was on hand to endorse the event. "There is some remnant of his energy in that guitar that will always be there," Ziggy told the Los Angeles Daily News as he looked at the Les Paul on display. "I\'d love to hear the guitar\'s stories."', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

Shortly after his arrival, Life magazine called him the "greatest master of melodrama in screen history." Always an innovator, he had directed the first British talkie, Blackmail, a decade earlier. From the start, Hitchcock took a keen interest in the music in his films—and, indeed, musical motifs featured in the plotlines of two of his biggest \'30s successes, The 39 Steps (1935) and The Lady Vanishes (1938). These three strands—melodrama, sound innovation, and music—converged in the director\'s first Hollywood movie, Rebecca (1940).', "Rebecca was based on a 1938 novel by Daphne du Maurier, and its plot posed a conundrum to Franz Waxman, the composer hired to score the film. A woman marries a widower, Maxim de Winter, and goes to live in his country estate. There, the memory of the first Mrs. de Winter, the titular Rebecca, pervades all. She is the dominant character, yet she never appears, an invisible fixed point around which the story revolves. Her character and history can only be revealed through the speech and actions of other characters—and Waxman's music.", 'The composer answered this challenge by creating a "ghost orchestra" including a Hammond organ and two Hammond Novachords.', "The Novachord was the first polyphonic electronic keyboard instrument, in limited production from 1939 to 1942. Though complex, bulky, and expensive, it was briefly popular with film composers, and its shimmering vibrato was ideal for Waxman's purposes. Conventional orchestral instrumentation accompanied the actions of the living characters, but whenever the first Mrs. de Winter is mentioned, Waxman deployed the eerie, hovering tones of his ghost orchestra to summon her presence.", "Rebecca was a critical and commercial success, winning Oscars for Best Picture and Best Black-and-White Cinematography and earning nine further nominations, including one for Waxman's score. Five years later, the score to another Hitchcock film went one better and won the Oscar. This, too, featured an electronic instrument.", "Miklós Rózsa was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1907. His mother, a classical pianist, passed on to her son a love of music. Rózsa was set on becoming a composer, and he studied in Germany, then spent most of the '30s in Paris and London, composing classical music and writing film scores. In 1940, he moved to the US and began working in Hollywood.", "Hitchcock and his producer, David O. Selznick, were impressed with Rózsa's score for Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity (1944) and approached him about their new movie, Spellbound. The story focuses on Dr. Constance Petersen (played by Ingrid Bergman), a psychoanalyst at a mental hospital, and her boss, Dr. Anthony Edwardes (Gregory Peck). Petersen notices that Edwardes, who we discover is suffering from amnesia, has a phobia about sets of parallel lines against a white background.", 'Rózsa met Hitchcock and Selznick just twice. At the first meeting, Hitchcock made his demands: an expansive orchestral love theme for scenes involving the two leads, and a "new color" for the Edwardes character\'s recurring episodes of terror brought on by the phobia. Rózsa immediately suggested a Theremin for the phobia theme. Hitchcock and Selznick had never heard of it but agreed to let the composer try.', 'In his later autobiography, Double Life, Rózsa recounted how he had attempted to use electronic instruments on two previous occasions, with no success.', "He had come across the Ondes Martenot and its inventor, Maurice Martenot, when living in Paris in the '30s. He wanted to use the instrument for the Thief Of Baghdad score, which he began in 1939, by which time he was living in London. He wrote to Martenot in Paris and asked if the inventor could bring an instrument to London. However, by the time it came to the recording sessions, in early 1940, Martenot had been called up to the armed forces, so Rózsa had to abandon his idea.", 'Then, when director Henry Hathaway asked for an "eerie, uncanny" sound to evoke a premonition of death in the war film Sundown (1941), Rózsa proposed a Theremin, although in the end he resorted to a musical saw. The third time he tried to use an electronic instrument, however, he got his way.', 'Rózsa duly composed the love and phobia themes for Spellbound, and at the second and final meeting with Hitchcock and Selznick he presented both, singing the Theremin part to piano accompaniment. The director and producer both liked the tune, but they wanted to hear the instrument it would be played on.', "Rózsa's first choice for the job was the virtuoso Thereminist Clara Rockmore, but when she declined, he consulted the musicians' union directory in Hollywood, finding just one other Thereminist listed who could read music, one Samuel Hoffman.", "Trading as Hal Hope, Hoffman had led an electronic trio playing the clubs and restaurants in New York City in the '30s, developing a modest local reputation. In 1941, Hoffman moved to Los Angeles, where he set up as a podiatrist. He considered himself a retired musician but registered with the local union on the off chance that he might pick up some work. This opened up an unexpected second career for Hoffman, who became Hollywood's go-to Theremin guy right into the '60s.", "Rózsa made contact and arrived at Hoffman's house with a sketch of the Spellbound Theremin part. Hoffman sight-read and performed the part perfectly, and Rózsa hired him on the spot. Hitchcock and Selznick wanted to know how the Theremin would sound in context and suggested a trial recording of the theme with an orchestra.", "Rózsa and Hoffman obliged, and a few days later Rózsa received a memo from one of Selznick's secretaries saying that he and Hitchcock approved of the Theremin and wanted it in every scene connected with mental disturbance, and also in the title sequence. According to Rózsa, this was followed by many more memos from Selznick containing instructions about how the Theremin should be used—which Rózsa ignored. Eventually, though, the score was recorded and approved.", "Rózsa's Spellbound music won the 1945 Oscar for Best Original Score. The main love theme is classic romantic Hollywood. In contrast, the Theremin is the sound of distress and appears in all scenes featuring Edwardes's parallel-lines phobia, as well as a surreal dream sequence designed by Salvador Dalí.", "After Spellbound, Rózsa worked again for Billy Wilder. The Lost Weekend (1945) follows Don Birnam (played by Ray Milland) on a weekend binge that culminates with delirium tremens and nightmarish hallucinations. The composer used Hoffman's Theremin again, to the chagrin of Selznick, who considered it something of a trademark for Spellbound. But he couldn't stop Rózsa from using the instrument, and the score for The Lost Weekend was nominated alongside Spellbound in the '45 Oscars.", "It was nearly 20 years before another Hitchcock film used electronic sound, in The Birds (1963). This, too, is a du Maurier adaptation, based on a short story of the same title. In the intervening years, the director had formed a working relationship with Bernard Herrmann, the composer with whom he is now most closely associated. Herrmann worked on The Birds, though he didn't consider the score to be music at all.", 'The movie features a classic Hitchcock device—the twisting of the familiar into something sinister. In this case, flocks of birds begin to attack humans. Normally harmless creatures become objects of terror, not by changes to their appearance, but by their unexplained violence. Hitchcock realized that vicious bird attacks could not be soundtracked by recordings of birdsong and tweets, and he decided against a conventional musical score. Instead, he turned to an obscure German electronic instrument called the Mixtur-Trautonium.', "Friedrich Trautwein invented the Trautonium, and his first iterations did away with a keyboard in favor of a resistor wire over a metal plate, which the performer presses to create a sound. Telefunken produced these early instruments from 1933 until 1935, making 200, though few were ever sold. Trautwein's assistant, Oskar Sala, further developed the instrument into the twin-manual Mixtur-Trautonium, a more sophisticated version of the original, which retained the wire-and-plate playing action.", 'In April 1962, as Hitchcock and Herrmann were wondering what to do about the soundtrack for The Birds, the director received a letter from a German composer, Remi Gassmann—who worked with Sala—promoting the Mixtur-Trautonium. Later, he told author Steven C. Smith of its capacity to make "familiar sounds" and "an almost limitless supply of completely unfamiliar sounds."', 'Hitchcock recalled he had heard an early incarnation of the instrument on Berlin radio in the late \'20s. In December 1962, he and Herrmann travelled to Berlin to meet Gassmann and Sala and hear the Mixtur-Trautonium. It is this peculiar device that generates almost the entire soundtrack of The Birds. Sala, along with Gassmann, was credited with "electronic sound production and composition" and Herrmann as "sound consultant."', 'The Birds soundtrack was more sound design than music, consisting of organized, stylized noise designed to evoke, rather than mimic, the sound of hundreds of seagulls and crows pecking humans to death. From layered cacophonous squawks to ominous subliminal drones, it adds a unique dimension to a strange film.', 'Sala continued to develop the Mixtur-Trautonium and hone his performing technique. He tended to work alone and had no pupils. Consequently the Mixtur-Trautonium—in contrast to other early electronic instruments like the Theremin and the Ondes Martenot—did not attract a nucleus of enthusiasts to sustain and develop it. When Sala died in 2002, his knowledge died with him, and today the Mixtur-Trautonium is rarely used. As for Hitchcock, after The Birds he never returned to electronic music. Many critics consider it his last great film.', 'About the author: Mark Brend is an author and a musician.

Is it a scene from the next Avengers movie?', "No, it's just an ad for the Wasp synthesizer, a characteristically quirky product of late-'70s/early-'80s UK upstarts Electronic Dream Plant (EDP), mavericks who empowered countless post-punk and synth-pop bands by going against the grain with their offbeat equipment.", "EDP made cheap, plastic instruments that were anything but toys. And the bug-themed branding that encompassed everything from their advertisements to their nomenclature (Wasp, Gnat, Spider, Caterpillar) was the least of the company's idiosyncrasies.", "Formed in 1977 during the heyday of punk, EDP seemed to embrace the era's scrappy, DIY ethic. They subverted both technological and corporate conventions to make instruments targeted to working-class musicians, with a plan to put synth power in the hands of the people.", "The company was founded by the odd couple of Adrian Wagner and Chris Huggett. The great-great grandson of legendary composer Richard Wagner, Adrian was a headstrong electronic musician who'd already released several albums that ranged from Tangerine Dream-like cosmic excursions to tracks that seemed to predict the New Wave years in advance. Huggett was a visionary boffin who'd been working with tape machines as an engineer/technician for 3M.", 'They met when Wagner was working on a project with 3M. Wagner shared with Huggett his idea of building an inexpensive mass-market synthesizer.', 'At this point, there were still relatively few synth manufacturers, and even the cheapest monophonic instruments were beyond most blue-collar budgets, especially for young people.', "In the studio, synths were exotic beasts that required the assistance of outside programmers. In performance, they were unwieldy, sometimes unstable, and far too costly and delicate to be banged around in the back of your big brother's cargo van.", 'Anthony Harrison-Griffin, an engineer who would become a key element in the EDP mix a bit later, picks up the story. "That [idea] burned away at Chris for quite a while. And then Chris phoned Adrian back up and said, \'I think I\'ve got something for you.\'" Huggett\'s eureka moment came in the form of using integrated circuits for what would become the Wasp.', '"Chris used integrated digital electronics where fundamentally other systems were analog," explains Harrison-Griffin. "If you look at the circuit board on a Wasp, it\'s got chips everywhere. They\'re all integrated chips which are generating digital signals. That allowed him to put that through digital oscillators. That was really a game changer. Nobody had really grasped integrated digital circuitry in the way that Chris had for this type of product."', 'That and cost considerations led to the creation of a flat, touch-sensitive panel with a keyboard graphic overlaid in lieu of actual keys. It was partly inspired by the similar touchpad found on the Stylophone (most famously heard on David Bowie\'s "Space Oddity"). The ability to slide straight across the "keyboard" created possibilities unavailable on most other synths.', 'That wasn\'t the only revolutionary aspect of the Wasp\'s circuitry. "There wasn\'t enough room on the circuit board," explains Harrison-Griffin, "so double-sided circuit boards had to be used. It was used in computers but I think the double-sided circuit board had never been used in a synthesizer at that stage."', 'True to the renegade spirit that would define EDP, there was nothing formal about the birth of the Wasp. "It wasn\'t \'designed,\' says Harrison-Griffin, "it just literally came out of a series of conversations. It was all designed on the back of a fag [cigarette] packet, really. No drawings, nothing! \'We\'ll just plug it in there.\' The only drawing that was ever done was Chris\'s of the circuitry."', 'Huggett used his engineering skills to create the planform, while Wagner determined the layout. They gave the simple, monophonic Wasp two digital oscillators, analog envelope and filter controls, and a sturdy but relatively lightweight plastic housing with a black-and-yellow color scheme befitting its namesake.', '"The key part was the price," says Harrison-Griffin. "Adrian really wanted to hit the £200 mark." Since the most affordable alternative at that time would have been something like an ARP Odyssey, which he reckons went for £700-800 back then, the impact would be enormous.', 'The Wasp met the world in 1978, hitting all the marks Wagner and Huggett had laid out for it—affordability, mobility (it even had a built-in speaker if you wanted to use it sans amplifier), and reliability. The digital oscillators helped greatly with that last one, says Harrison-Griffin. "The nightmare of the analog system was that you had to tune it every half hour. Whereas once you\'ve got this thing in digital format that was it. It\'s made up of zeros and ones and it\'s either on or it\'s off."', "But just as Wagner had presumed, the Wasp's biggest selling point was the price. Budget-bound musicians hungry to make electronic sounds ran towards the instrument as if they were magnetized and its hull was steel instead of plastic.", 'In an interview with Red Bull Music Academy, synth-pop pioneer Thomas Leer remembered, "I was looking at ARP Odysseys and Minimoogs, but I was broke, so the Wasp was the only option for me... The sound was instant and powerful, they had it hooked up to a Peavey amp, and it just blasted through the shop. I was like, \'This is the one for me!\', and bought it on the spot."', 'The synth lines on Leer\'s milestone 1979 debut LP, The Bridge, were all done on the Wasp. "The Wasp was like a punk rock synthesizer," he says, "because it was cheap and nasty and it did the job—and that allowed people who couldn\'t afford a Korg or whatever to get on with it."', 'In the same story, Chris Carter of post-punk/industrial innovators Throbbing Gristle recalled, "It was pretty different to most keyboard synths on the market. The plastic case, the keyboard and the size had echoes of the EMS Synthi AKS keyboard, but the color scheme and the layout were very different. Then I saw the low price and high specification, and realized this little synth was going to be a serious game-changer for a lot of struggling electronic musicians."', 'Another 1979 debut album featuring the Wasp as its only synth was Product Perfect by post-punk outfit Fashion (aka Fàshiön Music). Frontman Luke James recalls:', '"The Wasp was really the first affordable synth available in Birmingham music shops in 1978. I remember [Fashion bassist/keyboardist John] Mulligan got one of the first ones. Soon after, Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran got one. Fàshiön were a big influence on the formation of Duran Duran... with Mulligan and Nick comparing and sharing sounds they came up with on their Wasps. For what it was it had a remarkable range of sounds and possibilities. It definitely helped shape Fàshiön\'s sound."', 'The Wasp was the first instrument Rhodes ever purchased. Many years later, he enthused in Keyboard Magazine, "It doesn\'t sound like anything else. It really does have a unique character to it."', 'In between the end of Dave Stewart and Annie Lennox\'s band The Tourists and the start of Eurythmics, Stewart found inspiration for the first flowerings of the latter by working with the Wasp. "I could actually get some interesting things happening," he told Sound on Sound, "sequenced little sort of random hold patterns that sounded very exciting to us, even though it was just coming out of the plastic speaker."', 'The instrument\'s sphere of influence even extended to the other side of the pond. Devo\'s Gerald Casale told Tape Op, "We loved the sound of the Wasp and we were so excited about the Wasp that, in a suicide move, we used them onstage during the Duty Now for the Future tour. As soon as any drip of sweat from my head or hands hit this thing, it\'d go "Bleewwwdawablawdwa!" I wouldn\'t be touching it, and it would be playing."', 'The Wasp made EDP unexpected players in the synth scene. But in January 1980, the arrival of an enthusiastic industrial design student would soon find the company doubling down on its mission of making synths everybody could afford.', "Anthony Harrison-Griffin was a proud Wasp owner in his second year studying product design at London's Central School of Art & Design when he contacted Wagner about completing his degree by embedding himself at EDP and writing a painstakingly detailed report on the construction of the Wasp. All the company's operations were out of the Red Gables house in Oxford where Wagner lived and had his recording studio.", '"I headed off into the Oxfordshire countryside to this strange, sort of \'50s house in the middle of nowhere," Harrison-Griffin remembers. "EDP was certainly a fairly hedonistic place by the time I walked in the door. There was lots of drugs and rock \'n\' roll at the time and that\'s what was going on. It was a fairly crazy place. The whole of the ground floor was basically the production of EDP with the studio. The upstairs of Red Gables was just living accommodation. That was where Adrian and Kathy, his wife, lived. There were very blurred edges between what went on in EDP\'s business world and what went on in the private world."', 'The new kid quickly went from spectator to participant, drafted into the team tasked with creating an even more stripped-down synth that could sell for half the price of the Wasp. In keeping with EDP\'s buggy branding it would be known as the Gnat. "I built a prototype of the Gnat once I\'d designed it," recalls Harrison-Griffin. "Adrian took it to the banks in London to gain the finances to actually invest in the tooling to make it."', 'He remembers getting a classic good news/bad news call from Wagner. "He said, \'Well we\'ve got the funding!\' He said, \'We haven\'t got quite as much funding as we wanted.\' [I asked], \'So is that the bad news?\' He said, \'No. The bad news is I\'ve dropped your prototype on the [train] platform and it\'s in bits.\'"', 'Even while stripping things down, Harrison-Griffin tried to craft a more tactile keyboard for the Gnat. "I came up with a design they fell in love with," he explains, "to turn it more three-dimensional. Instead of the keyboard just being a cut-out area, it actually has a front edge. It emulates a little bit of a normal keyboard." The Gnat had one oscillator to the Wasp\'s two, so it was slightly smaller, and the filter was digital instead of analog. "it doesn\'t even have an on/off button," says Harrison-Griffin. "There\'s no volume control either. It was stripped to the bare basics."', 'Retailing for just under £100 when it hit the market in 1981, the Gnat generated an even bigger buzz than its older sibling. "As soon as the Gnat came out people suddenly thought, \'I don\'t need to wait for a Wasp.\' We had an immediate problem… we just couldn\'t make it fast enough. You plug a Gnat into a decent amp and you get some phenomenal stuff out of it. Some of the low-end stuff is phenomenal, it reminds me a little bit of the Minimoog Model D. Some of the filters on there are exceptionally good."', "The Wasp and the Gnat were the major pegs on which EDP hung its hat, but during the company's brief, bold run, other ideas were realized that expanded the capabilities of those instruments.", 'In between the arrival of the Wasp and the birth of the Gnat, Electronic Dream Plant premiered the Spider, a simple but surprisingly effective sequencer to be used in tandem with the Wasp. "You put those things together and you\'ve got some marvelous capabilities straight away," enthuses Harrison-Griffin. "The Spider literally was like taking the casing of the Wasp and slicing a bit off it, so they sit beautifully next to each other. It\'s pretty seamless."', 'The Caterpillar was designed for those who couldn\'t deal with a touchpad and demanded a real-deal keyboard. MIDI technology was years away but the Caterpillar functioned similarly to a MIDI keyboard controller. "That was a game changer because it allowed you to plug four Wasps into one keyboard," says Harrison-Griffin, "which allowed you to have polyphony for a fraction of the price. Each Wasp had two-key capability, so you have four Wasps, you\'ve got an eight-key capability. That was pretty mind-blowing at the time for the money."', 'For those accustomed to conventional keys there was also the Wasp Deluxe, the closest EDP ever came to a conventional keyboard synth. It was basically a tricked-out Wasp with wooden housing and a real, three-octave keyboard.', 'After Huggett and Wagner parted ways (more on that in a minute), Wagner put out a couple of last-gasp Wasp and Gnat Specials, sort of a half-step between the original synths and the Deluxe treatment, with a wooden case but a touchpad keyboard. "They were never very successful," says Harrison-Griffin. "I think Adrian decided to produce them in these ways and string it out a bit."', 'After a couple of years of Wasps and Gnats flying around, Wagner and Huggett found themselves at cross purposes. "Chris wanted to move the business away from the image," Harrison-Griffin explains, "he never really liked the look of the Wasp or the Gnat. He then had meetings with Adrian along the lines of, \'Can we do something completely different in parallel? We\'ll carry on doing Wasps and Gnats and Spiders and all of those. In tandem to that can we develop other stuff that is more professional-looking?\' I think Adrian just flatly refused. All he wanted to do was expand the business they currently had. It just got more argumentative."', 'In 1982 the conflicts came to a head as Wagner and Huggett divided up the company between them. "Adrian didn\'t then actually honor dissolving EDP," remembers Harrison-Griffin, "he carried on trading as EDP until his [manufacturing] stock was out. He did some of these emulations [e.g. the Specials] with the idea that it would perhaps produce more revenue with the bits that he had available."', 'Freed from the insect realm, Huggett started fresh by founding the Oxford Synthesiser Company. Though the venture was short-lived, its one product deserves a story of its own. With the aid of Harrison-Griffin, he created the OSCar, a mono synth that debuted in 1983 with two oscillators and a unique, rubbery element that both acted as a protective cushion and gave the instrument an unprecedented profile.', '"By the time we got together on the OSCar we had really debugged the issues that were problems on the Gnat and the Wasp," says Harrison-Griffin. I was responsible for a fairly avant-garde look which is a love/hate situation. I approached it from the point of view of practicality, that literally you could take this thing and throw it in the back of your touring van and you wouldn\'t have to put it in a flight case. I spoke a lot with Billy Currie of Ultravox, who took it on tour for about nine months and it came back pretty much as it left, which was pretty impressive."', 'One of the most remarkable aspects of the OSCar was its MIDI capability, rare at the time except on the most expensive synths. The OSCar was ultimately embraced by everybody from Keith Emerson to Stevie Wonder.', 'The instrument was built in Huggett\'s home workspace, remembered by Harrison-Griffin as a gloriously geeky sort of hobbit den. "You climbed through a really small hole to get into it, and there\'s benches all the way down and no natural light. That was his heaven. It was like he was cocooned in this world. He climbed through this hole and transcended into a different place."', "Not long after the OSCar's arrival, Huggett went to work for Novation, where he'd remain until his death in October 2020. Wagner passed away two years earlier. But the instruments they designed never lost their appeal or their influence.", 'Today you can find reboots like a modular version of the Wasp and a software version of the OSCar by other companies. But Electronic Dream Plant obsessives still search for exceedingly rare vintage Wasps and Gnats to incorporate into their work.', 'As collectors\' items, the old EDP instruments are no longer for budget-minded newbies. But they still look and sound like nothing else. "It was the clashing of those two minds, Adrian and Chris, that made this all happen," says Harrison-Griffin. Lamenting Huggett\'s passing, the iconic composer Hans Zimmer called him "A hugely influential designer." Phil Hartnoll of Orbital declared Huggett "a bit of a British synth hero to us in the know."', "The dreams made real decades ago by the EDP crew seem impossible to forget. And that's probably just the way Huggett and Wagner would have wanted it.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Soon enough, those instruments will be antiques, which, unlike "vintage," does have a strict definition: any item 100 years of age or older.', 'On Reverb, we generally refer to anything made prior to 1980 as being vintage, but even that delineation, like an old photograph, is starting to yellow and curl around its edges.', 'Indeed, anything around 30 years or older can be considered vintage, so we thought it would be fun to look at the gear turning 30 this year.', "What started as a fun exercise has been an enlightening adventure through the gear world of the early '90s, when digital recording was still on the come-up and the music-making landscape was shifting uneasily between eras.", "Yes, that's right. The DAW whose name would become shorthand for the new era of recording is now vintage, having made its official debut in 1991.", "A few years before, Digidesign had created Sound Tools, a stereo audio recording software that allowed users to record two tracks of audio onto an Apple Macintosh hard drive. While that was impressive enough for its time, Pro Tools was the company's next-level option, allowing multitrack recording and playback of four channels through one of a Mac II's NuBus expansion slots. Soon, additional sound cards were available for purchase that could grow the system—four channels at a time—for a total of 16 available tracks.", 'Pro Tools was not the first direct-to-hard-drive multi-track recorder, but because it used a consumer computer brand, it was the most affordable option. Thanks to the price and key updates in the following years, Pro Tools managed to attract and grow a loyal user base, and of course would become dominant in the industry over time.', 'The first fully in-the-box hit—Ricky Martin\'s "Livin\' La Vida Loca"—wouldn\'t arrive until 1999, and by then Pro Tools\' track counts and capabilities had grown significantly. But in 1991, the tides were beginning to shift.', 'What\'s funny, looking back at that first "affordable" system, is that it cost well over $10,000 USD (in 1990s\' money): Pro Tools\' essential software and hardware components cost about $6,000, additional accelerator cards and audio interfaces were several-thousand dollars apiece, and a Mac II itself would set you back more than $5,000.', "With such limitations of computer-based recording, one can see why other digital recording options were still the norm in the early '90s.", "Throughout the previous decade, innovative (and very expensive) digital recorders—like Mitsubishi's X-80 and X-800 or Sony's 24-track PCM-3324—could be found in digitally minded professional studios, mobile recording trucks, and personal sound lairs of stars like Stevie Wonder and Frank Zappa.", "Instead of recording to a hard drive, these machines recorded onto specially designed digital reel-to-reel tapes. But while they offered high track counts and flexibility, they did so at great cost. The X-80 was the entry-level recorder at about $25,000, while Sony's PCM-3324 cost $150,000.", 'Within that landscape, Alesis announced its Alesis Digital Audio Tape (ADAT) digital multi-track recorder at NAMM in January 1991. By encoding digital audio onto consumer-level S-VHS video cassettes, the ADAT machine offered home recordists and project studios a foot into the high-track-count future.', "ADAT recorders could fit eight audio tracks onto one S-VHS tape (not to be confused with the era's DAT recorders, which used smaller digital cassettes). But by connecting multiple ADAT units together, it was possible to build 16-track, 24-track, or larger recording rigs.", "Even though ADAT recorders debuted at $3,995 apiece, when compared to six-figure alternatives, they were a democratizing phenomenon. And if you want to try your hand at some retro ADAT recording today, they'll only cost you about a hundred bucks on the vintage market.", "Roger Linn and Akai's very first MPC, the MPC60, was released in 1988, just a few years after Linn's own company (which made the LM-1, LM-2 LinnDrum, and Linn9000) went under.", "You need only look at those previous drum machines to realize what a gamechanger the MPC was, not just in sonics or function, but in instrument design. The wide array of 16-pad controllers and portable, all-in-one beatmaking workstations available today still hew closely to the MPC's layout. The LinnDrum's slim, clacking rows of calculator-like buttons? Not so much.", "The MPC60II, released in 1991, was mostly the same instrument internally with some cosmetic and layout adjustments, the first next iteration of a design that's been remade in numerous ways ever since—whether by Akai and Linn, Akai without Linn, or any number of imitative companies.", "In the same way the Stratocaster's design lives on in innumerable new guitars each year, the MPC's does as well. And just like those earliest Strats, the earliest MPCs are now vintage instruments too.", "For as much as electronic musicians lean into futurism, there's also a fair amount of nostalgia, as evidenced by the current market for reissued analog classics, soft-synth emulations of the same, and even, in a way, the spread of Eurorack itself, with its reclamation of self-made patches and hands-on experimentation.", "The Roland JD-800 can't be confused for analog. It's a digital space station whose sounds and power have endured, keeping up its prices on the used market even as trends have shifted in myriad directions.", "But what stands out is that—upon its release in 1991—part of its appeal was that it gave users a more analog-style of control over its sounds, inviting them to ditch the presets of other keyboards like the D-50 or Yamaha's DX7 and get back to sound design. As scanned and shared in the mu:zines online archive, Julian Colbeck's 1991 review in Sound on Sound captured the allure:", 'When I first started reviewing synths back in the late \'70s I remember chortling away with my fellow scribes about the differences in perception of their instruments between guitarists and keyboard players. "Imagine anyone getting all misty-eyed about a MiniMoog or a Jupiter 8!" we\'d laugh. Of course, that is precisely what happened. Now, as we all stare obliquely at our monitors or, in a rare moment of tweaking, prod thoughtfully at our instruments\' Inc/Dec buttons, the older ones amongst us do spare kindly thoughts for the old days when records were made by musicians, and control panels of synthesizers came smothered in exciting-looking sliders, knobs and switches.', 'That gibe about "when records were made by musicians" is now pretty dated too, but the passage still reflects what set the JD-800 apart. Because it "cried out to be programmed," the JD-800 harkened back to a previous time of vintage synth design. And now, with time continuing apace, we are misty-eyed about the JD-800.', "Eddie Van Halen's Wolfgang is one of the world's most recognizable signature guitars, and it has more than a few interesting twists and turns to its backstory.", 'For starters, it ended up being made by three different brands, which we\'ve covered before in our "Wolfgang Saga." But it also began its life without a name, going simply by "Eddie Van Halen Signature," which was unofficially shortened to EVH, before it adopted the "Wolfgang" moniker.', 'First released in 1991 by Ernie Ball Music Man, Eddie\'s high-performance signature was the result of close collaboration. As he said in an ad at the time, "I endorsed the guitar I used to play. I designed this one... Big difference."', 'For as striking as the final look of the guitar turned out, it was built with a clear mandate: few frills, no unnecessary features, and one well-placed joke. The single knob, a volume knob, is mislabeled "Tone."', 'It was a new era of playing for Eddie. The Sammy Hagar–helmed Van Halen had an unexpected hit in the form of "Right Now," which won Video of the Year at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards. Eddie\'s relationship with Ernie Ball Music Man didn\'t last long. They continued the model as the Axis, while Peavey got to work on the new Wolfgang, with that enduring name attached.', "One last interesting fold when thinking of vintage gear and the early 1990s is that the vintage guitar market then just wasn't what it is today.", "Sure, you had aficionados of '50s and '60s Teles and Les Pauls, but it was still a time that bands like Sonic Youth or Nirvana could find also-ran Fenders—'60s Jazzmasters, Jaguars, and Mustangs—in pawn shops. Of course, we don't consider those offsets also-rans today, and if by some wild chance you found one for a few hundred dollars, you might as well have found a pot of gold.", 'So back in the late \'80s and early \'90s, when Jerry Jones started to build guitars based off of classic Danelectro designs, it was seen as a novelty. Writing from the 1991 Winter NAMM show, the Los Angeles Times\' Jim Washburn said that there were so many "state-of-the-art" superstrats "that they were nearly impossible to tell apart."', 'By contrast, Jones explained the appeal of his guitars to Washburn:', '"I think it’s because, despite the great number of companies making instruments, there aren’t that many different types to choose from; everybody is making variations of the same things," Jones said, "I think this is a backlash, and a return to an earthier, more dimensional sound. And we’re basically selling fun. You can’t imagine the number of people who walk by and do a double take and smile ear to ear when they see these things."', 'Washburn dubbed it the "Silvertone-ization" of the market, a decidedly \'60s bent beginning to catch on with players like Los Lobos, Leo Kottke, and Jimmie Vaughan. Today, such retro rebrands are just one of many vintage-styled corners of the new gear market. At more than 30 years later, perhaps we\'ll see a vintage turducken: Some new builder making clones of Jerry Jones\' Danelectros.', 'Certainly there were more than six pieces of gear released in 1991, and plenty more would be worth including in this article: from Roland\'s first SPD to the many rack effects units still proliferating at the time. Have your own thoughts on the gear turning "vintage" this year?

You happily oblige, grab your gear and head out. When you arrive you’ll notice a few familiar sights—perhaps there’s a shelf full of records, or a stray guitar leaning on the arm of a futon. In their carved out recording space, you’ll likely find a bed, maybe some strewn laundry, but almost definitely some sort of MIDI controller and a computer. Chances are, you’ll recognize a rectangular scarlet chassis on the desk somewhere, the unmistakable framework of Focusrite’s Scarlett 2i2 USB interface.', 'Every beginner, moderate, and professional musician who has at-home recording capabilities uses an audio interface, and the vast majority of those probably own a Scarlett. In fact, Focusrite claims that the Scarlett 2i2, their highest selling model, has “already helped make more records than any other interface in history.” It’s a bold, yet doubtlessly factual statement.', 'Since the launch of the Scarlett USB interfaces in 2010, Focusrite has been at the forefront of the home and studio hardware market, and there’s no mistaking why: Scarlett interfaces are a steal for the service they provide. Focusrite preamps are some of the most prestigious and well constructed ever made. It’s literally what their entire heritage is built on.', 'But you don’t need a puff piece to wax poetic on the power of Scarlett interfaces. You probably already know that. What I’m here to tell you is that your friend’s Scarlett 2i2 on their desk boasts a lineage similar to that of a chicken or a lizard—if you trace back its history, you’ll find that its ancestors were once giants, titans of their kind, unable to be harnessed by the average pedestrian.', 'What you probably don’t know, however, is how the auspicious and formidable beginnings of Focusrite were spearheaded by two of the greatest innovators in music history, one of whom’s names is tattooed on the back of a bulk of the records sitting on your friend’s shelf.', 'Just as the unceremonious decline of The Beatles unfolded at the break of the 1970s, George Martin began expanding. The success of his proteges greatly benefitted his career as an independent record producer, and by 1970, Martin was one of the most sought-out producers in the world. It’s what led him to establish Associated Independent Recordings (AIR Studios) in 1970, Martin’s very own recording studio in central London.', 'In 1979, Martin expanded once more, establishing a new AIR Studio on the Caribbean island of Montserrat, where he hosted a number of world class acts through its tenure—a list that includes Elton John, Marvin Gaye, The Police, and The Rolling Stones. While the studio’s gear list boasted an impressive inventory, Martin dared to expand even further.', 'As Air Studios Montserrat entered its prime in 1985, Martin contracted a historic commission. Rupert Neve—the electronic engineering genius behind his quintessential Neve brand mixing, preamp, EQ, and dynamics consoles—was tasked by Martin to create a no-compromise mic preamp and EQ circuit to be installed in the studio’s mixing console (a Neve console, no less).', 'He called his creation the ISA 110, a comprehensive preamp built with a (now signature) Lundahl transformer and a Neve EQ circuit. It became the keystone product for which Neve founded his newest business venture upon, a boutique audio processor company he called Focusrite. The circuits within the preamp were meticulously designed, and each unit was sourced and outfitted with military-grade parts. It was built with the intention of it being the best preamp money could buy, and Martin loved the module so much that he had Neve outfit his entire mixing console in AIR Studios London exclusively with ISA 110s.', 'It should be noted that these original consoles were not cheap. If you were to buy a pair of ISA 110s in the late 1980s, along with the required power supply and mounting rack, they would run you upwards of $7,000 (around $22,000 today).', "Sir George Martin’s early interest in the ISA 110 series led Neve to develop several other no-compromise mic preamps, including the ISA 130 and ISA 115, which served as the building blocks for the Focusrite Forte—a full recording console, and arguably his largest and most ambitious project to date. The Forte console was the most high-end console of its time, but also the most complex and expensive to produce. In the final years of the '80s, only two Focusrite Forte consoles were ever made. One was shipped to Master Rock Studios in London; the other went to Electric Lady in New York City.", 'But with great majesty comes great expense. The Forte console was simply too costly to produce, and Focusrite was hemorrhaging money fast. Neve was left with no choice but to sell his company and move on to another venture.', 'Phil Dudderidge had recently sold his company, Soundcraft, and was left projectless and with money in the bank. He stepped in to buy the majority assets of Neve’s brainchild and assembled a team of engineers and designers to reinvigorate the stagnant Focusrite brand by reimagining and redesigning the Forte console into the Focusrite Studio console.', 'Dudderidge maintained Neve’s ISA 110 as the studio console’s primary constituent, but vowed to produce the module more cost-effectively and with a larger market in mind. Outfitted with over 70 inputs and immense processing power, the Focusrite Studio console was a colossus, a groundbreaking module that was preeminent in its class. Focusrite, under Dudderidge’s watchful eye, managed to produce 10 of the consoles by 1990, and many of them are still in use today around the world. Arguably the most recognizable of the original 10 sits in Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles, where charted hits recorded on that console have sold in excess of one billion copies.', 'It’s fair to say that the components of the Focusrite Studio console are beloved by recording engineers. Many of those who have been lucky enough to work with and study it, like analogue experts Mark Thompson and Hugh Robjohns of Funky Junk and Sound on Sound magazine respectively, praise its honest portrayal of sound and soft touch. Whereas many audio processors manipulate sound by adding or taking away certain components, the Focusrite Studio console and its ISA 110 preamps and EQ units capture sound transparently, subtly adding a slight body and texture while tastefully enhancing the colors of each frequency.', 'While exclusive and in very limited supply, the triumph of the studio console and the high demand for its features—mic pre, EQ, dynamics—led to the beginning of several highly successful ranges, like the ISA Range, the subsequent Blue Range of mastering products, and the Red Range in 1993, an award-winning line of analogue mic pres, EQs, and dynamics consoles that found great critical and commercial success through the decade, and is still being reissued today.', 'Since then, Focusrite has released numerous product lines that have gone widely commercial, including the Platinum, Saffire, Liquid, Clarrett, and of course, the Scarlett Ranges that have established Focusrite as a leader in analogue audio processors for the major consumer market.', 'Today, the Scarlett Range and its third generation product line dominate the interface market, but similar to the abundant chicken or garden lizard, its family tree branches out to a larger, more intimidating pedigree elsewhere in the modern world. Focusrite’s RedNet range of interfaces and preamps bear more similarities to the Studio Console than the Scarletts in both build and affordability. But much of the RedNet Range, like the RedNet MP8R preamp, is intended for larger capacity audio processing and live sound production.', 'Focusrite also continues to reinvent and reissue several products in the ISA Range, like the ISA 428 MKII, a mic preamp with four channels that mirrors the classic look of the ISA 110. And since acquiring Novation in 2004, Focusrite has been releasing a variety of synthesizers, keyboards, and MIDI controllers, including their own Launchpad line in 2009, further ballooning their stature as a leader in the music technology industry.', 'There’s a whole magnificent world behind the modest Scarlett 2i2 that sits on the desks of the countless thousands of home recordists worldwide. And unlike many products on the market today that took time and endless patience to prevail, Focusrite began with a cataclysmic bang, the product of two great minds with the intention of creating something entirely groundbreaking.', 'Though the beginning of the epoch was turbulent at times, the careful and clever guidance of Phil Dudderidge and his team have distilled greatness into something so humbly commonplace, you can find it nestled amongst the comforts of our own bedrooms, the culmination of a grand evolution lying in between your friend’s record shelf and the laundry basket.', 'Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that a single ISA 110 (along with a power supply and rack) would have cost $7,000 in the late 1980s.

You might see them at local gigs or at the birth of the UK’s open-air festival movement—in 1969 with the Stones in Hyde Park, or at the Isle of Wight festivals of 1968–'70. One thing they all shared was a reliance on pioneering PA equipment created by a single company, WEM. It stood for Watkins Electric Music, and it was the brainchild of Charlie Watkins, a most unlikely innovator and audio pioneer.", 'It wasn’t just British bands who liked the sound and the features of WEM PA. American artists visiting the UK also took a liking to Charlie’s gear, notably The Byrds—who played an important role in the WEM story—and Janis Joplin, who took Charlie on tour with her in the USA to oversee her own WEM PA system.', 'Prior to the birth of WEM PA, live gigs in the UK and Europe had suffered from truly dire sound. Most touring artists had to rely on house systems that hadn’t been improved since the ‘40s. When artists wanted something better, all that was on offer were mixer amps—rarely offering more than 100 watts output—driving pairs of 4x10 or 4x12 column speakers that stood at either side of the stage.', 'Charlie Watkins, who died in 2014, changed all that. He was born in 1923, and by the ‘60s he was already a successful manufacturer of amplifiers, having launched in 1954 his Watkins Westminster guitar combo, followed later by the more ambitious Dominator and then the Copicat tape echo, which was to become a legend in its own right. But PA, he told me when I interviewed him in 2010, was an entirely new venture.', '"I think it began one night when I went to see Johnny Kidd & The Pirates," Charlie recalled. "That started me going out to see what was being played, rather than just sitting in the office. And wherever I went, you couldn’t hear the singer. There was nothing but this dreadful PA at the time—no foldback monitors, just a guy with a Shure Unidyne or an old Reslo ribbon mic and a hopeless PA system." Charlie said he got his biggest laugh from the house PAs that artists often had to use. "They had these line-source systems, and they were terrible! It was usually horrible old war-surplus equipment with 12-inch hard-cone speakers in boxes spread all round the hall. I don’t know why it went on so long."', 'He remembered The Byrds coming to Britain in 1965. "They didn’t want the sort of rotten PA everyone was using. I don’t know what they’d been using in America, but it was probably as bad as it was here, and they didn’t want to bring W-bins [folded-horn cabinets originally designed in the ‘30s for cinema use] with them. So their tour promoter called me and said, ‘For £100, I’ll let you build a PA for The Byrds.’ It seemed like a good idea to me at the time—I could do with getting into the PA market."', 'Charlie’s first attempt was, he admitted, pretty awful. The band’s first gig was in Nelson, Lancashire, but Charlie couldn’t make that. "But the next morning—well, if there had been a big hole, I’d have crawled into it! David Crosby was on the phone saying, ‘Expletive-deleted rubbish!’ So I went out with them the next night to see what was wrong, and the moment they started up ‘Mr. Tambourine Man’ it was obvious they were right. You couldn’t hear a word."', 'Rather than give up, Watkins was inspired by the challenge. "I thought to myself, well, this PA thing is harder than it seems, but I want to do it even more now after all that trouble." Impressed by his willingness to work on the problem, The Byrds on a return visit in 1970 turned to WEM again and bought a system to take home with them.', 'Charlie now went to work on the problem of bad sound, coming up with the idea of chaining amps together to increase the power and finding speakers that would suit the human voice rather than an electric guitar. The result was possibly the world’s first 1,000-watt PA system, used at the 1967 National Jazz & Blues Festival, held in Windsor, to the west of London. It comprised WEM SL100 slave amps and a host of speaker cabinets with Goodmans dual-concentric-coned Axiom speakers. Artists on the bill, which included the debut of Fleetwood Mac, were astonished by the sound—as were the police, who prosecuted Watkins for sound pollution. Famously, the case was dismissed.', 'That first 1,000-watt system highlighted another problem with contemporary PA equipment—the lack of adequate mixers. Charlie’s answer was the five-channel Audiomaster, which soon became essential for touring bands, particularly when they realized you could chain two together and get the undreamed of luxury of ten channels! Check out the back cover of Pink Floyd’s 1969 album Ummagumma with the band’s WEM PA displayed as part of what by the standards of the day was a giant payload of gear.', 'Not only could singers not be heard by audiences prior to the development of WEM PA systems, but they could rarely hear themselves. Bands had begun to use columns as sidefills, but that had its limitations. Roger Chapman of Family stumbled on the answer. Frustrated by not being able to hear his own vocals, Roger had Charlie take the signal from an Audiomaster’s headphone output and feed it into its own amp and a speaker. "He always used to perform with a towel handy, because he used to sweat a lot," Charlie remembered. "So when I gave him the 1x12 monitor, he rolled up the towel, stuck it underneath, and hey presto! There it was—a wedge monitor for the first time. We found that made an amazing difference in the performance of a band."', 'Though PA was developing fast, column speakers still ruled. But that was also about to change. "Whatever you do with columns, you can’t project bass from them," Charlie told me. "So I made an exponential horn—a gigantic one coupled to a box with four Celestion speakers in it, facing each other into a three-inch channel with the horn bolted on." Charlie voiced it for his own ears, but when it was tested it was shown to have an almost perfectly flat frequency response. Still restless and inquisitive, Charlie experimented with parabolic dishes, but he failed to find speakers powerful enough to work with them.', 'Perhaps the ultimate WEM system was the Festival Stack, which comprised a pair of 15-inch low-end speakers, six ten-inch speakers for mids and highs, and a Vitavox or Celestion horn for the top end. This was the WEM PA purchased by Janis Joplin, who may have been its first customer, though some believe it made its debut at the turning point of WEM’s PA history—the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival.', 'However, just as Altamont in the USA had shown the first hint of the darkness that followed the Flower Power era of the late ‘60s, the Isle of Wight festival—which turned out to be Jimi Hendrix’s last gig in Britain—saw the mood changing in the UK, too. Crowd violence was becoming more common, and problems with a high wind meant the sound was better heard several miles away than in front of the stage.', 'Charlie was told the sound level from his PA at a 1972 festival in Grangemouth, Scotland, was a constant 128dB and that this was supposed to be dangerous. "Then there was a bloke with a knife at a gig, and the audiences started to change. It was all starting to worry me," he recalled, speaking in 2010. "So I went to see a medical specialist and asked him if it was possible that I could be responsible for making people go deaf. He said, ‘Well, if it gets too loud, yes.’ I can hear as good as anybody today—and that’s after I’d sat in front of PAs for Thin Lizzy and Slade night after night. Well, someone had to be wrong. But, either way, it didn’t leave a very good taste in my mouth."', 'Coupled with these doubts, Charlie saw the technology advancing around him. By about 1973, he felt he didn’t have anything left he wanted to do. "Kelsey-Morris had come out with a version of the W-bin at about that time, and their system was better than the W-bin, and they were better than me. Although they were terribly heavy to carry, I could see what was going to happen. Here they were with a 500-watt box against a great big WEM system. It seemed like it was time for me to hang up my headphones. So I just stopped."', 'Today, Charlie’s legacy is maintained by his widow, June, who still runs Watkins Electric Music. A license to produce Watkins guitar amps and the Copicat echo unit is held by Amp-Fix in the UK, but WEM PA equipment hasn’t been made since Charlie closed his factory in 1974. Which isn’t to say it doesn’t appear now and again, but its attraction these days is purely nostalgic. If you’re tempted, though, do take care—it’s easy enough to stencil the name of a famous band on a speaker, a mixer, or an amp, so make sure you get verifiable provenance.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Sale prices for the Moog Minimoog Model D 2016 reissue were trending higher than the original here on Reverb. Traditional wisdom says the older something is, the more valuable it is, but that’s not always true. It’s certainly not the case here. The answer is likely a bit more complicated than that.', 'Before we start answering that question, let’s take a closer look at the two variations of Minimoog.', 'The original Minimoog is perhaps the most iconic synthesizer of all time. It debuted in 1971 and had a manufacturing run of 10 years, ending in 1981. It was the first portable synthesizer built with a keyboard, the first sold in musical instrument shops, and for many, the first synthesizer they ever heard. It’s a bonafide classic—but we don’t need to tell you that.', 'In 2016, Moog reissued the Minimoog. Given the 35 years that had passed between the ending of the run of the original Minimoogs, Moog couldn’t just re-release it as is. They made a few small improvements, most notably in the form of a Fatar keybed and MIDI implementation. They also included a number of in-built modifications, such as a dedicated analog LFO, cableless feedback, a mixer overload mod, and CV outputs for pitch, gate, velocity and after pressure. After just one year, due to a scarcity of parts as a result of high demand, Moog decided to halt manufacturing.', 'Since the end of the run of the reissue, prices have remained relatively steady. Taking a look at the price guide, we can see that things go along as expected for the first three years. The reissue originally sold for $3,749, and this is reflected in its used price. Until this year, the price hovered around $3000. During the same time period, as we can see from its price guide, prices of the original fluctuated more wildly, with some as low as $2000 and as high as $4500. This discrepancy in prices is likely due to variations in condition.', 'In spring 2020, reissue prices suddenly started to climb. They went from that stable $3000 to well surpassing $6000 by November. Prices on original Model Ds also began a similar upward trajectory, but not until August. They’re currently hovering around $6000.', 'On average, the Minimoog reissue prices currently sit just a touch higher than the original, though the original model is certainly close behind. This has been the story for the last three months, with the two neck-and-neck and the reissue actually trending higher than the original for much of the late summer.', 'So, what’s going on? Why is the reissue suddenly so competitive, price-wise?', 'While the overall 2020 rise in prices on both units is likely due to the influence of COVID-19 and people wanting something to do while in lockdown, this is similar enough for both. To find out why the reissue should be so attractive, we took an informal poll on a popular synthesizer group on Facebook. We asked: If you had the means, which would you rather buy—an original or a reissue? We also asked people to leave comments on why they voted the way they did.', 'At the time of publication, the results were that the reissue got 57 votes, and the original got 11 votes. For the members of this particular group, the clear choice was the reissue. As to why, the comments section provided the answers. "I have vintage gear," wrote group member Jim Heywood. "It always needs something done to it. If I were buying a Minimoog, I\'d rather have something new that just works."', 'Wayne Lohr, who owns a number of classic synths like the Korg MS-20, Roland Juno-106, and even an original Minimoog, gave a similar response. "Vintage gear, while cool, is notoriously unreliable. There are many faithful reproductions that do the job reliably."', 'Many other commenters echoed these sentiments about reliability. The other big attractor was MIDI. Despite the limited functionality in the reissue Minimoog, the presence of MIDI was enough to sway a clear majority away from a vintage unit. One last factor that could have helped boost prices of the reissue is scarcity of units. The original was in production for 10 years while the reissue was only made for one year. It stands to reason that there would be fewer units on the market, thus helping inflate prices.', 'While the original is certainly still a classic, at this moment in time a number of people seem to be drawn to the reliability and features of the reissue. Those who missed it the first time around may be trying to snap one up now before prices go any higher.

Perhaps his friend Richard Hattrell shifted from one view to the other, because Richard was the one who Brian charmed (or manipulated) into buying Brian his first proper electric guitar in 1962.', 'One day in October, Brian—founder of a new group called The Rollin’ Stones—walked down Rupert Street in central London, just beyond the edge of Soho, and ducked into a tiny guitar shop called Sound City. He handed over Richard’s money and walked out with a Harmony Stratotone Mars H46, a guitar he used constantly with his band into the following year.', 'The Sound City shop was owned by Ivor Arbiter, whose interest in music had been sparked by his father, Joe, a saxophonist with the British big-band led by Harry Roy in the ‘30s and ‘40s. The young Ivor began his instrument career working at saxophone repair workshops in and around Soho, and in 1957, he opened his own Paramount woodwind and brass shop on Shaftesbury Avenue—the street that marked the southern boundary of Soho.', 'Ivor was an ambitious young man, and he saw further opportunities with the rise of pop music as the ‘60s came into view. In 1961, he opened Drum City at 114 Shaftesbury Avenue and the following year Sound City, which specialized in guitars and amps, at 24 Rupert Street.', 'Drum City’s most important sale in the early years was a Ludwig set—the enterprising Ivor had just secured a UK agency for these American drums—that Ringo Starr chose, apparently for the Ludwig oyster black pearl finish on offer. Ivor sketched out a Beatles logo for the bass-drum head, and the Beatles drop-T logo, created with little thought other than to close the deal, became one of the most recognizable music logos of all time.', 'Another Beatle lured by new American instruments at Ivor’s other shop, Sound City, was George Harrison, who popped into the Rupert Street shop in summer ’63, met the manager Bob Adams, and bought a new Gretsch Chet Atkins Country Gentleman. A few weeks later, he used it to record “She Loves You.”', 'So popular did the tiny Sound City shop become that, in March 1964, Ivor moved it to new premises just a few doors along from Drum City. The new Sound City at 124 Shaftesbury Avenue was on a corner site at Gerrard Place, in a building dating from the 1880s—and parts of it still felt distinctly Victorian.', 'A story circulated among staff that the famous escapologist Harry Houdini, during one of his many tours in Britain, had stored some props in the cellar of number 124, and that there they remained, rusting and crumbling, and just about visible for those brave enough to risk a peek in the dank, dark, rat-infested underworld.', 'Up on the ground floor showroom, things were a little better. Very soon after the move, the new shop was used as the location for a wonderfully-of-its-time Pathé news film featuring Sandra Barry & The Boys. The band, soon to become Mod darlings The Action, took advantage of the Gretsch stock at the shop, with Bam King selecting a lovely double-cut White Falcon.', 'Ivor’s drive to exploit every aspect of the burgeoning instrument business in Britain led him not only to run retail shops and distribute overseas brands, but also to manufacture his own gear, for sale in his shops and elsewhere. One famous instance was the Fuzz Face.', 'This simple but effective fuzzbox employed Ivor’s idea to adapt a mic-stand base as a roadworthy casing. Introduced in 1966, the Fuzz Face found instant fame when Jimi Hendrix picked one up at Shaftesbury Avenue and set its distorted abilities to work.', 'Gordon Hawtin, a.k.a. Sconehead, was a 16-year-old junior salesman at Sound City for a few months in 1967 (and again a little later), but his timing was good. “That February, Jimi Hendrix came in with Noel Redding and Jimi’s personal assistant, Tony Garland,” Gordon says.', '“Jimi picked up a Stratocaster, but the strings were the wrong orientation for him, and in a very funny and cheeky way, I commented that I could give Jimi some guitar lessons. In fact, I’d only been playing for 18 months and I was dreadful. But I said Jimi should give me a job in his band as the rhythm guitarist, and at that point Jimi and Noel fell about laughing.”', 'Gordon’s cheek paid off, though, when Noel asked to try out a Jazz Bass, which he ended up buying. “I sold Noel the bass for 100 guineas without case,” he remembers. “I put it in a cardboard shipping box, took it out to their waiting car, and off they went—but not before they invited me to come and see them at the Roundhouse later that month.”', 'Next to bolster the manufacturing part of Ivor’s empire was Sound City amplification, notably the One Hundred (or L100) head designed and built by Dave Reeves and introduced in 1967. Pete Townshend was an early and, for a while, committed user. The association with Dave Reeves did not last, however—he soon went off to design Hiwatt amps. Ivor meanwhile continued to produce Sound City amps and cabs with some design input from Dennis Cornell.', 'Another visitor to number 124 in 1967 was Eric Clapton, who bought a secondhand ’56 Strat there in May for £150 (about $350 at the time). It was the guitar later known as Brownie, used for work such as his first solo album and for Layla, both recorded in 1970. He would sell it in 1999 at one of his Crossroads charity auctions for $497,500 (plus buyer’s premium), a record for a guitar at the time and a price Clapton himself described as “astonishing.”', 'Back in 1968, Drum City received the first deliveries of drums by Hayman, another new Ivor-backed brand, and Hayman guitars followed a couple of years later, designed with help from Jim Burns.', 'By 1970, Doug Ellis was the new shop manager at Sound City, coming from Selmer, the competitor round the corner in Charing Cross Road. “Ivor was very anxious to push the Hayman guitars, but it was a bit of a challenge to move them,” Doug recalls. “We had a good selection of Fenders and Gibsons, some Gretsch models, too, and I would guess the mix between new and secondhand guitars was around two-thirds new.”', 'Sound City was among many shops in an area of London teeming with music and musicians. “We were very lucky to be in a perfect location,” Doug says, “and I always surrounded myself with good, enlightened people, like Jack Brand and Steve Sutherland, who regularly came up with suggestions worth getting behind.”', 'One distinction that set Sound City apart from the rest was the repair department. At first this was in the basement and run by John Marriott, a relative of Small Faces mainman Steve Marriott. When John died, Pete Cornish took over the job, and in order to free more showroom space, the repair shop with Pete in charge was moved to the Drum City basement at number 114.', 'Pete had to advise the jazz drummer Phil Seamen on a number of occasions that this was no longer Phil’s practice and teaching space. “Every day between one and two o’clock he would appear and ask me why I was there. Was I his pupil? And there I am working away on a bench with amps in bits and so on, and he’d insist he was still teaching there. I had to tell him it wasn’t like that any more, and I’d take him off to the pub and then leave him there.”', 'Pete’s background was in military electronics, and that proved to be a bonus on a few levels. “It’s debatable which is tougher on the gear, military or rock’n’roll,” Pete says with a smile.', '“I’d been working on things that would be dropped out of an aircraft at minus 40 degrees centigrade on to the Sahara desert at plus 50, and it had to survive. So with the military stuff, it has to work when it gets there—but usually only once. With rock’n’roll stuff, it has to work every day.”', 'The repair shop attracted roadies from all the big and not-so-big bands of the day. “If you fixed an amp and it actually worked, they would come back,” Pete explains.', '“There were so many people that purportedly could fix amps but actually made them worse, you know? Again, with my military training, it had to be perfect. And I would improve stuff, because the construction was appalling in a lot of cases. I knew about sealing things and putting lock nuts on, all these things that were quite standard to me but not common in the music area.”', 'The boss would sometimes appear on Saturdays, up to town for a haircut. “Ivor would arrive in his E-Type Jag,” Doug Ellis says, “and on one occasion he’d left it parked outside, left the keys with me, and asked me to keep an eye on it. I wasn’t paying attention right until the last minute, when a chap was pushing a portable hot-dog stand along Shaftesbury Avenue with his head down.', '"I only saw him when he was three feet from the back of Ivor’s Jag. I opened my mouth and the usual slow-motion thing kicked in, and he smacked it right up the chrome bumper. I leapt out there—that E-Type was Ivor’s pride and joy. Luckily, he’d hardly touched it, so nobody ever knew. But Ivor—he was a character. He came up with all sorts of ideas, some of them smarter than others. But he was a real entrepreneur.”', 'Ivor’s luck ran out with this particular portion of his operation in 1975, when a complicated set of business problems meant his shops—Sound City and Music City (by now in the Drum City location), and Modern Sound in Tottenham Court Road—were swiftly closed.', '“We got 15 minutes notice,” Pete Cornish recalls. “Quarter to five, the bailiffs or whoever they were came in, said give us the keys, you’ve got 15 minutes to grab your coat. We all went and stood on the pavement outside going, ‘Wha… What happened?’ As far as we knew, we were taking two million pounds a year.”', 'And that was that. Today, though, memories linger for those who worked there and bought stuff there and had gear repaired there. “Sound City was a very busy place with a nice friendly atmosphere,” Gordon Hawtin recalls. “Lots of roadies were in and out, Pete Townshend and John Entwistle bought strings, Jack Bruce bought harmonicas. And Saturdays! We had to endure ‘Hey Joe,’ ‘Purple Haze,’ and ‘Sunshine Of Your Love’ played badly eight-trillion-million times every Saturday.”', 'The two City shops in their heyday became something of a social centre for the tech community, Doug Ellis says. “And not always conveniently so, because we were a bit pushed for space in number 124. Nonetheless, they didn’t do any harm, and it was all pretty laidback. It wasn’t the tidiest of shops, but it wasn’t scruffy, and we always did a nice window. It was quite homely and it seemed appropriate for the music business—and a haven for roadies.”', 'Pete Cornish remembers piles and piles of seemingly unending repairs, for Queen, Slade, Yes, and many, many more. “All the bands, big and small, were in every week with their amps for regular maintenance. And this was the glory days when a Mullard EL34 valve cost 80p [about $2 at the time]. If only I’d known and laid down a few thousand, like fine wine. Imagine! I used to go to the wholesalers and just pick up a box of a hundred. If only we’d known.”', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

Reverb. So far, we've shared numbers on the pedal, microphone, and synth market, and today we're turning our attention to amplifiers. Take a look below for the rankings of best-selling guitar and bass amps of 2020, as well as an overview of the market on a brand basis.", 'Like other gear categories on Reverb, 2020 saw a major influx of new and beginner players buying amps as COVID-19 and social distancing inspired many people to start playing more music. Specifically, this had the effect of elevating sales on affordable and beginner friendly amps like the Boss Katana series. Simultaneously, at different points in 2020, supply chain issues and store closures had many players turn to the used market for their gear, and combined, this all had the effect of generating a general lift in used prices throughout the gear market.', "See where your favorite amps and amp brand ranked this year below, and to compare to last year's numbers, click here to view the best-selling amps of 2019.", "First up is our ranking of overall best-selling guitar amps. This list is based on total orders on Reverb inclusive of both new and used gear (though when separating out to just new or just used, the rankings don't really change all that much).", 'Somewhat predictably, the best-selling amps on Reverb are affordable models from well-known brands where this is ample supply and interest. Some models, like the pair of Fender reissues, fit a more traditional tube amp mold, while others like the Boss amps and the Yamaha THR-10 offer some new tech like onboard effects.', "Next, a look at the best-selling bass amp models of 2020. Compared to the guitar amp list above, the composition of the 2020 bass amp list actually changed a bit more over 2019. Notably, a number of higher-powered Class D heads like the Darkglass Microtubes 900 and Mesa Boogie Subway D-800 feel out of the top 15, which makes sense given that these are heads geared towards gigging musicians and given the lack of live music in 2020, it's fairly clear while demand for the type of amp would lesson.", 'In closing, here\'s an overview of the best-selling amps on Reverb on a brand basis. We\'ve divided this into two lists: the overall best sellers, topped by Fender, Marshall, and Orange, and then a second list for "high-end" brands to give some insight into where various boutique amp makers stack up. While its a somewhat arbitrary line, for "high-end," we\'re simply filtering to brands with an average amp sale price of greater than $1,000 USD.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

top-selling pedals and microphones on Reverb in 2020, and today we're turning our sights to the realm of synths and drum machines. Like these other gear categories, 2020 saw a major influx of beginner and other sorts of music makers into the gear market as lockdowns and social distancing gave people new time to explore the hobby. And after all, what better way to spend time at home than by plugging into a synth or groovebox and getting lost in sound for a little while?", "Below you'll find the top-selling pieces of gear from a four different categories followed by some overall numbers on a brand basis. In all of these charts, we're going by cumulative sales on Reverb inclusive of both new and used gear. However, when breaking down to just new or just new, the rankings remain relative similar.", 'This year, the Teenage Engineering OP-1 maintained its reign as the top-selling synthesizer on Reverb. While there have been some points in the past few years where availability of this unit has been limited, 2020 saw robust sales for both new and used units, which makes sense given that in many ways, this multi-faceted device is the perfect socially distant music maker.', "Some may wonder how this somewhat pricey device could possibly sell more than something like a Korg Minilogue and there are some important factors to keep in mind. For one, these rankings are, of course, limited to sales on Reverb and are probably different from the industry and gear market more broadly. If the OP-1 is most consistently available on Reverb and we claim a higher percentage of its total sales than other synths, that gives it a leg up over products where the global inventory is more widespread. Additionally, the OP-1 is a relatively unique piece of gear meaning that it's the only option for folks looking for something with its particular feature set (something that is perpetuated by its popularity with YouTubers like Andrew Huang). Comparatively, buyers looking for a basic subtractive synth like the Minilogue have a wealth of other options like the Behringer Model D, the Arturia Brute series, not to mention Korg's own variations like the Monologue and Minilogue XD. So while that buyer group may be spread out across a bunch of comparable products, the OP-1 stands on its own racking up more total sales.", 'As far as new releases, the Moog Subharmonicon sold extremely well upon its initial release, though the Behringer TD-3 may have that beat if it can be counted as a 2020 release (it was announced in 2019 though appears to not have started shipping until a little bit later).', 'Compared to the 2019 list, the Elektron Digitone shot up to the highest echelon of the list, reflecting strong sales for that brand overall. Behringer synths also sold well in 2020—though this is one area where the Reverb market is likely different from the synth market globally, as presumably many Behringer products are purchased as pre-orders from large retailers elsewhere on the internet.', 'The other major gear storyline for 2020 was a general lift in used prices, especially when it comes to beginner-friendly gear like entry-level recording interfaces and acoustic guitars. The reasons for this are basically twofold: first, a ton of novice music makers decided to use this year to get into making music, causing a large influx of new buyers to the market. Simultaneously, supply chain issues and store closures, especially in the spring, limited the availability of brand-new gear, prompting many buyers to turn to the used market. The effect was a general lift in used pricing as well as a decrease in the time to sale for lots of used listings on Reverb. For a sense of how pricing changed on any of the synths in these charts, click on the link and scroll down the Price Guide graph on the individual product pages.', "For this year's post, we've opted to delineate synths and drum machines (along with samplers and grooveboxes) into different rankings. Below you'll find the top-selling of the later category, though admittedly, there is some gear that's on the fence such as the Novation Circuit or various Elektron devices.", 'Next up, we turn to the Eurorack market where the Make Noise Maths continues its streak as the king of bloop mountain. While of course, the great thing about Eurorack is that everyone’s setup is unique and personal and there are tons of cool modules out there to suit specific sonic needs, there remain a handful of useful Swiss Army knife models that can find application in virtually any system. Many of the top sellers here can be categorized as such.', "Fourth up, we turn to the vintage segment of the market where we're lumping together everything synth, drum machine, and sampler made prior to the year 2000. The Juno-106 continues to be the vintage synth that's traded most frequently on Reverb and also ranks in the top spot in terms of dollars spent, not just sales volume as shown here. This year has also seen a continuation of the popularity of rackmount sound modules like the Yamaha TX81Z, which a lot of players have uncovered for their excellent value relative to some of their flashier keyboard equivalents.", "Overall, though, the list is similar to the 2019 rankings—you can look at the 2019 version of this article here if you want to compare more closely. There some new entrants, though, including the Roland D-50 and Casio CZ-101, both widely produced digital synths that came out in the '80s. Also new to the top 15 was the Roland TR-606 which also saw a major increase in average price through the course of the year. What's interesting about this placement is that 2020 also saw two different recreations of the classic TR-606 in the form of the Roland TR-06 and Behringer's RD-6 clone. Both releases probably helped to shine some new light on the appeal of the original prompting renewed interest and increased sales. This dynamic of a reissue raising interest an original is not uncommon in the vintage gear market and certainly not limited to synths either.", 'In closing, here is a quick snapshot of the synth market on Reverb in 2020 on a brand basis.

Next up in our series is microphones. Below you’ll find the rankings for the top selling microphones on Reverb in 2020, followed by a snapshot of sales broken down along brand lines.', 'In 2020, we saw a major increase in the number of people buying mics of all sorts, reflecting a general rise in interest in home recording as a result of COVID-19 lockdowns and social distancing. Tried-and-true beginner friendly standards like the Audio-Technica AT2020 and Shure SM57 continued to sell well, as did all manner of other home recording gear—basic recording interfaces, monitors, headphones, and more.', 'While these forces caused a general lift in overall sales volume, the breakdown of most popular microphone models remained more or less similar to previous years. Take a look below at our rankings and let us know in the comments what recording gear inspired you in 2020.', 'Check out more best-selling category lists from 2020: Best-Selling Pedals, Best-Selling Synths and Drum Machines.', 'Note that the rankings on this page are inclusive of both new and used sales, though when filtered to just new or just used, the rankings do not differ all that much. Additionally, where applicable, we’ve combined stereo pair sales as just one sale though the average used prices displayed are for just single microphones.', 'With some exceptions, the overall best-selling list tends to be dominated by more affordable options aimed at the beginner market. To give a glance at the more pro segment of the microphone world, here are the best sellers of 2020 filtered to just microphones with an average used sale price of over $500 USD.', 'The biggest storyline from the used microphone market in 2020 was a general increase in used prices. Across the board, bluechip used microphones not only increased in used sale price on Reverb, but also saw faster sales from the point of listing in essentially every microphone category. Some examples:', 'Increasing prices on used microphones was not limited to the perennial top-sellers listed above either. The Townsend Labs Sphere L22 jumped considerably this year, as did the recently discontinued Sony C-800G which essentially doubled in price in a matter of months. The Manley Reference Cardioid remains the most popular large diaphragm tube mic despite its upper-market price tag, and this year the average used value continued to increase even while new ones are in steady supply.', 'The reason for this general lift in used prices is due to a few main factors. On the demand side, as mentioned above, 2020 saw a huge number of musicians, podcasters, and other creatives looking to get into recording for the first time. A good snapshot of this trend can be found in looking at sale prices as well as time-to-sale for used USB microphones, which are often recommended as go-to first steps for new recordists. Prices on used USB mics went up by about 15% while the time to sale went down by about 30%. Similar trends can be found when looking at this metric in related categories such as entry-level interfaces.', 'On the supply side, the music gear industry (like many industries) faced a number of supply chain challenges and part shortages this year as a result of COVID-19, particularly in the spring. As the supply of new gear from brands was held up, many folks flocked to the used market which had the effect of increasing demand and thus increasing prices and decreasing time-to-sale.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

This year, we’re kicking things off with a look at the pedal market in 2020 and will follow up through the rest of the week with posts covering synths and drum machines, microphones, and amplifiers.', 'Needless to say, 2020 was an unprecedented year in many respects with lockdowns and social distancing becoming the new normal for much of the world. The guitar market was certainly not insulated from these shifts, and as has been reported elsewhere, this year saw a number of newer players take up the guitar as a hobby. This trend seems to have played out into the pedal arena as well, with heightened sales of beginner-friendly gear such as the top-ranking TC Electronic Ditto Looper and Boss DS-1.', "At the same time, we also saw a number of more specialized and higher-end pedals sell quite strongly, perhaps reflecting more seasoned players spending more time with their sound-crafting endeavors and thus seeking new tools to find new sonic spaces to explore. If there's any constant, it's that, just as in past years, there are a lot of really cool pedals out there, with more hitting the scene every month.", "Take a look below for this year's rankings, starting with the overall best-selling list side-by-side with the best-selling new releases of the year. If you'd like to compare with previous years' rankings, you can see the best-selling pedals of 2019, 2018, and 2017 through these links.", 'Check out more best-selling category lists from 2020: Best-Selling Microphones, Best-Selling Synths and Drum Machines.', "The rankings above are based on total number of orders on Reverb for the year. The overall list of best-sellers, which is mostly tried-and-true mainstays, reflects all sales inclusive of both new and used gear. Conversely, the rankings for the new releases are just for brand-new sales to try to highlight the models' initial popularity. This is different from last year's list, in which we included used sales in both columns.", 'Speaking of new releases, we\'ve also elected to filter out a few pedals that launched exclusively on Reverb from this list, which include the Jackson Audio Golden Boy and "The Pedal Movie" exclusive Bliss Factory and Time Shadows.', 'As always with these sorts of posts, there are clearly some areas where the market on Reverb likely stands out from the pedal market more broadly. For instance, the preponderance of some higher-end models among the new release list—such as the Strymon NightSky and Chase Bliss Automatone—has a lot to do available inventory. While these sorts of pedal may not always be available everywhere, the wide range of specialist dealers who operate on Reverb means that most brands in the boutique pedal space are usually well represented.', "This sort of dynamic is magnified in the case of something like the ninth-ranking Hologram Microcosm. Hologram Electronics itself sells this pedals directly through a Reverb shop, and if that's how people are buying this fantastically innovative device, that concentration of sales reflects in these rankings.", "As has been the case in past years, pedals that are released earlier in the year around NAMM obviously get a bit of a leg up compared to newer releases that don't have as much time to rack up sales. A good example of that this year would be the JHS 3 Series, which were released in October. Had these pedals come out back in January, they likely would all rank in the top-selling new release column.", "Turning to the overall best-selling list, some shifts this year include both the Strymon Timeline and BigSky leaving the rankings, possibly as a reflection of buyers opting for the company's newer releases like the NightSky or Volante. The EarthQuaker Devices Plumes shot up to the seventh spot on the list while Electro-Harmonix Soul Food left the top 15 for the first time since its introduction.", 'Some might be perplexed by the lack of the iconic Dunlop Cry Baby Wah or EHX Big Muff on this list. In both cases (and lots of others) this is due to the fact that sales for these pedals are spread out across dozens of different individual models currently produced by each company. Were they taken in aggregate, both would probably ranking in the top ten.', "And in closing, we're going to show a quick snap shot of the 2020 pedal market on Reverb by brand. These graphs represent the relative share of the top 15 makes in each category.", 'By the way, if you love pedals, be sure to watch the trailer for our forthcoming documentary, "The Pedal Movie."', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

It just sort of happened, naturally, whenever a curious musician or a devoted gear-head (or both) wanted to record themselves but didn't want to pay a commercial studio. The answer was to have your own studio at home, or at least close to home. The idea seems blindingly obvious today. We can have gloriously useful stacks of tech at-the-ready in order to capture our creative outpourings for as little or as much as we care to spend. Back in the olden days, however, it was a more complicated affair.", 'Les Paul was a pioneer. Bing Crosby encouraged Les to build a studio into the garage of Les\' home in Hollywood, and it was here that he would experiment—at first cutting to discs, then to tape. Using early sound-on-sound techniques, Les created an orchestra of massed guitars playing catchy instrumental tunes. Capitol signed him and what they called his New Sound, releasing Les Paul\'s first multi-guitar single, "Lover," in 1948. After a long break to recover from a car accident, he found greater fame when he added vocalist Mary Ford to the act. Les gave his guitars and now Mary\'s voice the multiple recording treatment, and "How High The Moon" went to number one in 1951.', 'Musicians in later decades, too, recognized the advantages that came from having recording gear at home, usually as a means of creating demos without the hassle and cost of setting up in a major commercial studio. Several Beatles had Brenell recorders at home—John Lennon as early as 1964—and Bob Dylan and The Band recorded what became known as The Basement Tapes in 1967 at various locations around Woodstock, New York, using an Ampex 2-track, Altec mixer boxes, and some good mics.', "There were many others, and one rich seam of home recording developed in and around San Francisco and the Bay Area in the late '60s and into the '70s. Alembic had started out there as more of a concept than a company, turning into a sort of electronics workshop as part of the community that grew around the Grateful Dead.", 'At first, Alembic was charged to come up with new ways to provide clear and accurate recordings of Dead concerts so that the band could improve their performances. From this, they became generally interested in improving the quality of their studio and live sound by refining the various elements of the process, from the front-end instruments and microphones through to the PA systems and recording equipment.', 'Alembic branched into three areas, becoming a recording studio, a developer of PA systems, and a workshop for guitar repair and modification run by Rick Turner—a one-time Massachusetts folk guitarist and guitar repairer.', '"Home studios started popping up at all kinds of levels on the San Francisco scene around 1971," Rick tells me. "They were equipped with \'real\' studio gear, but about half of them were not really well set up for mixing," he continues. "The ones I recall were started by Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane—he had a 16-track in San Francisco—and also Carlos Santana, with a 16-track facility in Mill Valley, as well as Mickey Hart of Grateful Dead, who had an 8-track setup and then a 16, in Novato."', 'Graham Nash and Jerry Garcia had 16-track studios, Rick recalls: Graham in San Francisco and Jerry in Stinson Beach. "Banana and Jesse Colin Young of The Youngbloods had 8-tracks—Banana was in Inverness, and Jesse, who went on to 16 and then 24-track, was in Inverness Ridge. I think the only one of those left today is that old Jesse Colin Young studio, now known for Owl Mountain Sessions. It\'s run by my son, Ethan Turner, who has it as a ProTools or an Otari 24-track analogue studio."', "Stephen Barncard is best known as a producer and engineer who made records on the West Coast such as the Grateful Dead's American Beauty and David Crosby's If I Could Only Remember My Name. He'd grown up in Kansas City, and his dad was an executive at AT&T there. As a result, Stephen tells me, he found himself in the happy position of being surrounded by tech stuff, and from that the teenager developed a passion for radio and for recording in the '60s.", "Stephen started making modest radio setups at home with his dad's help, and when he began playing bass in bands, his combined interests led inevitably to a studio at home with his parents in Prairie Village. That first studio had basic but useful appointments—a Presto 1/4-inch full-track mono tape recorder and a Roberts 1/4-inch stereo machine; a 4-channel and two 3-channel mixers; a Presto disc cutter; a patchbay made in high school metal shop.", '"It was my reward for cutting the grass and painting the fence, and it gave me my early seat-of-the-pants knowledge," he says. "I was probably the only kid on my block with this kind of setup, probably the only one in the county, other than the local commercial studio, which was run by Vic Damon."', 'By 1966, Stephen was still playing, by now in a busy semi-pro band, and his studio had evolved, notably with better mics, including an RCA 74B Junior Velocity. He cut a single there early in \'67 with The Young Aristocracy, "Don\'t Lie" c/w "Look And See," since considered a garage classic. The studio wasn\'t in the garage, it was in the basement, but no matter. "I thought I was a producer," Stephen says with a smile. "I certainly wanted to be."', 'His audio skills were of good practical use when he managed to avoid the draft by faking his performance at the military board\'s hearing test. "I didn\'t want to come home in a box!" he says. Next, Stephen figured the West Coast was the place to go if he wanted to fulfill his dream to become a record producer. On a reconnaissance trip, he attended a Grateful Dead New Year\'s gig in San Francisco, taking the opportunity to record the show on his portable Norelco.', "By 1969, he had a job offer in Los Angeles at the Village Recorders, a studio in a building converted to the purpose a few years earlier. On the way to LA, he finagled a meeting with Mel Tanner, the studio manager at Wally Heider's brand new studio in San Francisco, who told him to write directly to Wally.", '"I figured San Francisco was cooler than LA," he remembers, "and my goal was to work there with bands as an indie producer. I sent Wally a rambling three-page letter telling him about my experience, and he offered to show me around the 16-track San Francisco studio. Afterwards, he asked if I\'d like to work there. I said I guess so!"', 'The first big project Stephen saw at Heider\'s was Jefferson Airplane\'s Volunteers, although two union guys from RCA ran the session, and he remembers his tasks were limited to fetching microphones. Never mind—this was the real thing. "I got put in with Crosby Stills Nash & Young as an active assistant, and that was a big deal. Then came sessions with Grateful Dead, with Garcia, several albums with New Riders Of The Purple Sage, also with Brewer & Shipley, with David Crosby solo, with RJ Fox."', 'He rented a house in Sausalito—Heider was paying good money—and Stephen\'s urge to set up a home studio was active once again. "From a producer\'s point of view, it would mean I had my own time to develop sounds with a minimal amount of equipment. It was a laboratory and it was a recording space, and I loved that. I was really making demos for developing acts, and also it helped me develop as a producer. But my main aim was to work with simple 4-track techniques that I never had in Kansas, a big hole in my engineering development that I wanted to fill. Even though I had access to state-of-the-art gear back at Wally\'s, I wanted to challenge myself with the restrictions. I always thought restrictions make better, more spontaneous music."', 'Stephen\'s control room was in the basement of his house. "This weird, dirty basement," he recalls, "and I\'d run a snake up to the living room where the mics and amps were. I had no console, an inexpensive Sony mic mixer, a homemade 8-channel monitor mixer, a Tascam 2-track, a talkback and playback monitor switching using a consumer hi-fi, and some limiters and equalizers I made from op-amp units that I got from a guy in LA called Bel Losmandy, who mainly supplied to the movie industry. The information I got from Bel\'s Opamp Labs products, and from Bel in particular, shaped my studio design chops for years into the future."', 'He did have a nice Ampex AG-440B 4-track that Bob Matthews, the Grateful Dead engineer, loaned him for a year or so. "With that, I could get pretty good reductions, Beatles-style. But I wasn\'t really an equipment hound—I was into working with what I had. That\'s always been my motto."', 'When Stephen worked at Heider\'s with the Dead on American Beauty in the latter months of 1970, he learned some more about the social aspects of recording. "I\'d heard all these people would hang out with the Dead, about sessions that went on for hours, that they\'d experiment and dick around. I liked to do my dicking around at my own place, and do my learning experience on my own dime and my own time. In my socks, if I wanted."', 'He also learned about the value in having somewhere to prepare for an album—a home studio, say—that was away from the confines and costs of a commercial studio. "American Beauty was the only Dead record where they had done their homework," he says. "I found out recently that before we worked on it at Heider\'s, they had done the whole record at another studio. In addition to the Workingman\'s Dead situation, which was done at Pacific High, they had recorded most of the American Beauty songs with Phil Sawyer there, as well," Stephen says. "These earlier demo recordings are now available on a release called The Angel\'s Share, but I had nothing to do with those tapes."', 'Stephen recalls that when it came to American Beauty, the Dead faced an issue with their record company, Warner Bros—simply put, they\'d had no hits. "The word from above was have a hit or you guys are going to get dropped. The last studio album they had made was Aoxomoxoa, which was a very experimental record, a cult record. So much nitrous oxide, so much LSD. They had to make a real record. Their lyricist Robert Hunter had written a bunch of tunes—and, basically, they invented Americana when we made American Beauty."', 'The Youngbloods—Jesse Colin Young, Lowell "Banana" Levinger, and Joe Bauer—were looking for a new deal in 1969 after a few years with RCA, aiming for a more progressive company. The band, which at first had included Jerry Corbitt in the line-up, had recorded their first two albums at RCA\'s New York City studio, while the third, Elephant Mountain, was cut at the company\'s studio in LA, the ambitiously named Music Center Of The World.', '"We got an amazing deal with Warner Bros records when that RCA contract expired," Banana tells me. Warner Bros granted the band their own record label, Raccoon Records. "And they let us build recording studios out in Inverness in West Marin, north of San Francisco," he says. "Jesse and I each had our own studio, and this meant we didn\'t have to go to Los Angeles to record—with the new deal, we had already done some recording at the Warner Bros studios in LA." Banana adds that he had already recorded in many San Francisco studios as a sideman, and also he\'d produced other folks\' records.', '"Warner Bros also agreed to put out any records we made with other artists," he continues, "as long as we gave the company a couple of Youngbloods records every year. So we made all those crazy Raccoon Records albums, from jazz to bluegrass to unknown folk artists." They included four Youngbloods albums, Rock Festival (1970), Good And Dusty and Ride The Wind (1971), and High On A Ridge Top (\'72), plus solo LPs from Jesse Colin Young, Banana (& The Bunch), and Joe Bauer, and records by the likes of jazz pianist Kenny Gill, folk and country-bluesman Michael Hurley, and the bluegrass band High Country.', 'Banana says he set up his home studio around 1971. "I got a 3M 8-track and a 3M 2-track, and my board was a custom one-of-a-kind made for me by Alembic. I had McIntosh tube amps, and I had some pretty nice outboard gear, along with reasonably good mics." He recalls that he was a keen reader of the trade magazines and already had good experience of what to expect and what he might want from a studio of his own.', '"Yes, I read the audio magazines," he says, "and I had recorded in other studios, so I pretty much knew what the quality stuff was. I converted the little cabin in back of my house to be the studio, and I enclosed the back deck of the cabin, doubling its size. That new room was the control room, and the former back wall had a big window installed. The original main room was the recording room. I covered the outside walls with Leadex for soundproofing—and the neighbors never complained. I remember I had a nice Steinway piano in there."', 'Beyond the general construction work and acquiring the gear to go into it, Banana says the hardest part of setting up his new studio came when he had to connect everything up. "We had some fun trying to get all the wiring and cables and snakes and patchbay working out properly. But the room fortunately sounded great right from the start, and we were able to get good separation without much leakage at all."', 'That location served him well for a time, but then he shifted a touch south from Inverness and tried a different focus. "The home studio had worked out just fine," Banana says, "and we made a bunch of records there, and also we had artist friends come in to do demos and such. I was in the process of moving the studio when The Youngbloods played their last gig in September of 1973. So no more home studio: I moved it to a house I bought in Point Reyes Station, and that was no longer a home studio. It was a commercial studio, trying to make money. And that was an enormous effort. Had I not done it, I might be a rich man today," he adds with a laugh.', 'Dead guitarist Bob Weir had a studio, too, at his home in Mill Valley, and Stephen Barncard designed it. At first it was intended to be a rehearsal studio, with the possibility to record tracks of high quality that could be finished later in a more professional setting, but Stephen discovered the control room area was too small for a regular console, so he had to build the electronics from scratch.', '"Bob\'s house was an architect\'s wet dream," he says, "all these angles. He built the studio next to it the same way—and that was the problem. It was up on stilts, and later, in phase two of this studio, Bob would bring in Phil Lesh\'s bass system, and an entire band, and there were some major problems."', 'Stephen sourced an 8-track Scully in Alabama, which he says turned out to be the machine used to record the Stones hit "Wild Horses." By the middle of \'74, the studio was ready for rehearsal use, but only one demo was cut with the setup. "I was approached about making the studio ready to record 16-track, because Bob wanted to record the Grateful Dead\'s next record there, which was to be Blues For Allah. So phase two of this studio began."', 'Dead aide Dan Healy gave Stephen good advice, turning him on to some new monolithic op-amps, which helped a lot. "And I hired people to help assemble my designs, including Odis Schmidt, Robbie Taylor, and George Gruel. The Dead were ready to record Blues For Allah by the spring of \'75, and the studio was finished on time."', 'Despite his efforts, however, Stephen felt he was being forgotten. "I thought my reward with all this work I\'d done for Weir—I had been living and working in that studio for over a year and a half—would be that I\'d work on the next Grateful Dead record." He remembers a gathering of the whole band where he asked why he was not called to work on Blues For Allah.', '"Jerry Garcia said, \'Why don\'t you and Dan Healy both do it?\' Neither Healy or I liked the idea but we said we\'d try. Well, it turns out I was just standing in the back. What I should have done was just produce, you know? Lean on the talkback and make suggestions, be the authoritative guy. But at that point, I thought I ought to be doing the laying of hands on the faders, controlling things. I was frustrated, appalled at the lack of memory of what we had made with American Beauty. Weir\'s only answer was that I was dealing with a bunch of mush-headed musicians. So I decided it was time for me to move down to LA, where I had a standing offer to go back to the Village Recorders."', "Stephen built yet another studio, this one in Beverly Glen in LA, while he worked at Village Recorders and Armin Steiner's Sound Labs studio, recording Crosby & Nash's Wind On The Water (1975) and Whistling Down The Wire ('76). He got rid of his studio gear following an offer from Elektra/Asylum, where he worked in the A&R department, before moving a few years later to A&M studios as a technical designer.", 'After living in France for a while, he returned to the Bay Area, and since 1999 he\'s been working from his home there once more, doing multitrack mixdown, producing, programming, electronic design, video editing, and voiceover producing. "My life has been enriched by everything I did with home studios," Stephen says. "I built it all on the foundation of my experiences with home studios. They were my personal laboratories."', 'Meanwhile, Rick Turner looks back at the home studio scene in the Bay Area during the \'70s with affection—and some regret. "Some of these \'studios\' were not much more than a multitrack recorder and a rudimentary recording and mixing console," he says. "Most were not super loaded with microphones and outboard gear. But records were indeed made, even if a lot of the studios were intended mostly for getting ideas down on tape."', 'However, the growth of the home studio certainly had an effect on the business that Rick and Alembic were trying to develop in the area. "The home studios were what really killed our attempts to build a major studio, the Alembic studio, which was at 60 Brady Street in San Francisco," he says.', '"What we had that nobody else had was a big, big room, fully acoustically treated, and we had two live echo chambers, plus an EMT plate reverb. But we had to get about $60 an hour for recording time on 16-track." Home studios effectively put paid to some commercial recording studios, Rick says, including Alembic. "Also, in came things like listenable reverb-in-a-box. Then, toward the end of the \'70s, stuff like the Portastudio cassette multitrackers came along, the first machines designed as affordable home-recording stations. They really put the final nails in the coffins of many studios."', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

But while growing up, he was always surrounded by music, musicians, and record-buying friends. Once he started taking photographs, which would become his life's work, he often shot bands and concerts, along with whatever other subjects piqued his interest.", 'Later on, he began documenting record collectors, first as a photo project, then a website, and then the popular book Dust & Grooves: Adventures in Record Collecting. Vinyl enthusiasts proved to be enthralling subjects, with their obsessive hunts and their desire to uncover rare gems.', 'In two new books, he fixes his lens to an analogous realm: the wide world of effects pedals.', "Stompbox: 100 Pedals of the World's Greatest Guitarists is the first. It offers snapshots into artists' creativity by way of one particular pedal: like Tom Morello's Digitech WH-1 Whammy, John Frusciante's Ibanez WH10 Wah, or other premier pieces of pro guitarists' rigs.", "The photography shows off the artist's pedals in all of their ragged glory, scarred by countless tours. When looking at, say, Lee Ranaldo's AD-80 Analog Delay, you see all the marks and warts—the chipped chassis and the gaffer tape with scrawled settings.", '"I approached this project as a visual artist, and less so from the editorial content—so it was obvious to me and super important to bring in experts who know about the subject matter," Paz says. "I didn\'t start the project until I had a strong backbone of experts and writers."', "Stombox includes contributions from some of the best gear writers today—like Dave Hunter, Barry Cleveland, Richard Bienstock, and James Rotondi (who was the book's early editor too). Thanks to their work, we get short, intimate interviews with the artists themselves, who tell why the exact pedals in question are so important to them.", "The book's second and final editor, Dan Epstein—a prolific writer and guitarist who has written about music gear for more than 20 years at places like Guitar Player, as well as books on everything from Buck Owens to baseball—spent a lot of time securing these interviews.", '"In many cases, the guitarists we wanted to talk to had a particularly iconic sound, based on a certain pedal that they\'ve used. And as you know, pedals don\'t stick around the way guitars or amps stick around," Epstein says. "So a lot of times we\'d approach some guitarists, and they\'d be like, \'Yeah, I\'m into it. How about we talk about this new pedal I just bought last week that I love?\' And I was like, \'No, no, we want to talk about this one you used 20, 40 years ago.\'"', 'That mission, ultimately, was successful. So, Stompbox presents Steve Albini on his Interfax Harmonic Percolator HP-1, Thurston Moore on his Ludwig Phase II Synthesizer, Sarah Lipstate on her Boomerang III Phrase Sampler, Jack White on his Third Man Bumble Buzz, and more.', 'In compiling Stompbox, Paz and Epstein stumbled upon a kind of side quest. When asking artists to show off their single most-important pedal, they started to hear stories of truly rare effects and wild collections.', "Thus, Vintage and Rarities: 333 Cool, Crazy and Hard to Find Guitar Pedals was launched. In this second book, players and collectors eagerly talk about the absolute strangest, oldest, and rarest effects in their collections—and thanks to Paz's photographs, they're presented in all of their stunning visual glory.", "Paz and Epstein have allowed us to highlight 10 of the rarest pedals they've uncovered in Vintage & Rarities—though there are, in all honesty, far too many delightful oddities for us to list here.", 'Take a look below, then head to The Stompbox Book Official Reverb Shop to order one or both books.', "This rarity belongs to Vince Pupillo Sr., the associate director of the Electronic Music Education and Preservation Project (EMEAPP), a private musical instrument museum in Philadelphia. This wooden Sola Sound Tone Bender is not only the rarest in his collection, it's one of the rarest in any—one whose mere existence is almost beyond belief.", 'According to Vintage & Rarities, it is one of maybe 10 wooden wedges made by Gary Hurst for Sola Sound in 1965, before metal enclosures became the norm. (And at least a few of the other wooden ones were broken by a heavy-footed Jeff Beck.) This particular one contains the original MK1 circuit, with the internal components "merely linked together, without being mounted on a circuit board."', "Back in the '60s, Sola Sound was the sister company to Macari's music store. Ant Macari is the son (and nephew) of the co-founders, and he still runs the store today with his cousin Steve. In the store's basement lies untold treasures of pedals' past—a collection of gear history and family history that Macari is always trying to add to.", 'Of the many rarities in his collection, the Rangemaster Fuzzbug may be one of the most historic—not necessarily because of what it is, but what it inspired. "It\'s a gorgeous little thing. I love it," Macari says. Arbiter, apparently, loved it too, as that company took the Fuzzbug\'s modified Tone Bender MK1.5 circuit and turned it into their very first Fuzz Face.', 'Professional guitarist Jerry McPherson has amassed quite a collection. He has a particular fondness toward early, strange pedals from Electro-Harmonix, and the pedal featured here is a strange one indeed.', 'Like a one-off version of Neil Young\'s amp-top Whizzer, the Hotfoot Universal Pedal is a mechanical device that doesn\'t make any sound of its own. Instead you can clamp the arm onto any potentiometer of another pedal. “It’s a great companion to any pedal where you want to control a knob with your foot,” says Jerry McPherson. “I remember early Electro-Harmonix ads would show it hooked to a Deluxe Memory Man."', "You might be thinking, How is a Tube Screamer rare? But this is not just any Tube Screamer—it's a version so hard to find that Ibanez had to borrow it from its current owner to make a recent 35th anniversary reissue.", 'Wolf Merkel, the man behind one of the internet\'s best vintage pedal resources, Tonehome, says, “I have probably the most comprehensive collection of Ibanez pedals of the early years, 1974 to 1984. … and some are so rare that not even Ibanez headquarters has them in their vault."', 'Such is the case with this "narrow box" TS-808, with the "flying fingers" decal on its side. "These pilot run pedals were only displayed at trade shows and handed out to mega-dealers and some gear-testing journalists," says Merkel. "I know of only three existing samples."', "Yoshi Murata manages Hoochie's Guitar Shop in Tokyo's Shibuya-Ka business district. As you can imagine, that gives him quite a position to scout out the best the effects world has to offer, particularly Japanese vintage specimens.", 'The Elka Dizzy Master, however, is actually an Italian multi-effects unit. The pedal\'s wah, tremolo, and fuzz all have their own footswitches, though they are not necessarily intuitively set: "The fuzz switch is located at the bottom of the pedal, while the wah switch is under the heel of the treadle, and the tremolo switch is under the toe," Vintage & Rarities writes. "There is a rate knob for the tremolo at the top of the pedal, while the intensity of the fuzz and the sweep of the wah are controlled with the treadle."', 'Mike "Analog Mike" Piera is a foundational figure in today\'s boutique pedal industry, so it\'s fitting that he has such a foundational pedal in his collection. Vintage & Rarities calls it "the granddaddy of every pedal in this book."', "Originally built in 1937, Epiphone's Rocco Tonexpressor is a combo volume-tone pedal. When used for its original purpose, steel guitar, it gave players a way to change their volume or tone with their feet. By rocking the treadle back and forth, one could change the volume. By rocking it side to side, one could change the tone.", 'Bart Provoost runs the Effects Database, where he runs down info on rare effects and shares it for the world to see. It also offers a nice excuse to add to his personal collection, which numbers more than 1,000. "Because of Effects Database, I’ve always liked to buy as many rare and obscure pedals as I could," he says. "Most of them have been rather cheap, as well."', 'As the only distortion pedal built in East Germany, this effect was the only one of its kind, made in a country that no longer exists. The Trickverzerrer has a buzzsaw tone, which may attract contemporary players. Unfortunately, it uses 5-pin DIN connectors instead of a standard I/O jack.', 'The builder of Jerms pedals (and former guitarist in Built to Spill), Jim Roth has a highly tuned ear for rich fuzz tones, and his collection boasts a deep bench of American and British varieties.', 'This Lectrolab Fuzz Buzz was an early clone of Gibson’s Maestro FZ-1A, using three germanium transistors. "It’s hard to find a Fuzz Buzz these days," Vintage & Rarities writes, "in part because its bakelite housing didn’t hold up against the enthusiastic stomping of garage band guitarists as well as metal would have."', 'JHS\' Josh Scott hardly needs an introduction, but to anyone who\'s missed the walls of pedals behind him on his YouTube videos, you should know: He\'s a completist as much as he\'s a builder. The current count is north of 2,300. "I\'m a bit obsessed," he tells Vintage & Rarities.', 'This DOD Overdrive Preamp is one of the rarest of the bunch—just the 75th DOD ever built. "I tried for years to find one, and I only know of two on Earth, this one included. It’s by definition the rarest pedal in my collection, though it’s only on long-term loan from the owner, who agreed to let me care for it for the purposes of research and history," Scott says. It inspired the far more common Overdrive Preamp/250.', 'One of the most-distinctive looking pedals in the whole book, the Sebatron DDF-100 Dual Dynamic Filter falls more on the "rarities" end of the Vintage & Rarities spectrum.', "Created in the '90s by the pro audio brand, this pedal is one of about 10 or 20 ever made, according to its owner, Taka Tozawa.

The Premier Drum Company in Britain appreciated the special value of its star endorser and spent an unprecedented amount of time and effort crafting the kit, applying the gaudy pictorial finish.", "Keith loved the result and swore his days of smashing gear were over, now that he was almost 21 and all grown up in a band fast becoming an international sensation. Well—actually, no. He kicked Lily off stage nightly in an orgy of violence, which launched The Who's no-limits reputation in America, culminating in that historic TV appearance and explosion that is still shocking to this day.", "Previous generations of American jazz drummers from Sonny Greer (with Duke Ellington) to Louie Bellson had pioneered the use of greatly extended drum kits, and British drummers such as jazzer Eric Delaney and rockers Bobbie Clarke (with Vince Taylor) and Phil Wainman (The Paramounts) played double bass-drums. But generally, the middle-'60s drum set in pop and rock was a staid affair. Drummers were mostly background figures with drum sets to match—the standard four-piece with a couple of cymbals, straight out of the catalogues of the conservative drum manufacturers.", "But Keith had vision. By 1966, his high-profile rival was Cream's Ginger Baker, and although Keith was not in Ginger's class technically, he was desperate to stay ahead in the public eye.", "By effectively joining together two kits, Keith and Ginger doubled their bass drums and toms, so that now they had four toms instead of two. This only spurred Keith to go one better, and within months his Premier Red Glitter kits (he had two, from mid-1966 to mid '67) were fitted with three small toms and three floor toms.", "This setup formed the basis of the Pictures Of Lily kit, which astounded drummers worldwide. No one had seen the like in rock before. It sparked a fashion that would culminate in the truly mega customized sets of future show-offs like Terry Bozzio and Neil Peart. But that's another story.", "Talking Drums, Premier's in-house publication, recounted how Keith asked the firm's promotions manager, Phil Franklin, if Premier could make a special personalized drum finish incorporating pop art designs. The company had worked with its ad agency, Cunningham-Hurst, on the idea of non-standard drum finishes, and Keith's request accelerated their efforts. A prototype was knocked up by Jeff Hurst, at which point Keith asked for additional images representing The Who's next single.", 'Pete Townshend\'s fertile imagination had bemused British pop fans with "I\'m A Boy" and "Happy Jack" that featured eccentric characters way beyond the usual safe and bland images of current pop. Lily was the most audacious so far. Pete was apparently inspired by a vintage pinup picture of Lillie Langtry, a successful actress and a mistress of the future King Edward VII. In 1967, The Who\'s "Pictures Of Lily" was released as a single, in April in Britain and two months later in the US. The Who were getting ever heavier, and Pete described this latest outing as power pop.', 'Keith told Go magazine that the drums took five people six months to complete and cost $5,000, a sum unheard of for a drum kit at the time. The kit comprised two standard 22x14-inch bass drums, three of Premier\'s idiosyncratic 14x8 mounted toms (Premier also made a 12x8, but no 13x9 back then), plus one 16x16 and two 16x18 floor toms. The kit, said Talking Drums, was "hand assembled with designs worked in brilliant fluorescent colours, which when seen under ultraviolet stage lighting have an \'astounding effect.\'"', 'The graphics were slotted between the lug casings and included a risqué nude figure of Lily alternating with either the legend "Keith Moon Patent British Exploding Drummer" enclosing a Union flag or The Who\'s pop-art orange-on-pink 3D logo, with a miniature Keith face and paired cherubs. A similar band logo adorned each of the bass-drum heads.', 'In 1967 Premier was itself undergoing a significant transformation. Premier quoted its drum shell diameters in inches, just like US makers, but they differed slightly from American sizes. Hitherto this wasn\'t a problem, since Premier made its own plastic Everplay drum heads. However, more and more British drummers were swapping to the market-leading American Remo and Ludwig heads, especially now they were touring the States, and not all of these US heads fitted. Premier had little option but to convert to international "standard" diameter shells. This was no small matter, and it took until 1967 to begin the process.', 'In the case of Lily, the 16-inch-diameter floor toms were built with so-called "pre-international" shell diameters. A clue to this is that they have 10 lugs per head, rather than the eight lugs of later floor toms. The small toms and bass drums had eight lugs and, thus, eight panel illustrations. But the ten-lug floor toms necessitated two extra panels, showing Lily\'s face, not seen on the other drums.', 'The twin bass-drums were clamped together by two pairs of horizontally mounted Premier small-tom mounts. Their "disappearing" tube shafts meant the length they protruded could be varied. This allowed the drums to be angled as required, a neat solution that also offered much-needed stabilization. The small-tom mounts themselves were the Rogers Swiv-O-Matics beloved of many \'60s drummers and considered superior to other makes.', 'Spurs were still the old-fashioned short retractable type, and they really were useful only in keeping the drums upright. The bass drums required nails in front to prevent creep—standard practice in 1967.', "Pete Townshend was inspired by a teacher at Ealing Art College, the auto-destructive artist Gustav Metzger, to smash up his gear at the climax of The Who's shows. While this was a semi-serious artistic statement by the deep thinking Pete, it was simply a license to go mad for the creatively destructive Moon.", "Footage of the Smothers Brothers explosion shows that the heads and hoops were blown clean off the left bass drum. In fact, all the Lily bass drums seem to have been lost. (Some later pictures show the Lily toms coupled with the chrome-clad bass drums from Keith's next Premier kit.) Today, London's Victoria and Albert Museum has three small toms, while a couple of floor toms at least have made it to the safety of a private collector.", "It's a tribute to Premier's sturdy build quality that all the surviving drums appear to be in pretty good condition. Roger Horrobin of Premier told me that just two Lily kits were made, marking a considerable investment for the company, although Keith proved oblivious.", "Over the next couple of years following this initial US foray, The Who upped their game in every department, becoming the world's most thrilling live rock group. No longer was there any need to smash up their gear.", 'Premier\'s hardware likewise improved markedly—although Moon\'s kits still required steel reinforcement plates! It\'s tempting to speculate that if Lily had been made a year or two later, when Premier shells accommodated "standard" Remo sizes and the hardware was beefed up, she would have received better treatment, and an entire Lily kit might have survived intact.

Is it electro, techno, left-field experimentalism? Jungle, drum and bass, IDM? Boom bap, trap, drill?", "But while the subgenre names may change through time, a new book argues that it's all really the same thing. And maybe what's most shocking about the claim is that the more you dig into it, the more you believe it.", 'Laurent Fintoni has been writing about the artists that create this music for the better part of two decades, in publications like FACT, The FADER, Bandcamp, and the Red Bull Music Academy. In Bedroom Beats & B-Sides: Instrumental Hip-Hop and Electronic Music at the Turn of the Century, he tracks the rise of the bedroom producer.', 'In doing so, he not only shows the shared equipment, techniques, and inspirations across genre lines—coalescing into a modern global beat scene—but how bedroom production has remade the recording industry in its image.', "The story begins in the wayward labs and studios of rebels and experimentalists, back when the gear was quite a bit larger, and harder to come by: places like the BBC's Radiophonic Workshop, San Francisco's Tape Music Center, and King Tubby's dub studio in Kingston. Where Fintoni's focus primarily resides, however, is in the following generations, those producers who took this early work as inspiration and created their own music—with whatever samplers, synths, and sequencers they could cobble together.", "Hopping in and out of scenes in London, Detroit, New York, Los Angeles, and elsewhere, he follows the developments in sound and style, the cross-pollination between Autechre, Aphex Twin, Madlib, Jay Dee, Prefuse 73, El-P, Sa-Ra, Kanye West, and hundreds more. (A running playlist—Fintoni's soundtracks each chapter—provide aural clues to help readers further connect the dots.)", 'A partnership between Cornwall-based ambient artist Luke Vibert and Jeremy Simmonds (aka Voafose) is representative of the bedroom rigs of the early \'90s. Vibert tells Fintoni, "He had a four-track, I had a keyboard, he had a drum machine, I got a sampler, and we would sort of pool our bits together." Others made tapes with buzzing mixers, borrowed MPCs, or—especially in the case of Madlib—whatever was on hand.', 'Despite the potential of being a lonely pursuit, bedroom production was (and is) often a collaborative affair. Asked if there was more social back in the pre-DAW days than now, Fintoni tells Reverb, "It\'s always required a social component, whether that be pooling resources with others, sharing tips and tricks, performing together, gathering in spaces like record shops, or as we moved into the 2000s gathering online on social networks."', "The equipment available in the '80s, '90s, and early 2000s was of course more limited than today's. Samplers, whether keyboards like the Casio RZ-1, Akai's S-series, or the high-end E-Mu SP-1200, often just a few seconds of sample time.", 'What\'s interesting is how much these limitations have shaped today\'s technology. In the book, when Fintoni writes about the beat scene circa 2008, he says, "Their beats were stylistically loose and slippery, the natural result of more than two decades of evolution that had seen the quirks and limitations of home recording morph into industry standards."', 'How clean is that line of development though?', '"To me, that line of development is quite clear," Fintoni says. "Yes, sampling has become much less limited in its technical aspect (more time, better quality, more ability to manipulate it) but ultimately has remained pretty similar in its aesthetic aspects—it\'s about repurposing something that exists into something new, and whether you\'re using an SP-1200 or an NI Maschine it can have the same emotional impact."', '"As Georgia Anne Muldrow says in the book, there\'s a clear argument for a brand like Native Instruments being able to exist today because of what hip-hop brought to music making in terms of techniques," he says. "Those techniques were developed by subverting equipment to do things it wasn\'t supposed to. And those subversions were turned into standards that most come to expect from their hardware or software, be it EQ\'ing, fading, echo, reverb, etc…"', "By the 2000s, the underground-mainstream divide in the beatmaking world was dissolving, with once-avant garde producers admiring the strange sounds Timbaland was bringing to the top of the charts. By the 2010s, when the dividing line is grayer than ever, you have nominally underground producers like Madlib exerting a huge influence over everyone, whether they're performing on a 404 at a beat night or producing for pop superstars.", 'Ras G, the late beatmaker known for dubby, grimy, neck-breaking beats (courtesy of a 404), is a figure that still looms large in today\'s beat scene and in the pages of Fintoni\'s book. It\'s not only dedicated to him ("For Gregory \'Ras G\' Porter, Airhorn!!") but ends with a personal coda to him, where Fintoni remembers the various bass-heavy sets of Ras\' he heard, the times they met and talked about beats, and the special wisdom Ras imparted.', "But while Ras had a singular spirit, he wasn't alone in his practice. I asked Fintoni about this disappearing line between underground and mainstream beatmaking, and how nominally underground artists like Ras G and chart-toppers like Kenny Beats fall into it now.", '"To use your examples, someone like Ras G on one side and Kenny Beats on the other, who are essentially two manifestations of the same base idea—one practices in what could be considered a more traditionally \'underground\'/independent way and the other in a more industry way, but really they\'re just different sides of the same coin, the tools are similar, the approaches are similar, and the influences/inspirations are likely similar. Or to use the example of Dilla and Madlib, they continue to exert an audible influence on what we might consider the mainstream today."', "It all points back to the central thesis of Fintoni's book, that all the various strands of beat-driven music—whether dance, pop, or hip-hop-oriented—are part of one global beat culture.", '"Beats generate their own cultural velocity and their pace always outruns the capabilities of language, leaving us with a string of words that tend to confine what is possible," he writes near the end of the book. "Beats don\'t discriminate, they don\'t need a category."', 'Instead, he sees them as rhizomes, sampling the term from French philosophers Deleuze and Guattari, as "reducible neither to the One nor the multiple."

With the poly gear Doepfer and others have introduced, electronic musicians can conjure a previously unthinkable amount of magic from polyphony.", "From the time Dr. Moog premiered his first system in 1964 until just a few years ago, modular pretty much meant mono. And even after Doepfer's late-'90s development of the Eurorack system helped to standardize and inspire a whole new generation of modular madness, mono was the way it stayed, unless you were willing to jump through some major hoops. The cost, space, and technical difficulty of managing modular polyphony mostly made it a no-go.", '"The Eurorack was usually a mono endeavor," confirms Tom Butcher, who records under the name Orqid and also runs Seattle electronic music store Patchwerks. "I guess there have been MIDI interfaces that would allow you to do polyphony in a modular and use essentially a voice routing, times however many voices. You pair up your oscillator set with your filters and amplifiers and envelopes and then, however many voices you want you just multiply that out. That was the early way to do that stuff."', 'But even if you were to stubbornly pursue full modular polyphony by creating an unwieldy, prohibitively expensive Frankenstein monster with a separate filter, envelope, VCA, etc. for each voice, it would still be a beast to control. "You have to calibrate all those things," says Butcher. "If you want things to sound pretty smooth and balanced it can be a pain to tune everything up, get the amplifiers right, get all the envelopes the same."', 'For true modular polyphony, only a fully integrated system could circumvent all those issues, which is no snap from an engineering standpoint.', "But through newly created integrated systems and inventive modules that create multiple voices out of lone CV signals, there's been an explosion of multi-voiced Eurorack modules in recent years. More than ever, synthesists can use multiple musical voices in ways that are sometimes paraphonic, sometimes truly polyphonic, and others that challenge or transcend traditional polyphonic designations.", 'Dieter Doepfer, the founder of the company that bears his name, explains just why truly integrated polyphonic systems are so hard to design: "For polyphonic modules all parameters have to be voltage-controlled. Even parameters which are only manually controlled for monophonic modules, like input level, modulation/envelope intensity, envelope parameters ADSR, and so on. This increases the technical complexity noticeably because for each of these parameters a separate VCA is required."', "That's pretty much where we were until a handful of enterprising synth sultans decided to go against the grain.", "One of the most important steps toward a polyphonic future was the creation of multi-voice VCO modules, like Blue Lantern's Poly Phobos, Synthesis Technology's E370, Qu-Bit's Chord, 4MS's Ensemble, the ALM/Busy Circuits Sid Guts Deluxe, Instruo's Troika, Acid Rain Technology's Chainsaw, and Supercritical's Demon Core Oscillator w/ Expander.", 'The Poly Phobos was an early arrival on the scene, appearing in 2017. Blue Lantern founder Flavio Mireles says, "The main obstacle to achieving modular polyphonic products in the past was cost. When I was prototyping the Poly Phobos VCO, I had to lay out the entire circuit: exponential converter, VCO generator, and wave shapers, all of this times four."', 'The small but significant savior that made things easier was a new version of a classic integrated circuit. CoolAudio\'s V3340 is a clone of the classic CEM 3440 VCO chip that pumped rocket fuel into legendary analog synths like the Prophet-5, Jupiter-6, and OB-Xa. "The CoolAudio V3340 IC chip has all of these functions internally," explains Mireles, "So instead of placing, for example, 900 SMT [surface-mount technology] parts on a circuit board, you are only placing a few."', "On the filter side of things, poly-friendly four-channel VCFs like Qu-Bit's Tone and Eowave's Fluctuations Magnetiques have popped up. Rossum's eight-channel Assimil8or sampler and multi-channel MIDI-to-CV interfaces like the Bastl 1983, Analogue Solutions' Polygene, Polyend's Poly, and Mutable Instruments' Yarns opened up the poly possibilities even more. Or, you can use Ableton Live's CV Tools with DC-coupled interface modules like Expert Sleepers' ES-8.", "For all the new avenues these modules made available, what most of them offered wasn't technically considered full polyphony. Many of the VCOs, for example, generate chords controlled by a single trigger, as opposed to individually articulated voices. Make Noise's tELHARMONIC, in one of the more creative approaches to the single-trigger situation, uses additive synthesis to power a multi-voice oscillator inspired by one of the earliest electronic instrument's Thaddeus Cahill's 1890s invention, the Telharmonium.", 'Make Noise founder Tony Rolando explains, "We had this idea that while chords have a tonic and they have an interval, they have a shape, so if we were to give these three parameters voltage control, we could potentially use a three-channel sequencer to create a chord sequence. It\'s three voices, each voice is an additive voice that uses up to 48 sine waves to create the sound."', 'Musicians have found plenty of ways to work with the kind of chordal polyphony offered by VCOs like the tELHARMONIC. "It\'s very popular for making complex drones," says Rolando, "Your harmonics, because they\'re all in tune with each other… they\'re all gonna be related harmonically. So it\'s really great if you want to create a drone that\'s highly melodic. It\'s also good for creating kind of stabby chord progressions. Kind of like when you think about how people play a Farfisa organ; it\'s very staccato, because all the notes sound simultaneously. If you\'ve ever played a polyphonic synthesizer you know that\'s rare. You never hit every note at exactly the same time. Another thing that\'s kind of fun is if you modulate an interval while you have a chord sounding, your chord can morph, and that can be a really beautiful thing."', "As far as filters and other types of modules, a common obstacle to fully workable polyphony was the inability to control multiple channels at once. In the case of Eowave's Fluctuations Magnetiques VCF, you might be able to do so but only have two inputs to work with. And often the modules that were unhampered by any of these constrictions came with a hefty price tag due to the expensive circuitry involved.", 'The word "paraphonic" has arisen as an umbrella term for modular gear that accomplishes anything short of full polyphony. "I totally understand why people want to qualify something as paraphonic versus polyphonic," allows Rolando, "because the sound is pretty different. There\'s something to having multiple VCOs going through multiple filters going through multiple VCAs—that\'s what the polyphonic sound is."', 'Mireles says, "Paraphonic, in my opinion, coming from a business perspective, is a cost-cutting decision. The paraphonic design only requires one set of filter and VCA, while a polyphonic design uses X amount of filters and VCAs to match the VCO count. You also need X amount of envelope generators." Of course, many of the modules that are generally pigeonholed as paraphonic could be part of a true poly system if it were wired up that way, but you\'d still have the aforementioned logistical issues to contend with.', 'The 2018 NAMM show introduced the electronic music community to some tantalizing new ideas for going poly in the modular world. Malekko and Doepfer both debuted integrated systems that allowed players to push their polyphonic desires to the limit and beyond.', 'Malekko unveiled a batch of modules to work in conjunction with its Varigate sequencer, which allows for simultaneous CV and gate outputs. Malekko\'s "ecosystem" includes quad LFO, envelope, and VCA modules, as well as an additional sequencer, the Voltage Block. A VCF module might seem conspicuously absent, but the system still provides plenty of fodder for creative minds.', "Doepfer unveiled quad modules for VCO, VCF, ADSR envelope, and VCA, as well as a polyphonic USB/MIDI-to-CV/gate interface, all designed to work within the context of its A-100 setup. The game-changer here is that all the voices can be controlled either independently or together. So users can achieve the kind of old-school polyphony they'd get on a traditional poly synth or they can explore the outer limits of polyphonic synthesis to their hearts' content.", '"The main difference to monophonic modules," explains Doepfer, "is that the same function—e.g. a filter—is four times available with the same controls for all four sub-units. The main difference to standalone polyphonic synths is the free patching option. You may use the option for an internal pre-patched standard polyphonic synth, for example the classical VCO-VCF-VCA-2xADSR structure. But when the sockets at the front panels are used this internal pre-patching is no longer valid and you may be able to establish very uncommon polyphonic structures."', "Again, the development that made this possible was the reintroduction of those all-important 3340 IC chips. As the old analog-era patents Doug Curtis (who died in 2007) created for Curtis Electromusic expired, the chips were reintroduced in 2016 by OnChip, the company he'd founded in 1988. Clones were created not only by CoolAudio but also Alfa RPAR and Sound Semiconductor. As of September 2020, there's also a brand-new VCO chip, Sound Semiconductor's SS121330, which will give new opportunities for synth designers.", '"It\'s all pretty slim, it takes up less space, it\'s inexpensive, that makes it a little easier," says Tom Butcher about the Doepfer modules. "They\'re purpose-built for polyphony, and because of that, they\'re able to reduce the number of controls… compared to buying eight different envelopes. You can use a single set of controls for eight channels of a VCA for example, and that really helps you out, you don\'t have to spend any time calibrating the amplifiers for each voice. I think there are a small set of people for whom that\'s exactly what they want, and there\'s probably not that much else out there besides those Doepfer modules that will satisfy that."', "It's tempting (and easy) to just use modular poly gear to replicate the things you'd do with a standard polyphonic synth. But there's a far wider world of sounds awaiting those who abandon conventional configurations and think outside the box (literally). For Doepfer, that's exactly why he made his modules.", 'As with modular synthesis itself, the only limits are those of your own imagination. Offering up a mere few options, Doepfer says, "You can, for example, control the CVs for the VCO from a keyboard but the triggers for the envelope generators are generated by a trigger sequencer. Or you may use random sources to control the VCO pitch as well as the gates/trigger. Or you may mix the outputs not to a common signal but to four channels of a quadraphonic system. There are tons of possibilities not possible with monophonic modules or polyphonic stand-alone synths."', 'Viewed from a player\'s perspective, the colors in Eurorack\'s poly paint box seem even more numerous. Discussing some of his own polyphonic preferences, Butcher says, "You can use, say, three different filter types for a triad, and based on how you play and how it cycles through, you might have a different frequency cutoff, maybe one note has resonance, one has a different slope, that can introduce some sequence-like variations in the arpeggio as you play. You can be choosing from several different filters all in one ensemble voice."', 'Playing chords through a polyphonic MIDI interface can introduce even more fascinating twists to the process. "That\'s one of the things that you get out of Eurorack polyphony that you won\'t get out of almost all true poly synths," says Butcher. "I could have one oscillator that\'s analog, another voice that\'s like a wavetable module, another maybe a sampler, so that can get pretty fun."', "Even the most basic building blocks of music itself are up for grabs if you're feeling adventurous enough.", '"Once the oscillators tune out from each other," explains Butcher, "playing polyphony with the keyboard gives you these blue notes. Sometimes you\'ll get these microtonal shifts because it\'s not locked in a chromatic scale. That, for me, introduces a lot of interesting emotions, you can get an eerie or ethereal sound, and usually you can\'t tell when you\'re playing which notes will come out blue, just because you\'re not thinking of how the voices are allocated from the chord into the individual routing."', 'Despite the promise of a bright multi-voice future hovering within easy reach, some Eurorack users remain leery of leaping into the poly pool, opting instead to stick with their tried-and-true mono modules. Even Robert Fantinatto, who documented the modular renaissance in his 2014 film I Dream of Wires and did as much as anyone to spread the word about the Eurorack universe, resides in this camp.', '"I tend to agree with Bob Moog and his reluctance to do too much in the way of polyphonic synthesizers," avers Fantinatto. "Frequency modulation and other effects tend to get very muddy when you have multiple notes, and the true power of a synthesized sound I feel is best expressed monophonically. I\'d be more inclined to recommend a keyboard-based solution rather than modular for polyphonic sounds, as you\'d likely not be needing so much modulation flexibility when creating typical harmonies. But of course it all depends on your application."', 'Even manufacturers of poly products can sometimes be circumspect on the subject. Flavio Mireles says, "My general feel about the polyphonic modular market is that it is not in high demand. I am referring to individual poly products like four-voice ADSR, four-voice VCF. You need so many patch cables just to pass the signals over the next module. I believe polyphonic completed products, which contain everything but can be installed on the Euro rack would become more popular."', 'Doepfer himself, having created exactly the kind of system Mireles is talking about, knows better than anybody about the obstacles to true polyphony that existed until recently. "I think the main shortcomings were the many patch cables that were required for the first production series of the polyphonic modules," he says, "as these did not yet feature the internal pre-patching possibilities. I did a polyphonic modular synth many years ago. It was available only as a kit and suffered from the lack of the integrated circuits which are available today."', 'Now that the technology is in place, one of the main challenges for makers of polyphonic modules seems to be spreading the word to a wider audience, since Eurorack users have become so accustomed to occupying a mono world. And for some, poly gear is still seen as an extravagance. "Most people that we find coming into our shop," says Tom Butcher, "they just want to experiment with sound and they don\'t get into polyphony until later."', 'With tons of room for growth, the poly modular market is bound to keep getting bigger. More products are certain to come and some are already in the works. "I\'m actually prototyping another polyphonic VCO at the moment," reports Mireles, "with more wave shapes… I don\'t expect it to be hot seller, I just want to see how it goes." And 2020 has already brought a surge of new gear, from Qu-Bit\'s eight-voice physical modeling module Surface to Cherry Audio\'s Voltage Modular 2 system and Tubbutec\'s µTune quantizer/midi-to-CV interface.', 'Tom Butcher feels that interest in polyphony in the Eurorack universe is a flame just waiting to be fanned.', '"I think there\'s a hunger and a desire to figure that out," he says. "It might need more education in the market to say, \'This is how you do it,\' to show people how to get from where they are to the first few steps. Using something like the Rossum Assimil8or sampler, it\'s got eight channels and one output, so you can get polyphony on that or you can treat it as your drum kit and your bass line. That\'s kind of a good stepping stone to polyphony. Maybe that\'s what leads into the Doepfer polyphonic stuff."', 'The need for more education on the nuts and bolts of polyphony is an opportunity in waiting. But the man who\'s at the bleeding edge of the movement is the most reluctant to make predictions. "About 10 years ago I already supposed that the peak of the Eurorack boom is probably reached," confesses Doepfer. "I was totally wrong." But don\'t let Doepfer\'s humility distract from the facts—now that the poly modular genie is out of the bottle, it won\'t be going in again.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Designed as solo melody devices to be attached to a piano or organ, they were the first mass-produced and widely used electronic instruments. And while they lack the cultish aura of the Theremin, the Ondes Martenot, or the Ondioline, they introduced the possibilities of electronic musical instruments to tens of thousands of musicians and millions of listeners.', 'In 1939, Hammond launched the Novachord, a polyphonic electronic keyboard that\'s a legitimate contender for the "first synth" title. Built into a walnut case, it weighed 500 pounds and looked like a harmonium crossed with a grand piano. It was expensive, complex to maintain, and hard to play. Though admired for its sounds, only about 1,000 were sold before production stopped in 1942.', "It's an intriguing proposition, mentioned here because it lent some technology to the Hammond Solovox, the first in a series of instruments sometimes described as piano attachments.", 'The Solovox was launched in 1940. Production was suspended in 1941, to run again from 1946 to 1950. Although the Solovox shared Novachord technology, it introduced the idea of the piano attachment, a different concept altogether. In common with all subsequent piano attachments, it has two main components.', 'First, a three-octave monophonic electronic keyboard, designed to fit underneath a piano or organ keyboard. Second, a "tone cabinet"—a combo amp. A knee-operated volume/expression lever was another feature copied in later, similar instruments. The idea was that you\'d play Solovox melodies with your right hand, leaving the left free to play chordal accompaniment on the host instrument.', "The Solovox's keys are smaller than a piano's, and that, along with the chunky rocker switches that select the Solovox's various sounds, lends the unit something of the appearance of an accordion. These features survived in subsequent instruments, too.", 'The Solovox was aimed at the popular and home musician—an instrument for dance halls, supper clubs, and living rooms. Though production didn\'t survive into the rock \'n\' roll era, you can hear one on "Sugar Shack" (1963) by Jimmy Gilmer and The Fireballs. By that time, the Solovox had long since given way to another piano attachment that had a distinct advantage over Hammond\'s instrument.', "The Clavioline was designed in 1947 by a Frenchman, Constant Martin (1910–95). Martin also built church organs, and he was responsible for the electronic bells in the city hall that sounded the liberation of Versailles in 1944. He licensed widely the manufacturing rights to his Clavioline, notably to Gibson and its parent company Chicago Musical Instrument (USA), Selmer (France and the UK), Jörgensen-Electronic (Germany), and Farfisa (Italy). Made in the tens of thousands, Claviolines were produced well into the '60s.", 'Like the Solovox, the Clavioline comprises a three-octave monophonic keyboard with under-sized keys, a combo amp, and a knee-operated volume control. The difference is that the keyboard packs into the back of the combo, making a single portable unit.', 'Max Crook, Del Shannon\'s keyboard player, was like many musicians who found this feature persuasive. He had considered a Solovox, but he told me the instrument was "very heavy, not to mention awkward to carry." You could pick up the Clavioline with one hand—just—and put it in the trunk of your car. More of Max Crook shortly.', 'Though visually similar, the Clavioline\'s keyboard includes another advance on the Solovox: a sliding switch that transposes the whole instrument an octave either way, giving it five octaves. In its day, the Clavioline was admired for its ability to mimic conventional instruments. Ads claimed it could reproduce "with amazing fidelity the tonal quality of more than 30 different musical instruments." The contemporary listener might beg to differ, although the alternately buzzy, droning, whistling tones retain a charm.', 'The Selmer Clavioline launched in 1950, with Gibson\'s appearing at 1952\'s NAMM trade show, where footage of it was broadcast daily over a closed television circuit. Both companies promoted Claviolines for domestic use, with ads showing genteel ladies at the home piano thrilled to "have a full orchestra at [their] fingertips."', 'It was working popular musicians who embraced the instrument. In the UK in particular, the Clavioline caught on. It dominated "Little Red Monkey" (1953) by Frank Chacksfield\'s Tunesmiths, thought to be the first British hit to use an electronic instrument. The John Barry Seven, an early vehicle for the film composer John Barry, used a Clavioline on their only album, Stringbeat (1961). In the USA, the Clavioline had a lower profile, until that same year when Del Shannon\'s "Runaway" was an international hit.', 'Written by Shannon and Max Crook, "Runaway" is now so familiar that any sense of its originality is lost. But it is an unusual record, with its minor to major key shift and the absence of a conventional repeated verse–chorus structure. And there\'s the instrumental break, taking up more than a fifth of the song, played by Crook on his Musitron—a contraction of music and electron—which was, in fact, a modified Clavioline.', 'Crook had bought a standard Gibson instrument in a pawnshop, disposed of the combo, and built up the Musitron. First he modified the keyboard by "putting in pots and resistors and switches into the circuit to make changes," he told me, which enhanced the instrument\'s range, "right up to where the dogs and cats are screaming."', "He added a pitchbend by attaching a spring-loaded mechanical lever to the keyboard's tuning pots. He then fed the modified keyboard through a sequence of home-made echo, reverb, and vibrato units into a more powerful amplifier. The Musitron also featured on subsequent Shannon hits, but Crook did not continue in music full-time. He kept the Musitron, though, and used it at Shannon tribute events and nostalgia-circuit gigs well into this century. He died in July 2020.", 'Back in the UK, the rogue producer Joe Meek had used Claviolines since the late \'50s. Of all his productions, the instrument is most associated with The Tornados\' international hit "Telstar" (1962). This prompted a brief revival of a quaint advertising war that had taken place in the British music press in the mid \'50s.', "When Selmer's Clavioline went on sale in Britain, Tom Jennings, whose company Jennings Musical Instruments produced accordions, was interested. He designed an instrument that conceptually was all but identical, but with enough circuit changes to ensure that it wouldn't infringe the Clavioline's patent, and he launched the Jennings Univox in 1952.", "Cosmetically, little distinguishes a Univox from a Clavioline. There's the three-octave monophonic keyboard, extendable to five, the volume knee-lever, and the combo amp, all packable together into one handy case. Initially, the Univox was supplied with clips to fasten it under a piano keyboard, like the Clavioline and Solovox before it. Later, a stand was offered so the Univox could be mounted on its own. Claviolines soon had their own stands, too.", 'From about 1953 to 1956, Selmer and Jennings posted ads quoting celebrity musicians eulogizing their instruments over other "similar products." The Univox was cheaper than the Clavioline at about 75 guineas (£81.15, or $230 then) compared to 125 guineas (£135.25, around $380 then) for the top of the range Selmer (Gibson launched its model at $395, about £140 then), but it was the Selmer that prevailed. Jennings was barely promoting its Univox by the late \'50s. That is, until "Telstar" in 1962.', 'Although most authorities insist that Meek used Claviolines to create the melody line, Jennings ran a Univox ad in 1962—the firm\'s first for a while—claiming that the Univox was the "Telstar" sound. Who knows? Records of an auction of Meek\'s equipment after his death show that he owned a Clavioline and a Univox.', '"Telstar" and "Runaway" marked the Clavioline\'s zenith, although the instruments continued to turn up in all sorts of music for years. John Barry and Sergio Leone used them in film scores. Sun Ra used one on his space-jazz freak-outs until he acquired a Minimoog. John Lennon is said to have rolled an orange up and down a Clavioline keyboard on "Baby You\'re A Rich Man."', "Apart from the big three—Solovox, Clavioline, Univox—there were other piano attachments, including the Lipp Pianoline, the Ondiola, and the Hohner Electronium Pi. The Maestrovox was another British instrument, appearing in 1953, and a deluxe version, the Orchestrain, took the concept to its logical extreme. The electronics were attached directly to the host piano's keys so that playing the piano triggered Maestrovox sounds. It doesn't seem to have caught on.", "Selmer's last Clavioline appeared in 1964—just the keyboard unit, to plug into any amplifier. Gibson had given up by then. Jörgensen was still promoting its Claviolines in 1965, but the game was almost up. The Minimoog was only a few years away.", 'Claviolines were consigned to cellars, attics, and garages, or just chucked away. They and other similar instruments turn up for sale quite regularly now—invariably described as "requiring restoration" or something similar. You might find it\'s worth the effort, and agree with Vangelis, who as late as 1974 told Sounds that his Clavioline was "a very old thing … but it\'s beautiful … it can give you many, many things."', 'About the author: Mark Brend is an author and a musician. His books The Sound Of Tomorrow (Bloomsbury 2012) and Strange Sounds (Backbeat 2005) explore early electronic music and musical instruments. He lives in Devon, England.

(Bombs Over Baghdad)," "Ms. Jackson," and "So Fresh, So Clean."', 'Those who bought the album (525,000 in its first week)—or downloaded the leaked version two months before its official release—were rewarded with an hour-plus of funk, psychedelia, electronica, and rock all combined into a hip-hop classic. It was a rare breed, an instant smash commercially and critically whose allure has only continued to grow.', '"Stankonia" as a concept was coined by André 3000 to give a name to the group\'s free-wheeling mindset, a funky utopian headspace where anything and everything is allowed. Stankonia Studios, which André and Big Boi built just before starting work on the record, was where that freedom reigned supreme.', 'For a year, André, Big Boi, and co-producer Mr. DJ were let loose in a studio of their dreams, bringing together all of their influences, tastes, and more than 30 musicians and guest performers. The resulting album was the neon fruit on the vine.', "Following 1998's Aquemini, André and Big Boi had money in the bank and wanted to make good on their desire to have a large studio of their own. Incidentally, they got a chance to buy one of the first professional studios they'd ever set foot in.", "Bobby Brown's Bosstown Recording Studios had been a hotbed of recording in Atlanta, with Whitney Houston, TLC, and others making records there after Brown bought the facility in 1991. (Before Brown's time, the building housed the rock-oriented Soundscape Studios.)", 'Outkast got a chance to record there briefly during the creation of their first record, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik. Having only made music up to that point in the appropriately named Dungeon, the basement studio of production team Organized Noize, Bosstown made an impression.', 'In a mini-documentary on Stankonia, André said: "This was the first, like, real studio we came to. We came in here and our mouths were like, ahh, open, like, \'Oh man, look at this.\' We were trippin\'."', "By the late '90s, Brown had lost Bosstown to foreclosure. Most of the equipment that had wowed André and Big Boi was gone. They bought the studio in 1999 and with the help of John Frye—who had met the duo when they were recording a verse at Bosstown for TLC at Bosstown—outfitted the rooms once again.", 'Frye told Sound on Sound in 2004:', '"When we came in there wasn\'t much left gear-wise. There was the SSL G-series console, and I refurbished it. I put in all new bussing and new EQs. I changed everything here [in the A room]. I redid all the wiring, bought new Studer A827s and an A820 half-inch, and really got Outkast set up with all the gear they needed to have and wouldn\'t want for anything. I put in Augsperger monitors with TAD components and Bryston amplification, and that seemed to be a great system for us. It\'s not the most high-fidelity system but it\'s a good marriage for the power and the drive and volume that we put through it."', 'They recorded Stankonia right on the precipice of the digital takeover. They had one small room set up with a Pro Tools rig, but otherwise it was an analog and tape affair. (By Speakerboxxx/A Love Below the balance shifted toward Pro Tools.)', 'The studio houses a cavernous "warehouse-like space" they\'d use for a live room, according to SOS, "so large, in fact, that huge pieces of stage gear from previous Outkast shows share the space."', 'More than the physical space itself, owning the studio gave the group the freedom to record whenever inspiration struck. As Big Boi said in MTV News\' Stankonia doc, "When you own the joint, you can stay here all day. Because you never know when the vibe\'s gonna come. It could be seven in the morning. It could be seven at night. It could be midnight, you know what I mean. So I was sleeping with the music."', "And like other artists before them who got or fashioned their own keys to the sonic kingdom—Hendrix at his own Electric Lady or Sly Stone's mobile rig for There's a Riot Goin' On—having their own studio let Outkast lean into their creativity.", 'The production team that had first taken Outkast under their wings, Organized Noize, developed a signature sound by blending live instruments and drum machines. While they still appeared on Stankonia, producing three of its 16 songs, the rest of the record is the sound of their proteges taking the lead.', "André, Big Boi, and Mr. DJ (who had DJ'd with the band while they were still teens before moving into production), started with the same sonic template: an SP-1200 and MPC3000 for beats, and a revolving array of synths, guitars, and other instruments. As they had on previous records, Outkast sampled very rarely, preferring instead to craft their own sounds.", '"There’s a closed-mindedness in hip-hop; once people get a set formula, and it works for ‘em…. It’s like being in school: If you’re passing with a B, then why try to get an A?," Big Boi told Spin in 2000. "Everybody samples, but there’s a lot of not-so-creative sampling out there. When we sample, we sample for the sounds, not for the structure of the whole damn song. It’s about being creative."', 'For Stankonia, they used the wealth of local Atlanta musicians, inviting them into the studio for extended jam sessions.', "In an interview with Alpha & Omega around the album's release, Mr. DJ said:", '"We really go out and get the old school live players from all the city. Sometimes we go to clubs and watch the bands play and we\'ll pick out who we want to play for us... Of course we got people that we always use... And we just all hookup and have big vibe sessions. We use beat machines just to get the rhythm going.. then we sit around, smoke a few, drink a few.. Is this for the kids?.. (laughter)... We just basically get a vibe going.. Sometimes it\'s good and sometimes it ain\'t so good. Whatever sounds the best."', "Throughout the entire making of the album, Outkast was steeping itself ever-deeper into their favorite music of the past. André wanted the guitar sounds of Funkadelic's Eddie Hazel, a longtime inspiration, or James Brown's guitarist Jimmy Nolen, who was suggested to André by Jimi Hendrix in a dream, or so he told Knox Robinson in his The Fader cover story at the album's release.", 'In a separate profile with Spin, Big Boi listed the artists he was taking inspiration from at the time: "Gil Scott-Heron, Minnie Riperton, James Brown, Parliament-Funkadelic, Led Zeppelin, the Doors, Kate Bush—I go deep into her music."', 'What was new to them was rave music, but that too got thrown into the mix. Mr. DJ said, "Me and Dré went to a rave and we were listening to the music that people were dancing to and we were amazed how many people were in there... It was inside a big church and there were like thousands of people... A lot of white kids.. and they were out there jammin\'... We noticed that there was a whole crowd of people that we were not reaching.. While we were there, a lot of people new who Dré was and knew what it was going.. So we were like, \'We gotta make some music for them.\'" So definitely, we listen to all types of music."', 'Dré explained his own take on it to Spin: "I like the tempo more than anything. Some of the music be wack; most of the music be wack—they be in there trippin’. (Laughs) It’s just too repetitious for me. When you’re on that dope, it just feels good, I guess."', "All the same, they took a drum and bass rhythm for the album's lead single.", 'Recalling the creation of the song to The Boston Globe, Big Boi said he came back to the studio to find André putting synths on top of a 154 bpm beat.', '"I walked into the room, and it’s like the room was glowing. It was crazy," Big Boi said. Lift-off was achieved. Big Boi added a verse to the one André had already made, then took it back to his kids to see what they thought. "They were going crazy," he said. "So I called Dré and I said, \'I think we got one.\'"', '"Bombs Over Baghdad" blew up as soon as it was released. With its technicolor video and relentless rhythm, it was unlike anything else at the time. The followup, "Ms. Jackson," was an even bigger hit. It too was the result of a glowing session, according to Big Boi.', '"It was storming raining," Big Boi told The Boston Globe. They invited bassist Aaron Mills to add to the track. "And he got to thumping that bass, man. The room started glowing again. After that moment, I knew that this was the place where I was going to always record at."', "For Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, Outkast updated Stankonia, but thanks to their growing fame and busy schedules, it was a more fractured affair: André recorded portions at his home in LA, and eventually spread to other places, including Stankonia. The much-discussed fracturing of the duo's creative partnership eventually hit the studio too.", 'Though André sold his share of the studio to Big Boi in 2015, Stankonia has remained his home base, and has been used by T.I., Ludacris, Lil’ John, and plenty of other artists over the last two decades.', 'As Big Boi told The Boston Globe, "A lot of good music came out of there.

"It was just a monophonic keyboard, so you couldn\'t even play chords on it. I would sit for hours on that MS-10 just making sounds… I had a great time."', "Known as the little brother of the then-underappreciated, now-iconic MS-20, the MS-10 was part of Korg's legendary 1978 MS Series—an entry-level, compact, 32-key semi-modular analog synth originally released for less than half the price of the Minimoog.", 'Though it had only one VCO, a single LFO with one default triangle wave, and a single envelope generator, its patch bay allowed for an array of otherworldly sound combinations.', "Another notable factor of the MS-10 was its cool, impeccable design, as well as its rich percussive sounds and window-rattling basslines. While it didn't have the MS-20's unique external signal processor, the MS-10 had an external input to filter, meaning anything from electric guitars to vocals could be fed through it to craft unique sounds. Unlike the MS-20, the MS-10 had pulse width modulation.", 'A filter sweep of its noise generator created intergalactic frequencies reminiscent of windstorms on Mars.', 'In an early interview with Korg, Atkins explained, "What defined my sound is that I would make total electronic productions. I would take the MS-10 and make drum sounds out of a closed filter with gated noise and some kick drums and high hat sounds, on-and-off, all off of the MS-10. I would make a whole drum kit just based off gated noise and filtered noise, and build up these arrangements… they were totally done on this one synthesizer. The sound was amazing."', 'The sonic possibilities of the MS-10 were so moving to the young Atkins that he credited the synth with having helped develop his style even before he heard Kraftwerk, who quickly became one of his greatest influences.', 'Of the countless days and hours in high school he spent learning, experimenting, and getting lost in the myriad of futuristic sounds on the MS-10, Atkins said, "In my entire life, entire career, [my work on this Korg MS-10] was the most productive period."', 'Using two cassette tape decks and a PA mixer, Atkins began recording demo tapes of full songs he had created with the MS-10. The songs were, in his words, "out there."', 'By then he was 18, and, having recently graduated from Belleville High School, he brought the demo tapes to one of his music classes at Washtenaw Community College in Ann Arbor.', '"Everybody in the class loved these demos," said Atkins in Jacqueline Caux\'s 2017 documentary Never Stop: A Music that Resists. "And everybody wanted to hook up with me because of that."', "The demos caught the attention of Atkins' classmate and fellow outlier synth enthusiast Rik Davis, with whom he would create what many regard as the world's first techno (or at least 'proto-techno') songs under the name Cybotron.", "Davis was a private person, a Vietnam vet then in his late '20s who had suffered greatly from the ravages of the Vietnam War, and from Detroit's racist urban renewal policies. He was from Black Bottom, a once predominantly African American neighborhood in Detroit that had been entirely demolished to make room for a freeway.", "Upon returning home after the War, Davis found he had nothing to return to. Detroit was economically depressed and racially divided, and every home he had lived in as a child was gone. He dedicated himself to music as a source of catharsis and social commentary, and much of his perspectives and experiences worked their way thematically into Cybotron's tracks.", 'Although 10 years older than Atkins, Davis shared a visionary love of electronic instruments, sci-fi, and futurism. His favorite bands were Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Morton Subotnik, Giorgio Moroder, Ultravox, and Tangerine Dream.', 'As Atkins told Spin, when he first visited Davis\' house in Ypsilanti, he felt like he had entered a spacecraft. "It was during the day, but it was dark— the blinds were closed. The only lights you could see were coming from the keyboards. It wasn\'t really consumer gear—the stuff you could see anywhere. They had these LEDs. It looked like an airplane cockpit."', "While it's possible Davis had rare studio equipment, Cybotron's earliest recordings were created using at least some consumer gear: Davis' 1975 ARP Axxe, his then-newly purchased ARP Odyssey (though which revision of the Odyssey he owned is unclear), a Korg vocoder (presumably a Korg VC-10, as this would have been the only Korg vocoder available at the time), a DR-55 drum machine, and a TR-808.", 'Cybotron began recording and self-releasing their first two songs, "Cosmic Raindance" and the dystopian single "Alleys of Your Mind," in 1981. The soulful, wailing electro-instrumental "Cosmic Raindance" was, in Davis\' words, just him "noodling around" on his ARP Axxe, while "Alleys of your Mind," considered by many to be the world\'s first techno song, was, according to an interview from The Red Bull Music Academy, written by Davis with Atkins lending vocals, and featured an ARP Odyssey.', 'Originally released in 1972 and having gone through two revisions until 1978, the legendary two-oscillator Odyssey was a more portable, performance-friendly version of the famed ARP 2600, and was a direct competitor of the Minimoog.', 'It was one of the first analog synths with duophonic capabilities, and was a favorite of Herbie Hancock for its design, playability, and signature "ARP sound."', 'Later versions of the Odyssey—the MKII and MKIII—also had pressure-sensitive Proportional Pitch Controller buttons, which, for many musicians, made pitch bending easier, and gave the Odyssey a unique vibrato.', 'Just as the Odyssey was a scaled-down version of the 2600, the Axxe was a scaled-down version of the Odyssey.', 'By the time he began working with Atkins, Davis had already purchased an ARP Axxe after being inspired by the soundtrack for Dario Argento\'s 1977 horror classic Suspiria, and had used the Axxe to produce his first record, 1978\'s "Methane Sea"—a fizzling primordial psychedelic electro song that a famous DJ, The Electrifying Mojo, had used as an opener for his hugely influential radio show, The Midnight Funk Association.', 'Like the Korg MS-10, the ARP Axxe was a one-VCO, "budget-friendly," monophonic analog synth still capable of fantastic sounds. Although the Axxe had fewer features than the Odyssey, the Axxe\'s single-oscillator saw and pulse waveforms could be used simultaneously to create the feel of a dual VCO.', 'As for percussion, it\'s likely both "Cosmic Raindance" and "Alleys of Your Mind" featured one of Atkins\' favorite drum machines, the classic analog Boss Dr. Rhythm DR-55.', "Released in 1980, the DR-55 only had four voices—nare, kick, rim shot and hi-hat—but it was important for being one of the first step-write-style programmable drum machines, and for being extremely easy to use. The DR-55 had 16-step drum patterns and an additional two 12-step patterns, which allowed for 3/4 and 6/8 rhythms. (It was also a favorite of New Order, who used it on 1981's Truth.)", 'After The Electrifying Mojo began playing "Alleys of Your Mind" on Detroit airwaves, Cybotron became a success, releasing three more iconic singles, 1982\'s "Cosmic Cars" (which bumped Prince\'s "Little Red Corvette" down to #2 on a Detroit local chart), the iconic hit "Clear" (later sampled by Missy Elliot), and 1984\'s classic "Techno City."', "Atkins left the group in 1984 because of creative differences, and went on to form Model 500 and Metroplex Records, releasing several songs that solidified him as a techno pioneer, while Davis remained in Michigan, eventually releasing two more Cybotron albums, 1993's Empathy and 1995's Cyber Ghetto, fulfilling the band's contract with Fantasy Records.", "It wouldn't be until 2019 that Cybotron would play its first-ever live show—this time with Atkins as the only original member.", '"If you come to see my live shows, you\'ll see that now I\'m using a Novation," Atkins told Attack Magazine. "It\'s a new keyboard and it\'s got some good sounds, is easy to get around, plus it\'s got a vocoder on it."', '"Other than this, I\'ve been getting into a lot of virtual gear, plugins...

This is the legendary sunburst model made between 1958 and 1960, the one used by icons such as Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, and Jeff Beck in earlier decades, and the type that regularly sells for eye-watering sums among today's cognoscenti.", "Changes in fashion among guitar players and guitar makers did not help Gibson during the '80s, and some of those key musicians allied to the original Les Paul moved to other models. At a charity benefit show in London in 1983, that trio of icons played together on stage. Jeff played Fender Stratocasters. Eric, too, played a Strat and, for one song, a Gibson Firebird. Jimmy mainly played a Fender Telecaster, although he did use a Burst briefly. A few years later, Jeff and Eric each worked with Fender to develop a signature model.", "All told, Gibson had a tough time in the '80s, with sales falling by 30 percent in 1982 alone. The US guitar market was tumbling, and most American brands faced similar woes. Costs were high, economic circumstances and currency fluctuations were against them, and Japanese competitors had an edge.", "Since 1980, all the main Gibson production happened at its Nashville plant, while the smaller original Kalamazoo factory now made custom orders, banjos, and mandolins. In 1983, Gibson announced that Kalamazoo would close. The final production was in June '84, and the factory shut down three months later, a little more than 65 years since Gibson erected the original building. In the summer of '85, owner Norlin announced it had found a buyer for Gibson, and in January the following year, Henry Juszkiewicz, David Berryman, and Gary Zebrowski completed their purchase for $5 million.", "Aside from those older players' interest in guitars other than Les Pauls, many of the newer high-octane players of the '80s who might otherwise have been naturals for a Lester also turned to something that suited them better. Superstrats dominated the look and feel of rock guitars in the '80s as several brands—among them Kramer and Jackson—developed and revamped the Stratocaster design to suit the needs of extreme-rock players. Traditional designs such as the Les Paul and indeed the Strat took a beating at the hands of the superstrats, especially when the biggest name of the era, Eddie Van Halen, endorsed Kramer's offerings.", "Superstrats offered more frets, deeper cutaways, modified pickup layouts, high-performance vibrato systems, and bright graphic finishes. In many ways, they were the antithesis of a Les Paul Burst, and they came to define the mainstream rock guitar of the '80s.", "Gibson tried to catch up with its own superstrat-flavored offerings—such as the MV Victory models (1981), Q models (1985), US-1 (1986), U-2/Mach II (1987), and SR-71 (1987)—but while there were some interesting guitars among them, at the time they failed to grab mainstream attention, not least because of a problem that's never been far from the company's door. Some guitarists prefer Gibson to concentrate on old designs from the '50s and '60s, and if it tries to innovate or run with new trends, they consider that as simply too un-Gibson.", 'There were exceptions, of course. For Burst aficionados, the real thing never went out of fashion, despite the apparent dip in visibility among name players. For believers, it was still the most important guitar in the world.', "Joe Walsh, for example. He'd joined the Eagles in time for their massive Hotel California album of 1976, stayed until they disbanded in the early '80s, and would return for various reunions. By the late '80s, Joe still defined his favorite setup as a pair of Fender Super Reverbs and a vintage Les Paul.", "This Is Spinal Tap put many of rock's excesses into comical perspective when it first hit cinema screens in 1984, and a backstage scene where Tap guitarist Nigel Tufnel guides the rockumentary host Marty DiBergi through his guitar collection had a special resonance for Burst nuts.", '"This is the top of the heap," Nigel tells Marty as he picks up a lovely \'59 Burst, adding proudly: "Look at the flame on that one!" The \'59 in the Spinal Tap scene was loaned for the movie by vintage dealer Norman\'s Rare Guitars, and it had appeared a little earlier in a JBL speakers ad.', 'Toto guitarist and famed session player Steve Lukather has a \'59 Burst that served him well throughout his career, and it\'s known as the Rosanna Burst for its appearance in the video for "Rosanna," a big hit for Toto in 1982. Perhaps its most famous appearance came that same year as The Other Guitar on Michael Jackson\'s "Beat It." Steve used his Burst for every guitar heard on the track—except Eddie Van Halen\'s superstrat solo—including the simple, effective bass part, the layered riffs, the rhythm parts, and the backdrop to That Solo.', "These and others constituted a few Burst moments that helped the model's aficionados brave the otherwise rather bleak '80s. But among all the decade's shred players lining up for their gleaming new superstrats, it took Guns N' Roses to come along and redefine hard rock—and, no doubt to Gibson's delight, guitarist Slash used a Les Paul to unleash his aggressive, bluesy licks.", 'Slash was inspired by his heroes Jimmy Page and Joe Perry and the Les Pauls they played. Guns N\' Roses began to sell millions of albums, starting with 1987\'s Appetite For Destruction, and Slash began to assemble a fine guitar collection, with a good showing of vintage Les Pauls. But the ones he used at first were replicas. He\'d started out in Guns N\' Roses with a B.C. Rich, a Jackson, an SG—but in \'85 he got his first good Les Paul, which was built not by Gibson but by Peter "Max" Baranet or by Kris Derrig, depending on which story you believe.', 'Slash disposed of that guitar, but by summer \'86 he needed something to record basic tracks for Appetite. The identity of this second replica is also disputed. Slash said it was a Les Paul made by Derrig. Max Baranet told me it was another of his guitars. "He got my personal 1960 replica directly from me two days before recording sessions started," Max said, "and then a third replica, a Kris Derrig, for two days of overdubs after the album had been recorded."', 'When Gibson did a deal with Slash soon afterward for two new Les Paul Standards, Slash put away his road-worn replicas. But the irony remains: the guitars that more or less brought the Burst back to mainstream public consciousness weren\'t made by Gibson. Layering up the irony still further, in 2010 Gibson produced the Slash "Appetite For Destruction" Les Paul. It was a re-creation of a replica.', 'Meanwhile, Gibson had been tracing the rise of interest in the Burst through the \'70s and had come to realize that a modern reissue might be a good idea. The first convincing signs of this were the Heritage Series Standard-80 models, launched in 1980, and Gibson\'s "Reissue Outfits," effectively an attempt to echo more accurately the old-style Burst and Goldtop, introduced three years later and driven by demand from customers who wanted the features of those hallowed \'50s models.', 'J.T. Riboloff joined Gibson in \'87. "When I went there," he told me, "the Les Paul reissue was basically a regular Standard with a flame top. Slowly but surely, they let us get away with a little more." One of J.T.\'s early projects was the Les Paul Classic of 1989, which hinted at the features of a \'60 Burst, although the pickups were definitely modern.', "Thankfully for the Burst, the '80s were over—and a few years later, in 1991, Gibson revised its regular reissue into two models, effectively the Standard '59 Flametop Reissue and the Standard '60 Flametop Reissue. With that move, Gibson's strategy for a series of serious reissue Les Pauls was under way, and the Burst was set to enjoy its split personality as an original high-value collectable and a finely engineered modern re-creation.", 'About the Author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

When the war ended, he set out to capture this phenomenon for musical use. In the process, Martenot created one of the first electronic musical instruments, and one that is still in use today.', 'In 1928, the same year Leon Theremin patented the theremin in New York, Martenot unveiled his invention in Paris. A report in The Guardian that year declared Martenot had "decidedly improved upon the invention which Professor Leo Theremin introduced here [in the UK] last December."', 'From the start, Martenot presented what he first called the Ondes Musicales (meaning "musical waves") and later the Ondes Martenot ("Martenot’s waves") as a new orchestral instrument. He went on an international publicity tour and performed on US radio, including a rendition of Edvard Greig’s "Anita’s Dance" from Peer Gynt Suite No. 1.', 'A preview of the event in The New York Times in 1930 described "the musical instrument of the future" that could "mimic almost every known instrument in an orchestra." Martenot, though, asserted that his primary aim was "not to imitate the sounds of other instruments, but to provide new resources of expression for composers and novel color effects to enrich the orchestral palette."', 'The theremin and the Ondes Martenot both use heterodyne sound production technology—the mixing of frequencies—and both excel at sweeping, swerving portamentos. But there the similarity ends.', 'Martenot developed his instruments through several prototypes before going into limited production in 1932. This first model and all subsequent ones are monophonic, and feature two ways of pitching notes: a ribbon controller for portamentos and a piano-style keyboard. The keyboard itself allows some lateral movement—moving a finger from side to side while depressing a key produces vibrato. Such versatility, along with a battery of articulation controls and multiple speakers (diffusers), each producing different timbres, makes the Ondes Martenot an extraordinarily expressive instrument.', 'A Pathé newsreel film from 1934 features Martenot himself demonstrating all of this: "A real musical instrument without string or wind … it’s not necessary to touch the keyboard," and here he demonstrates the ribbon controller, "but if you like you can play on the keys," and he plays the keyboard.', 'Martenot pitched his instrument at the serious music elite, with some success. Orchestral works featuring the Martenot’s serpentine tones began to appear, including Olivier Messiaen’s Turangalîla-symphonie (1948). Even so, Martenot performed a novelty turn during a demonstration in 1947 for the BBC in London, with impersonations of "a day-old chick, a nightingale, a mosquito, a blue-bottle, a gale-wind, a bomber and a machine gun," according to a newspaper report.', 'In Paris, another Frenchman, Georges Jenny (c.1900–76), was watching with interest. Sometime in the late ‘30s, he began to conceive of an instrument that applied some features of the Ondes Martenot, but it was less complex. He developed his concept while recovering from tuberculosis and put it into production as the Ondioline in the late ‘40s.', 'Jenny continued to refine and make Ondiolines for nearly 30 years, never licensing for mass production but instead offering completed instruments or self-assembly kits. At one point, he ran a small factory some 100 miles from Paris where he employed about 20 disabled people who used wheelchairs. Jenny had suffered from polio and sometimes used a wheelchair himself. A later estimate put total production at about 700, sold mainly in France and the USA.', 'The Ondioline pairs a small monophonic keyboard with a combo amp, rather like a Hammond Solovox. The keyboard features a lateral-movement, vibrato-producing mechanism similar to the Ondes Martenot. Running in front of the keyboard, a metal braid adds attack to a note if pressed at the same time as playing a note on the keyboard. Filter controls offer a range of sounds.', 'An Ondioline falls short of the expansive possibilities of Martenot’s instrument, but it is more versatile than the Solovox. In contrast with Maurice Martenot, there’s little sign that Georges Jenny ever promoted his instrument to classical musicians, instead aiming at the popular market. Footage from 1948 shows him demonstrating his invention’s aptitude for mimicry. In turn, a saxophonist, a violinist, and a banjo player start a tune that Jenny picks up, the Ondioline’s controls set to reproduce the appropriate timbre.', 'Around this time, Jean-Jacques Perrey (1929–2016) heard Jenny demonstrating the Ondioline on the radio. Perrey, a Parisian medical student who had previously studied music, was so impressed he called the radio station, obtained Jenny’s telephone number, and called Jenny himself.', 'Stating his interest in the Ondioline, but that he couldn’t afford one, Perrey made a proposal. Would Jenny lend him an instrument so that he, Perrey, could become proficient and then work for Jenny as a demonstrator? Jenny agreed and Perrey mastered the instrument in six months. Jenny was impressed, and Perrey abandoned medicine for the Ondioline. For the next 15 years or so, he travelled around Europe and eventually to the USA, peddling Ondiolines.', 'Perrey’s varied Ondioline discography includes four songs with the singer-songwriter Charles Trenet. One of these, "L’âme Des Poètes" (1951), was a big hit in France. There was also a live appearance with Edith Piaf, and an Ondioline demonstration disc. A series of albums on Vanguard in the ‘60s featured Ondioline and Moog and remain Perrey’s best-known recordings.', 'A few years before these, Perrey adopted the persona of Mr Ondioline, under which name he released two EPs of novelty pop. The cover of the first features "Mr Ondioline" sitting in front of his instruments, wearing a cape and hood, with slits for eyes. It’s an unintentionally disquieting image for a man who was, by all accounts, full of warmth and humor.', 'The Ondioline and the Ondes Martenot were in production for decades and developed over the years—the most notable change for both was a move from tube to solid-state technology in the ‘60s. Even so, they were always rare instruments. Perrey’s records aside, the Ondioline turned up in popular music infrequently. Alex North used one during his soundtrack for the movie Spartacus (1960), and in 1963 Kai Winding scored a US hit with "More," an instrumental with an Ondioline lead.', 'Al Kooper played Ondioline, notably on The Blues Project’s "No Time Like The Right Time," later included on the Nuggets compilation, and with Blood, Sweat & Tears. But as the ‘60s wore on, Ondiolines slipped into obscurity, though they remained in limited production until Jenny’s death in 1976. It seems he used poor quality components, which meant that Ondiolines often deteriorated into unplayability. Few survive today.', 'Two years after Jenny’s death, the New York new wave band Television released their second album, Adventure, featuring a six-minute song called "The Fire." Tom Verlaine, Television’s guitarist and singer, said in Elektra’s publicity literature that "the weird organ sound is an Ondioline. It’s a 36-note keyboard instrument that can quiver a note by shaking the key."', 'The Ondes Martenot remains a niche orchestral instrument to this day, though for decades it infrequently crossed over into popular forms. You can hear its demonstrative capacity on the original 1959 version of Jacques Brel’s emotionally tortured classic "Ne Me Quitte Pas." Léo Ferré, too, used it on a few of his ‘50s recordings. The Martenot found some traction among Canadian bands in the ‘70s, including Beau Dommage, Harmonium, and Et Cetera.', 'Maurice Jarre, father of Jean-Michel Jarre, used Martenot in film soundtracks, including Lawrence Of Arabia (1962). The British film and TV composer Barry Gray acquired one in the late ‘50s, traveling to Paris for tuition with Martenot himself. Gray sometimes used his Ondes Martenot in the music for Gerry Anderson’s Supermarionation puppet TV shows, such as the main theme for Fireball XL5.', 'Canadian bands aside, the Ondes Martenot was absent from rock music for years. Expensive, fragile, and complex, it just wasn’t the sort of thing you were going to put in the back of a tour bus. Then, gradually through the ‘90s, rock musicians became interested. Joe Jackson, Tom Waits, Bryan Ferry, and Damon Albarn have all made use of the instrument.', 'Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood first heard the Ondes Martenot "when a teacher at school played us Messiaen’s Turangalîla Symphony," he told Tom Service in 2005. "But I had no idea what it looked like, and then finally, when we were doing Kid A, I found one in Paris." This was a "student model," one of a limited run of 50 instruments built in 1983 by Martenot’s family after his death. It is digital, with four octaves rather than the usual six. Greenwood used it on Kid A, Amnesiac, and many subsequent Radiohead recordings, as well as on soundtracks including There Will Be Blood and We Need to Talk About Kevin.', 'What Maurice Martenot would have made of this we’ll never know. He died in a road traffic accident in Paris in 1980, four days before his 82nd birthday. Jonny Greenwood continues as the Ondes Martenot’s most vocal champion in what looks set to be a long second life for the instrument. In 2011, Greenwood obtained the first in a new line built by Jean-Loup Dierstein, which reverts to the original Ondes Musicales name. Five years later, he acquired an ASADEN Ondomo, a Japanese replica of an Ondes Martenot. "It’s not like other electronic instruments," he said.', 'About the author: Mark Brend is an author and a musician.

Many African ethnic groups were forcibly brought to Cuba during the transatlantic slave trade, and when they collided with Spanish culture under colonialism, cultural fusion ensued.', 'The four main African ethnic groups brought to Cuba were the Yoruba (from modern-day southwestern Nigeria and Benin), the Bantu (from the two Congos and Angola), the Calabar (from southeastern Nigeria and Cameroon), and the Dahomey (from modern-day Benin).', 'The Yoruba arrived relatively late in the slave trade and came in large numbers and concentrated waves during the nineteenth century. However, it was the Bantu who made up the largest number of enslaved people brought to Cuba, and who arrived throughout the colonial period. For this reason, these are the two African cultures that have had the largest influence on Cuban folkloric and popular music.', "Below, we're going to take a look at the origins of some of the most recognizable Afro-Cuban instruments.", 'The clave (which translates roughly to “key”) is the quintessential two-bar, syncopated rhythm that structures salsa and many other genres of Latin music. The instrument consists of a pair of claves, or hardwood sticks about eight inches long. One is held in the player’s fingertips over a cupped hand, and the other is struck against it to create a sharp, high-pitched rhythm.', 'Claves emerged during Cuba’s colonial period among slaves who worked in the shipyards of Havana and had the idea to use wooden pegs used in the repair or construction of ships as a musical instrument. They were recreating the west African notion of a timeline, a repeated rhythm that provides the structure and tempo for the rest of the musical ensemble.', 'It’s likely that the clave rhythm was first used to play rumba, the most important Afro-Cuban secular music and dance genre of the 19th century. Free and enslaved Black and mixed-race Cubans played rumba as their primary form of musical entertainment. Despite the fact that it sounds more African due to the dominance of the percussion and rhythmic elements, rumba is a hybrid genre that draws on European melodic patterns and Spanish language and poetic forms', 'Claves are used not only in rumba, but as the basis of many other Afro-Cuban styles, namely son (think: Buena Vista Social Club), considered to be the most important Cuban musical genre of the 20th century and a symbol of national identity.', 'Son is often described as the “perfect synthesis” of African and European musical traditions and, unlike rumba (whose instruments are all African-derived), son also incorporates European instruments, like the tres (Cuban guitar) and trumpet. Although claves are used in both traditions, the rumba and son clave rhythms are slightly distinct—the former is more syncopated.', 'One of the most popular and widely disseminated Afro-Cuban instruments is the conga drum, which is derived from various traditional Bantu drums—the name of the instrument references its Congolese ancestry.', 'Bantu music has been the most important African influence on Cuban popular music, including rumba and son. Conga drums are tall, single-headed hand drums that sit on the floor. Traditionally, they were made of hollowed-out tree trunks or wood and tuned with wooden pegs, although these days they’re often made from fiberglass.', 'While rumba’s early instrumentation was made up of cajones (see below), eventually three conga drums of different head diameters and registers came to be the center of the rumba ensemble—along with claves, a catá, and sometime a shékere (see below).', "Although not a part of early son in the 1920s and '30s, conga drums were eventually incorporated into son ensembles in the 1940s, by famed bandleader, composer and tres player Arsenio Rodríguez. From there, conga drums became an integral instrument in the salsa ensemble.", 'Cajons, or wooden boxes, were the first instrumentation used for playing rumba. In the late 19th century, many rumba musicians were dockworkers, and had access to cajones as they would unload cargo from incoming ships.', 'Musicians used cajons of different sizes to achieve lower or higher registers. Although conga drums replaced cajons within the rumba ensemble around the 1940s, in recent decades cajons have made a comeback. Many contemporary rumba groups in Cuba, like Yoruba Andabo and Clave y Guaguancó, use a combination of conga drums and cajones to achieve a wide variety of timbres.', 'Another Bantu-derived Cuban instrument that has gained popularity throughout the Latin music world is the bongó drums.Two short drums of different diameters are attached in the middle by a wooden bridge, and held between the player’s knees.', 'These drums were a feature of early son, and are now incorporated (along with conga drums) into some salsa ensembles.', 'In son, the drums play a cyclical rhythm called the martillo (“hammer). Bongó drums are also associated with the eastern Cuban folklore genre called changüí—a possible rural antecedent of son.', 'The shékere is an instrument found in various west African countries, including Nigeria and Ghana. It is made from a hollowed out gourd covered with beads or shells, which contribute to its unique timbre.', 'The player holds the handle in one hand and shakes the shékere, creating a rhythm by hitting it against the palm of the other hand. Shékeres are used primarily in Afro-Cuban religious genres—such as the Yoruba-derived Santería ceremony called güiro, which employ several shékeres—as well as in rumba.', 'The percussion instruments most intimately associated with the Afro-Cuban religion popularly known as Santeria are the Yoruba-derived batá drums. They are three double-headed, hourglass-shaped drums of different sizes: the iyá (largest or “mother” drum), the itótole (the medium-sized drum), and the okónkolo (smallest drum).', 'Six drumheads are struck in an overlapping manner, creating a rich and complex polyrhythmic texture. The drums are said to be having a conversation with each other, and speak directly to the supernatural forces known as orishas.', 'Batá drums which are used in religious ceremonies must be consecrated—a spiritual force called Añá is placed inside the drum—and drummers must also go through an initiation in order to play them.', 'In the past few decades, musicians have been incorporating unconsecrated batá drums into secular genres—Afrocuba de Matanzas even created a whole style that merged batá drumming with the rumba ensemble, called batarumba.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

She got the gig and headed for the frigid Twin Cities, embarking on a monumental four year period engineering records for her new boss: a 24-year-old autodidact virtuoso named Prince.', 'Rogers’ first tasks for Prince involved repairing his AMPEX MM-1200 tape machine and installing a new API console in his home studio as he underwent pre-production on Purple Rain. Soon after, she found herself thrown into the role of staff engineer as the Purple Rain recording sessions began to take shape. She oversaw his prodigal talent unfold in the studio in real time, often for 20 hours straight or more, working at light speed to record any and every instrument he could get his hands on.', 'The sounds of the 1980s began to shift and crystallize; synthesizers replaced guitars, rock and roll was no longer a dominating force, and drum sounds were manipulated and engorged. As indicated in most of his work through 1983-87, Prince was partial to the punchy sound of the Linn LM-1 drum machine, a flagship sampler of the decade.', 'As Rogers recalls, Prince had her apply a gated reverb preset called “Non Lin 2” from an AMS RMX16 digital reverb unit to the Linn LM-1, a unique production method that was highly favored and emulated at the time (“He loved that gated reverb,” she told Vox back in 2017). In fact, the AMS RMX16’s “Non Lin 2” can be heard all over Purple Rain, from the cracking snares on “When Doves Cry,” to the crashing drum sounds of the album’s resolute title track, and well beyond his 1984 triumph, notably on the pulsing kick drum of his hit single “Kiss.”', 'What made the effect such an interesting sound was its response to volume. Unlike natural reverb, which gradually diminishes in volume, gated reverb actually increases in volume upon impact. It combines a hollow effect with a punchy, back-end kick that was revolutionary in its time. It’s a sound so identifiably ‘80s, from a time when gated reverb reigned supreme, a feat owed greatly to the AMS RMX16.', 'Elsewhere in 1983, Kate Bush began constructing her own studio in a farmhouse on her family’s land in Welling, England—Bush was preparing to undergo production on her fifth studio album Hounds of Love. Amidst the 24-track recording consoles, her trusty Fairlight CMI, and a cluster of contemporary gear lining her Wickham Farm home studio, the AMS RMX16 found its way onto her studio racks, eventually earning a notable feature on the drum production of the album’s title track. Hounds of Love went on to top the UK album charts in 1985.', 'The inimitable AMS RMX16 and its signature “Non Lin 2” gated reverb sound would go on to shape the drum sounds of numerous chart-topping and timeless releases through the 1980s, like John Cougar Mellencamp’s “Jack & Diane,” and Van Halen’s “Jump,” but before the distillation of the effect into a compact and portable audio effects unit, gated reverb was just an abstract concept, and emulating its sound was like trying to catch lightning in a bottle.', 'It all started by accident in 1979. Engineer Hugh Padgham sat in the recording booth in London’s Townhouse Studio 2 listening to Phil Collins fiddle around behind his drums; they were both enlisted by Peter Gabriel to record a song that would become “Intruder,” the opening of his 1980 album Melt.', 'Studio 2 was equipped with several unique features. The isolation booth where Collins was recording was a stone-laden room with an impeccable live sound, and the production booth was outfitted with the SSL 4000 B mixing console—the first ever to be installed in a recording studio. The talkback microphone in the studio’s live room was wired into the SSL console with a heavy amount of compression so engineers and producers could adequately hear all of the musicians talking from the live room.', 'In a moment of waning focus, Padgham accidentally left the talkback microphone on while Collins was playing, yielding an intense, booming sound that came crashing through the studio monitors. The combination of the microphone’s heavy compression and the natural reverberation of the studio’s stone room had created a choked reverb sound.', 'Because the talkback mic was unable to be recorded on the SSL console, Padgham immediately rewired the board in order to record his intriguing discovery. Collins and Padgham would utilize the same process—now with an added noise gate—less than a year later while recording Collin’s international hit “In The Air Tonight” back in Townhouse’s Studio 2. The song’s groundbreaking success and popularity set the template of ‘80s drums production and spurred a generation of musicians to recreate the idiosyncratic sound of gated reverb.', 'Five years before the breakthrough of “In The Air Tonight,” former Aerospace engineer Mark Crabtree founded Audio Music Systems, known as AMS, with the intent of designing state of the art audio manipulation equipment. By 1981, AMS had already established success in their market when requests for a gated reverb began flooding his offices.', 'This launched Crabtree into designing an effect that emulated the Studio 2 drum sound to include in his newest system, the AMS RMX16, the world’s first microprocessor-controlled digital effects unit. The unit’s “Non Lin 2” preset is solely based on Padgham and Collins’ happy accident.', 'The AMS RMX16 debuted in 1982, with Prince and Kate Bush amongst the first to popularize and normalize its use in studio production. Peter Gabriel would recruit the “Non Lin 2” preset for his hit song “Sledgehammer.” Hall & Oates would follow with 1984’s “Dance On Your Knees,” as well as Dire Straits in 1985 with “Money For Nothing.” By the mid-1980s, nearly every major studio was equipped with an RMX16, as artists around the world were chasing the singular sound of the “Non Lin 2” gated reverb as heard on tracks from Bruce Springsteen, Duran Duran, Public Image Ltd, and countless more.', 'By 1990, popular music had changed, as it always does, and the charm of gated reverb had worn off. “We really kind of used it to death,” Rogers recalled to Vox. “By [Prince’s] Sign ‘O’ the Times, I was pretty sick of it.” And just like the double-neck guitar and bell bottom jeans before it, gated reverb had dissolved into the lexicon of episodic nostalgia, and left largely untampered for a number of decades.', 'Sometime in the mid-2010s, pop music had once again shifted, albeit back into an old familiar sound. Gated reverb was slowly making a comeback in drum production. In 2013, Pro Tools released an RMX16 plugin complete with the “Non Lin 2” preset. Pockets of buzzworthy musicians in New York and Los Angeles received critical acclaim on records with heavy amounts of gated reverb on the drums.', 'Artists like Dev Hynes and Carly Rae Jepsen embraced the archaic sounds of the 1980s, resurrecting the fad. Taylor Swift would follow suit. Earlier this year, AMS (now merged with Neve Electronics to form AMS Neve) announced the reissue of the RMX16 as a smaller 500 series model, which includes the original presets, and an additional 9 unique aftermarket programs. Now, the sound of the ‘80s is omnipresent once again nearly 40 years later.', 'No other sound has triumphed quite like RMX16’s “Non Lin 2.” Its meteoric rise through the 1980s is beholden to a studio mishap and the greatest drum fill of all time. Cutting edge tastemakers like Prince and Kate Bush used it to create some of their most long-standing and beloved bodies of work. It’s a sound that defined a generation of music, waded into obscurity, and was reborn decades later as something distinguished and imaginative. The everlasting AMS RMX16 will likely never die; we may get sick of it, but its likeness will permeate for ages.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

He looks down at an inexpensive, small display clamped to the headstock of his instrument, and in minutes he is in perfect tune with no need for a pickup, microphone, amplifier, or cables. This is common for countless musicians now, but it was unheard of before 1997.', 'Mark Wilson is a professional musician residing in the Dallas area. His career has lately been a bit crimped by the Covid virus, which has "really twisted everything around," he says. Being a pro musician is the very definition of "a living"—it\'s a career that can take all you\'ve got, and you could easily be "poor all the time." Mark is friendly, hard-working, opportunistic, visionary, and can be very tenacious about an idea.', 'Decades ago, Mark put these traits together to create the first clip-on tuner with the Intellitouch PT1. While companies like Boss and Korg had found success shrinking tuner technology down to handheld or pedalboard-friendly sizes, no one had thought to create a tuner that could detect vibrations directly from an instrument’s headstock. It would take Mark years of false starts and slow progress, before landing on a product that set the template for so many tuners available today.', 'Mark grew up in St. Louis and developed skill at playing bass guitar. At the age of 20, the union offered him a six-night-a-week country gig. Despite being completely unfamiliar with country music, he took it anyway, as it meant a steady paycheck. He worked that job for eight months, recalling it fondly as "a kick."', 'By age 27, he was still playing every night, but had moved to supper clubs through five steadily working bands. One day, when he was replaced in a band by a formally trained musician, Mark realized he needed to get educated in music if he wanted long-term success. So, in 1980, he moved to Denton, Texas, to start a jazz education curriculum, and began working in the local Dallas music scene.', 'About the time he graduated in 1983, he met an alto sax player named Spud Curtis. They would wind up playing Dixieland music together in Dallas for years—and becoming business partners.', 'Spud was very outgoing. A jazz player, he would walk into a dark heavy rock club, unpack his sax, and jump up onstage to join the surprised rock band. Spud also had a big effect on Mark, and had a saying that Mark adopted: "I\'m just going at it like I knew what I was doing."', "In 1984, Spud had become a partner in a computer equipment company. This was a high-growth business in the early '80s, and Dallas was a tech hotbed. Mark started hanging with Spud and his partner Phil Matthews at their office. Here, he first observed the entrepreneurial mindset in action.", "With hardly more than a business card, a letterhead, and a lot of time on the phone, Phil and Spud were making money with their ideas. Mark was intrigued by these methods and began himself to entertain larger ideas, as his musician's paycheck was sometimes a bit modest. The entrepreneurial bug had bit him.", 'By 1985, the Schecter Guitar Research had relocated to Dallas (after a group of Texas investors purchased the brand), and Mark had made an appointment there to order a new bass. The sales manager casually expressed the need for Schecter to offer an in-house active pickup. Seeing an opportunity, Mark formed a plan to establish a company to provide these pickups. Not being technical, he planned to contract out the detailed design and manufacturing.', 'He contacted Schecter\'s then-owner, Clark Schwartz, directly, and proposed this. But Clark turned out to have a more urgent need: an inexpensive tuner that could be built into a guitar. Mark was fine with working on a tuner: "A tuner was just as easy to do as a pickup, because I didn\'t know anything about either of them!" He told Clark he would get back to him.', 'Mark needed an engineering perspective, so he contacted North Texas University (now UNT), where he had gone to school. He was referred to Dr. Russ Pinizzotto, a specialist in materials characterization and musical acoustics. Mark told him he needed his help to make a million dollars; Russ laughed and said to come on by. The two agreed that Schecter should be able to pay for the product development—they noted that Clark drove a Porsche, after all. At one point, Russ remarked that they could use a suction cup on the guitar and "suck" the music right out of it.', 'This particular partnership failed to assemble the talent to complete a design, and the deal with Schecter fell through, but Mark was now fixed on the idea of a vibration-based tuner. Such a tuner would be immune to room noise and would not require a cable, so any instrument could use it. It should have an edge over the traditional, non-contact, "mic and plug" handheld tuners from Korg, Seiko, and Roland.', 'As John Lennon sang, "Life is what happens to you while you\'re busy making other plans." Mark carried on through the next couple of years, working on identifying and developing major computer-related projects for Spud and Phil\'s company. Through it all, he was thinking about the tuner idea—and that it might have the potential for the kind of work he would really want to be doing.', 'He eventually met an electrical engineer by the name of Earl Born through another entrepreneurial venture. (Mark had convinced Phil to form a partnership to lease a Cessna aircraft to a local flight school. In return, they got free flying lessons and gained their licenses. They eventually decided to sell the plane, and Earl turned up as an interested buyer.)', 'Mark was always on the lookout for electrical engineers, so he filled Earl in on his tuner idea. Earl had a plan to build a printed circuit board shop in Mexico as a maquiladora, and he proposed designing the tuner if Mark would agree to let him manufacture it. Today, Mark describes Earl as "a little wise old elf," a real capable "backroom" kind of guy. Earl immediately asked Mark to borrow a guitar.', 'Earl found that the headstock was the best place to sample the vibrations. There were two reasons: First, the strings terminate there, so there is good mechanical coupling, and second, the small, rigid mass of the headstock does not resonate with room noise like the guitar body does.', 'Physics aside, Mark thought a tuner on the headstock was an aesthetically terrible idea, and he immediately began to think about how it could be made to look cooler.', 'Other key accomplishments came out of this period. Mark wrote up a detailed user\'s manual at Earl\'s behest ("So your engineers know when your product is working"). Mark also made a sketch of the tuning indicators, using three arrows on each side. Earl used the manual and sketch to create an elegant LCD segmented display. Mark, full of optimism, had 5,000 of the displays built at a local shop, gave Earl three of them, and stored the rest in his front hall closet.', 'Earl then built an electrical design around the display. With Earl\'s mechanical engineer friend Vic Moreland, they built three prototypes by hand. Although bulky and not productized at all, as Mark says, "they kinda sorta worked." The tuner idea was now real.', "In early 1990, Mark rented a booth at the NAMM show, where he demonstrated the prototypes, earned an endorsement from bassist and composer Michael Manring, and gained orders for 75 tuners. With all that, he finally had some tangible results, and figured he could leverage that into the rest of what he needed. And while he knew that the prototypes still needed major development to be ready for the market, he didn't know he was still years away from being able to deliver them.", "Mark realized he was going to need capital to purchase the tuners from Earl, operate a shop, and hire employees. As luck would have it, Mark met Lynn Howard, a software programmer creating business planning software. They became friends, and Mark became an eager beta tester of Lynn's program, using it to experiment with hundreds of financial models. He learned the effects of different assumptions in the financial statements that the program produced. Settling on the best one, he started to assemble a business plan to show to potential investors.", "More time passed, and in 1991 Mark moved to Dallas proper. His new landlord, Bob Snyder, turned out to be a talented software engineer. Mark and Bob instantly became friends, being like-minded, single, and entrepreneurial. One day, Mark mentioned to Bob that he had an order for 75 tuners, which was a problem because the design wasn't anywhere ready to ship. Bob was intrigued and eventually said he could improve the code. Mark was hesitant to risk ruining the friendship—a good friendship is worth a lot, after all.", "The user's guide and display came in handy to give Bob a good idea of what was required of the software. Bob looked around at the available microcontroller chips and settled on a Motorola 8-bit model.", 'Nowadays, pitch detection might commonly be done by digitizing the signal with an analog-to-digital converter, then doing the math—perhaps a Fourier transform—in a digital signal processor or DSP chip. But back then, these were prohibitively expensive. The only way to meet the cost target was to use an inexpensive serial microcontroller ("micro") and hopefully not much else.', 'Mark invested in development tools, and Bob developed the code, eventually writing six different versions for testing. Bob\'s design started with a piezoelectric crystal to detect the instrument vibrations, and the signal was amplified through two op-amp gain stages until it was a square wave, then sent to a general input pin on the micro. The micro then timed the intervals between zero crossings and kept track of how many of each length occurred, creating frequency "bins."', 'The pitch-detection algorithm, informally called a "ring toss," worked on the principle that the fundamental frequency will have the most common occurrence rate, the peg with the most rings. The signal is also transiently chaotic, as the guitar vibrates at the fundamental but also has the first and second, and all the other harmonics all ringing and changing—a moving target. The algorithm worked well despite its simplicity. Overall, Bob put 500 hours into the software, eventually creating six different versions for testing.', 'Mark invited musicians over to his apartment to try the versions out. The setup on the dining room table included a PC and lots of loose wires connecting a shoebox-sized emulator, with the LCD display connectors held together with rubber bands. Eventually, everyone agreed on the best version and the software was ready at last.', 'The micro had extra pins, so Bob used them to drive the LCD display segments directly, avoiding an extra LCD controller chip. The display had seven segments for the musical note, six for the arrows, and various other indicators for a total of 17 segments. Other than an op-amp, a battery, and some buttons, there was very little else to the electrical design. Mark now needed an electrical engineer to turn everything on the table into a battery-powered circuit inside a small plastic housing.', 'At the time, Mark didn\'t have an obvious source for the circuit board, plastics, and retail packaging. But he kept the faith. "There was a lot of down time in between waiting for the right people to show up. I had to keep the pilot light lit the whole time, while working on the next obstacle," he says.', 'Looking back, he said he was fortunate in that most every task he encountered required him to stretch, learn about new things, and develop new skills. For example, "At the start, I knew nothing about printed circuit boards, but I now understand the entire process. Don\'t let lack of knowledge be a deterrent—it is really an exciting preview of the things you will soon be learning!"', 'By "hanging out and listening," he followed his friend Spud\'s advice: "Pay attention and learn, and pretty soon you do know what you\'re doing."', 'During this time, Mark began approaching potential investors with his business plan. He spoke with Stanley Marcus of Neiman Marcus, John Justin of Justin Boots, and singer Charley Pride, each of whom expressed only passing interest.', "In December of 1995, with the displays still sitting in the front closet, Mark was playing a gig, as usual, this time at Merrill Lynch's Entrepreneur of the Year award event. During the evening, he watched Jerry Rogers, founder of Cyrix Corporation, a manufacturer of PC microprocessors, receive the award. Jerry was a visionary chip designer who had gone head-to-head against Intel and AMD in the microprocessor market. Intel had sued him nine times and lost each time. He had been on the cover of Forbes and seemed like a smart, approachable guy. Mark decided that he needed to give Jerry a call.", "Jerry called him back, they set an appointment to meet at Cyrix' offices, and Mark showed him the prototypes and the business plan. Jerry was receptive to the tuner idea at once, and one year later he agreed to fund the rest of the development. With Jerry on board, a company was formed: OnBoard Research Corporation.", "A Cyrix engineer was drafted to design the PCB, while Jerry brought in Clarence Zierhut to design the plastics. Clarence, who had designed handheld weapon props for the Star Wars movies, designed the tuner's plastics and the clamp according to Mark's concept, while deferring payment to help with cash flow on the project.", 'An operations expert, Rusty Membreno, joined the team to source parts, pay the bills, and get finished units out the door. Mark says, "Rusty always surprised me with how much he could get done in a day. He was like a machine." Rusty was key in driving the unit cost down from $25 originally to less than $5. With a $60,000 plastics mold and the production circuit board, the world\'s first clip-on vibration tuner was a true physical reality, and a marketable product.', "In 1997, roughly 10 years after Mark's first discussion of tuners with Schecter, OnBoard had tuners ready to ship. Mark promptly went on the road to evangelize the product, dubbed the Intellitouch tuner, at trade shows and music festivals.", 'The company lost $250k in each of the first two years but made it all back at the end of four, when the product took off and sold well. In all, 2 million tuners were ultimately sold, an unqualified success. A particularly rich market was the bluegrass scene; at their festivals, players used to spend a lot of time just getting in tune. Mark was told, "You used to be able to tell the good players, who were in tune, from the bad ones, who weren\'t—not anymore!"', "The company had about four years with basically no competition as the big music suppliers were watching and waiting to see if this tiny company's new product category would take off. And while OnBoard had a good run, the competition did finally come on strong.", "At a certain point, there was disagreement on the purpose, future direction, and investment of the company, and Mark wasn't able to realize the new tuners he envisioned to keep the company's edge. So, reluctantly, he resigned and offered his stock for sale to the other partners. It was time to relax a little.", 'I asked Mark for some words of wisdom from his journey. He brought up the concept of the "master idea," a life-changing and therefore deeply compelling and long-lasting idea. It starts with "Wouldn\'t it be great if..." The idea comes with its corresponding question: How do I get this done? This big question answers itself if you ask enough little questions; you keep asking the next smaller question until you start to find answers. It\'s like your master idea has dropped breadcrumbs from the future and your task is to find them, and when enough are found, your master idea will simply fall in place. You must keep at it: Great questions take time to answer, and it is okay to let things float and stay unanswered for a while. But wherever you are and whatever your idea, there are breadcrumbs at your feet to find.', 'Mark has since been playing music nonstop—bass, mandolin, guitar and pedal steel. The tuner venture was worth it, and not just financially—Mark says he had the time of his life, and that his role was as if meant for him, a "big picture" guy, but augmented by a technical team to manage the many details.', 'In his past role, Mark attended many bluegrass gatherings telling the Intellitouch story. Someone there gifted him a mandolin, and he spent time learning to play it, eventually adding it to his other instruments. And he tunes it with an Intellitouch tuner.', 'About the author: George Biner is an electrical engineer, musician, and recordist who resides in Los Angeles.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Even if the studio is full of seasoned professionals, accidents are going to happen during a session.", 'Most mistakes in the studio are caught and corrected, but in some cases the effect of those mistakes was so perfect that they were left in the song. Some were even later recreated in countless other recordings and defined decades of popular music.', "In this article, we'll highlight some well-known and more obscure studio mistakes that not only made it onto the record, but elevated the recordings and influenced other artists.", 'What we won\'t include in this article are examples where it\'s unsure if something was actually a mistake, such as the meter change in Blondie\'s "Heart of Glass," Grimes\' out-of-sync bass in "Oblivion," or the artistic choice to let vocals clip by Neutral Milk Hotel.', 'We also won\'t include certain noises caught in the back of tracks, such as talking before the track (e.g., "Sweet Home Alabama"), bad splicing (e.g., "Paper Planes" by MIA), or coughing (e.g., "Wish You Were Here).', 'It may not have been a hit single, but Prince\'s "Forever In My Life" is a favorite among his fans and widely considered to be one of his most personal songs. And it contains a pretty major error for an artist who often gets labeled as a perfectionist.', 'Prince was notorious for recording every part for many of his songs in his home studio with just a recording engineer by his side. When he was recording "Forever In My Life," he was joined in the studio by engineer Susan Rogers. In a rush, she accidentally synced the background vocals so they came before the main vocal lines they were supposed to mirror.', 'The result is a background vocal performance that drives the song forward. And though Rogers offered to fix the issue for Prince, he loved it and decided to release it.', '"Creep" might be the most well-known Radiohead song and their breakout hit, but certain members of the band didn\'t want the song on the record at all. Namely guitarist Jonny Greenwood, who didn\'t like how quiet the song was. During a take, in a quiet moment of the song moving from the verse to the chorus, he "hit the guitar hard—really hard" to try to spoil the recording.', 'In the end, Greenwood\'s attempt to ruin the take and the song added an intense energy to the song and stands out as one of the best moments on "Creep."', "Gated Reverb might be the sound of the '80s, but how did it come about? Completely by accident.", 'During the recording of Peter Gabriel\'s third solo album in 1979, a room mic picked up the sound of Phil Collins\' drum during the recording of "Intruder." Engineer Hugh Padgham had placed a heavily compressed talk-back mic in the room, and that in combination with the console\'s noise gate gave birth to what we now know as gated reverb.', 'Since the genesis (see what we did there?) of this mistake, gated reverb has been used by artists from Prince to Kate Bush to Lorde.', "When you think about fuzz, you probably don't think about country music. But you should.", 'While recording the six-string bass solo for Marty Robbins\' "Don\'t Worry" in 1960, popular session guitarist Grady Martin found himself recording through a faulty channel in the mixing desk—one of the tube preamps was failing and resulted in a heavily distorted bass tone. Understandably, Martin was upset to find his take ruined.', "But producer Don Law didn't see the take as ruined. He liked the novel effect and left the take in the final version of the song, and history was made. The song was a crossover hit at the time—Robbins' seventh number one hit on the country chart and peaking at number three on the pop chart.", "Session engineer Glen Snoddy didn't fix the faulty channel and instead made it available to other musicians, who loved the sound. There was such a demand for it, in fact, that Snoddy reverse-engineered the faulty channel into the Fuzz-Tone—a circuit that could replicate the distorted sound—which was eventually given to Gibson who manufactured the FZ-1 Fuzz-Tone under their Maestro subsidiary.", 'It\'s not uncommon for bands to adjust their instrumentation around the lyrics. Think the six triplets during the line "robbing people with a six gun" in "I Fought The Law" mimicking the unloading of a six-shooter.', 'But The Cars weren\'t thinking about using the drums to illustrate the lyrics when drummer David Robinson accidentally started hitting his snare on the one and three rather than the two and four that he had been emphasizing right before the line "I kinda lose my mind" in the second verse.', 'The result completely disrupts the meter for a few lines before landing back in sync, and the mistake fit so perfectly with the line "I kinda lose my mind" that the band decided to keep it. The adopted mistake also repeats right before that next chorus.', '"Louie, Louie" as performed by The Kingsmen rose to infamy upon release. Not just because it\'s catchy, but because the lyrics are almost completely unintelligible, which led to a 31-month investigation into the lyrics, which many thought must have been profane.', "So, why can't we understand a word singer Jack Ely was singing? Was he drunk or high?", 'Nothing so nefarious was the cause, as it turns out. Jack Ely was only 19 years old when he recorded "Louie, Louie," which was captured in a single take by Portland, Oregon DJ Ken Chase. The unique vocal performance is due to a combination of two things: His mouth was cut up from his braces, and he was singing into an unnaturally high boom mic—craning his neck and singing directly into the air. There\'s a reason you\'re not taught that technique during vocal lessons.', 'The strained neck and no small amount of mouth pain turned the lyrics into a garbled mess. And while one might imagine such a mistake would hurt record sales, the mystery of the lyrics was a PR boom for the band—even if it did mean they were investigated by the FBI.', 'But that\'s not the only mistake from the "Louie, Louie" recording session. Just after the lead guitar break, Ely overshot his mark and came in too early, which drummer Lynn Easton quickly covered for with a drum fill. This error became so popular that it was duplicated by other groups that have since covered the Richard Berry-penned classic.', 'The Breeders had a crossover hit with their 1993 song "Cannonball." The intro to "Cannonball" is iconic in its own right, starting with distorted harmonies from the Deal twins, a clicking snare rim and cymbal stand and, finally, bassist Josephine Wiggs\' sliding bass riff.', 'But wait, why is she sliding to the A in the intro, but the Bb everywhere else?', 'During rehearsals for the song, Wiggs struggled initially to slide to the Bb, instead landing on the A time after time. So, Wiggs would stop, and then try to find the right note. Ultimately, the band decided to leave the slide up to the A in the intro, which adds suspense to the powerful track.', "The title track from Master of Puppets was an enormous hit for Metallica when it was released in 1986, and it features one of Kirk Hammett's most iconic solos. It also features a mistake that was so perfect that Hammett has been trying to recreate it for decades, to varying degrees of success.", "During his final solo, Hammett's finger slips off the neck, pulling the top string off with it. It created a high-pitched squeal. While it might not have been what he intended, the result was beloved by fans and the band alike. It was even ranked #51 in Guitar World's 100 Greatest Guitar Solos.", '"Tin roof, rusted!" It\'s a mysterious line that\'s led to plenty of conjecture about its meaning, but it wasn\'t originally supposed to be part of the B-52s biggest hit, "Love Shack."', 'While recording "Love Shack," The B-52s took a live jam approach, especially at the end of the track. The band was freestyling and all dropped out at the same time, but singer Cindy Wilson hadn\'t realized when she came in with the ad libbed tin roof line.', 'As you can hear from the laughter immediately following the sheepish, "rusted," the band loved the moment and they kept it in. It ended up in the radio edit, becoming one of the most quoted lines from the song.', 'Forgotten and incorrect lyrics make their way onto released songs with some regularity, but there are a few cases where some of the most famous singers in popular music took the opportunity to create something more memorable than the original lyrics.', 'Bill Withers famously forgot the lyrics to 1971\'s "Ain\'t No Sunshine" during his recording session. Instead of stopping the tape, he tried to buy himself some time. How\'d he do that? By repeating the lyric, "I know, I know, I know…" until he found his place again. Part of what makes this work is his delivery; he sounds like he\'s accepting an increasingly difficult fact.', 'Eleven years earlier, Ella Fitzgerald said to a crowd of her fans, "We hope we remember all the words," as the band started playing "Mack the Knife" from her Ella in Berlin live record. As you probably guessed, she did not remember all the words. But for what she didn\'t remember, she ad-libbed some charming lines and later took home two Grammy awards during the 3rd Annual Grammy Awards for her troubles.', 'Among this excellent company is also Fontella Bass, who forgot some of her own lyrics in 1965 while in the studio recording "Rescue Me." And like Withers, she too kept the session going. "Back then, you didn\'t stop while the tape was running," Bass said later. "I remembered from the church what to do if you forget the words. I sang, \'Ummm, ummm, ummm,\' and it worked out just fine."', "When you're recording music, it's understandable to want your performance and each take to be flawless. But a lot of studio magic is found in experimentation, mistakes, and being open-minded about what actually suits a song.", 'And, sometimes, a mistake or an accident can even influence others to replicate that sound, like the examples with Phil Collins, Marty Robbins, and Kirk Hammett. Other times, they make a song more fun and memorable, like The B-52s and Radiohead.', "Start your recording experiments today, and don't sweat the mistakes.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Ever since the ‘60s, the UK punched way above its weight in commercial rock and pop music, but it had less impact on instruments played by legendary artists. One area where Britain led the way, however, is amplification, where Marshall’s stacks were the launch pad for The Who, Jimi Hendrix, and, subsequently, the sound of heavy rock and metal.', 'James Charles Marshall (better-known as Jim) started out as a tool-making engineer, a tap dancer turned professional singer and serious big-band drummer, and an inspirational drum teacher whose pupils included Hendrix’s Mitch Mitchell, as well as Micky Waller (Jeff Beck, Rod Stewart), Mick Underwood (The Herd, Gillan), and John Marshall (Soft Machine).', 'Jim Marshall’s elevation to number one Father of Loud was almost accidental, born from a sideline at his music shop. The Marshall store, on Uxbridge Road in Hanwell, north-west London, was frequented by stars such as Pete Townshend and also the leading session guitarists of the day, including Big Jim Sullivan, Jimmy Page, and Ritchie Blackmore.', 'Throughout his long and celebrated career, Jim never lost his love for drums. As a young man, he took lessons with the formidable Max Abrams and, like Max, he played Premier drums—the UK’s outstanding brand. His shop secured a prestigious Premier dealership back in the early days.', 'Premier enjoyed many decades of success, but by the time of the 2008 economic crash, the harsh realities of competition from Chinese factories and from global trade in general were taking a grievous toll. A plethora of individual British craft drum builders tried their hands at filling the gap, sparking a renaissance in drum building. Names like Noonan, HighWood, Jalapeno, KD, Guru, and others garnered outstanding reviews.', 'Meanwhile, the now aging Jim Marshall was determined to own a drum brand with a British heritage. Premier seemed the obvious choice, but this was not to be. Instead, in 2010, Marshall announced the acquisition of Natal.', 'Like Marshall, Natal came to international attention in the mid \'60s. "Natal" suggests South Africa, but in fact it was the British percussionist Alan Sharp who came up with the name, an elision of "Natalie" (Sharp’s wife) and "Alan." Sharp, who died in 2013, was a studious Afro-Cuban percussionist and a one-time member of the hit British funk-Latin-disco band Gonzalez.', 'Sharp’s story is of the dedicated musician frustrated at being unable to get the gear he wants and who therefore sets about making it himself. This was way back in 1958. He sourced individual parts and assembled his own-design Afro-Cuban congas in his North London apartment.', 'He pioneered the use of fiberglass for his conga shells and guiros, which he actually molded at home. Amazingly, he also cast his own aluminum "crowns," a style of hoop since dubbed the "comfort hoop," because it’s kinder to the conguero’s hands than the traditional sharp-edged steel rim.', 'Fellow percussionists came calling, the brand slowly took off, and the Natal Percussion Company was launched in 1965. Like Marshall, Natal arrived at the right moment to fulfill a need in the British market. Natal congas had striking "dribble" finishes in black, red, and yellow, and their fiberglass shells meant they were considered louder than congas made with traditional stave wood. Natal could be seen on stage with Led Zeppelin, Bob Marley’s Wailers, Deep Purple, The Rolling Stones, T.Rex, Fleetwood Mac—pretty much everybody, really.', 'Alan Sharp continued to develop Natal until the ‘80s, when he moved to Cuba to study. The company was left with his student, Steve Mutter, a talented woodworker. Mutter introduced the first Natal congas made with ash-wood staves before selling to Craig Fenney of the Music Shipping Company in the late ‘90s. Fenney successfully expanded the percussion range during the early 2000s, until Jim Marshall came knocking.', 'Marshall’s sales director Craig Glover tells me that Jim liked the fact there were no rules with Natal, no legacy of products. "It was a blank canvas," he says. "You could start from the ground up. So all the designs were done in the UK, and all the tooling was owned by Marshall. Jim did not want generic drum products—he wanted everything unique. All along, the brief was to create an absolutely fantastic product."', 'It was important at first for Marshall to have something UK-built, so the first product was a snare drum with an ash-stave shell, built in the Marshall factory in Milton Keynes, north-west of London. The use of ash was a direct leap from the ash-stave congas. There was also a set of snare drums with hammered-steel shells offered in various finishes.', 'When it came to full kits, however, the Marshall factory was not set up to produce drums in volume, and so drum sets and drum hardware were manufactured in two facilities in Taichung, Taiwan. Glover says it would have been far cheaper to produce the tooling and hardware and kits in China.', '"But in Taiwan, everything follows the same quality-control processes that Marshall uses for its amplifiers. As a huge manufacturing company, Marshall could go in and say this is how we are going to set up the factory, putting all the processes in place to make the exact products that we wanted."', 'The Natal drum brand was unleashed at the 2010 Musikmesse in Frankfurt, alongside Natal’s existing congas and other percussion instruments. As if from nowhere, a new drum set appeared with a strong, fully realized visual identity. This had much to do with the lug design, which incorporated the original Natal sun logo in a thickly-cast circular zinc body. The motif was repeated on the twin badges affixed to each drum, with air-vent holes neatly providing the "sun" of the Natal logo.', 'Further examination revealed abundant evidence of thoughtful design. The Tri-Throw snare strainer, the trickiest mechanical puzzle for any aspiring new drum company, also had the circular lug shape and sun motif, for example, but it offered three tension positions rather than simply an on-off.', 'For the inevitable small-tom resonance mount, Natal’s design team favored the ball-and-socket style, but they were unhappy with the way resin balls eventually wear and develop a positional "memory." The solution was to use a non-slip aluminum ball instead. Attention to quality control extended to the chroming on the lugs, too, which were polished by hand rather than machine. "There’s obviously an extra cost to that," Glover says, "but it has that really deep shine."', 'Right down to the minutiae, Natal seemed determined to go the extra distance. The Tru-Tune tension rods had tips dipped in red nylon to reduce detuning, and they incorporated no fewer than three washers: small and large steel, plus black nylon. Glover offers one more example: "We use British beeswax on the bearing edges. Jim insisted on using that, because it’s the best thing for the job. They couldn’t get it in Taiwan, so we flew over with a block of it," he adds with a smile.', 'With the hardware so well thought out, Marshall decided to make it universal to all the new drums. Glover says the first kits all had the same hardware, the same components—they just changed the wood. "So if you had ash, it would be cheaper than birch, and slightly cheaper than maple. The wood dictates the price. After we launched, we did that for five years, so there were no lower-level products."', 'These so-called Originals kits were all offered at competitive prices, belying their top professional quality. And at the same time, Natal delivered two complete sets of entirely UK-designed stands and pedals, bristling with cool ideas, as feature-packed as the drums.', 'Once the Originals series was firmly established, Natal added Arcadia in 2015 and Café Racer in 2017. Café Racer is now probably Natal’s best seller, using tulipwood (also known as yellow poplar) and offering new finishes. Glover says little was changed beyond the wood and the finishes. "It’s still made in Taiwan, hits a sweet price point, and has a superb vintage sound," he claims.', 'Arcadia, too, retains the Natal characteristics, but it’s made in China. Glover again: "Eventually we did produce a kit in China, because we needed something at a different price point. But it follows the same quality control procedure." The seamless acrylic-shelled version of the Arcadia is particularly impressive and marks another success for Natal.', 'The story of Natal drums is heartening. Jim Marshall lived to see his dream project realized: a top-notch Marshall-owned and Marshall-inspired British drum division.', 'Jim died in 2012, the 50th anniversary year of his legendary company, and as a tribute, Natal produced 50 glorious kits finished in Marshall’s signature black cabinet vinyl fitted with gold-plated hardware.', 'A testament to Natal’s popularity today is the growing list of varied endorsers, such as Sean Moore (Manic Street Preachers), Pat Lundy (Modestep), and Oli Wiseman (Anne-Marie). Craig Glover thinks it unlikely that a company the size of Marshall will ever again invest in a drum brand the way it has. "You need a lot of passion and desire," he says. "It was always to do with Jim Marshall’s passion as a drummer."', 'About the author: Geoff Nicholls is a musician, author, journalist, and lecturer based in London.

That’s the rather bold claim that Dubreq made about its curious pocket synth, aka the Stylophone, back when its now-disgraced chief exponent was regarded as a national treasure.', 'Aussie cartoonist/musician Rolf Harris had already put a far more primitive instrument on the map, the novelty form of percussion known as the wobble board, when he introduced the Stylophone to an unsuspecting public in the late 1960s. In fact, there was only one such thing in existence when his eponymous BBC light entertainment vehicle beat The David Frost Show to the punch to nab its first TV appearance. But within a few years, more than three million people had succumbed to its unusual charms.', 'This figure just happened to include a then-unknown bona fide legend in the process of reinventing himself for the first (but certainly not the last) time. Yes, although the Stylophone was heavily marketed toward kids—inventor Brian Jarvis only stumbled upon the idea while fixing his niece’s toy piano, after all—it also attracted the attention of three men who would shape the musical landscape of the early 1970s and beyond.', 'The buzzing sound you can hear during the verses of David Bowie’s breakthrough hit "Space Oddity"? That’s the Stylophone given to the Thin White Duke by close friend Marc Bolan, who in turn was introduced to the instrument by their shared producer Tony Visconti. Unsurprisingly, makers Dubreq quickly capitalized on this unlikely boost in credibility, using Bowie’s image in a number of press ads declaring that "the craze has begun."', 'Bowie would later return to the Stylophone on 2002’s Heathen ("Slip Away"), telling British chat show host Jonathan Ross that same year, "It’s the only instrument I take on holiday with me to compose on." But how exactly does it work?', 'Well, the original 1967 model used a printed circuit board to form a metal keyboard, with each note—played by using the pen-like stylus—connected via a different-value resistor to a voltage-controlled oscillator.', 'Additional features were pretty thin on the ground. Users could attempt to control the vibrato of the distinctive buzz that occurred whenever a circuit closed, although any differences were barely audible. Oh, and there was a power switch, too. But if you wanted the luxury of bass, classic and treble sounds you essentially had to buy three different models.', 'Stylophonists had to wait until the mid-1970s to get their hands on something a little more advanced. Dwarfing the standard model at more than six times the size and needing twice as much battery power, the 350S might not have offered as much portability. However, it could boast a range of 44 notes and 3.5 octaves (compared to the original’s 20/1.5), a larger speaker which allowed users to pump up the volume and an additional array of features ranging from reiteration to decay. There was even an extra stylus and a photo option which enabled sound to be controlled by ambient light.', 'Sadly, the 350S initially proved to be the Stylophone’s swansong as shortly after its release, Dubreq ceased all production. Nonetheless, this discontinuation only added to its cult appeal and over the next three decades a whole host of artists much cooler than Rolf Harris kept the instrument alive.', '', 'Perhaps unsurprisingly, electronic music pioneers Kraftwerk were one of the first notable names to utilize its limited but intriguing sound. Whereas "Space Oddity" had kept the droning noise in the background, the quartet’s 1981 single "Pocket Calculator" planted it center stage—you can even see Karl Bartos armed with a stylus in its live performance video. Heavily inspired by the Germans, siblings Paul and Phil Hartnoll, aka techno legends Orbital, would later score a Top 20 hit at the turn of the century with the similarly Stylophone-heavy "Style."', 'The Stylophone would also become a firm favorite with those U.K. guitar bands who were a little too idiosyncratic to fit into the straight-forward Britpop scene. Pulp paid perhaps the most obvious homage to the mini-synth on their 1992 B-side "Styloroc (Nites of Suburbia)," and four years on Scottish indie heroes Belle and Sebastian also joined in with all the stylus fun on If You’re Feeling Sinister’s "Mayfly."', 'Manic Street Preachers—longtime fans of possibly the first pop act to embrace the instrument, The Small Faces (1968 B-side "Donkey Rides, A Penny, A Glass")—even recorded a Stylophone solo for their 2001 comeback single "So Why So Sad."', 'But it took until 2007 for the Stylophone to experience a true renaissance, and touchingly, it was one spearheaded by its creator’s son. A full 40 years after his soundtrack dubber father first threw dismantled piano keys, circuit boards and metal pens into one slightly discordant mix, Ben Jarvis joined forces with toy manufacturer Re:creation for an unlikely product revival.', 'The S-1 Stylophone might not have pleased the purists who didn’t appreciate its substitution of the original’s oscillator for a 555 chip. But it still proved popular enough to launch several further variations including the S2, Gen X-1 and the Beatbox, the latter a circular-shaped percussive take on the instrument which enabled users to create their own rhythms and bass loops.', 'And then in 2019, the Dubreq company released the GEN R-8, a significantly larger limited edition Stylophone whose three-octave touch keyboard (no styluses necessary here), 16-step sequencer and MIDI support truly brought the instrument into the modern age.', 'By this point, a whole new generation had discovered the joys of the Stylophone. YouTuber Brett Domino racked up nearly two million views with a medley of hip-hop classics performed on the mini-keyboard. Having already used a Stylophone on The White Stripes’ "Icky Thump," Jack White then launched a custom-made line for one of his other countless projects, The Raconteurs. And in 2017 it appeared on the big screen during Ansel Elgort’s music-making montage in car chase thriller Baby Driver.', 'This brush with Hollywood is just the latest sign that, despite its toy origins and early alignment with kids entertainers, the unexpectedly enduring Stylophone can no longer be dismissed as mere child’s play.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Sometimes, despite the manufacturer’s best intentions, a synth just doesn’t click with the buying public.', 'There are any number of reasons for this. Synthesis styles can change seemingly overnight. R&D is a long process, and an instrument designed to take over the world may find that the world has moved on in the meantime. Other instruments may sound great but are too niche to really catch fire. Or, the company is forced to go out of business, dooming an otherwise great product to die a premature death.', 'Let’s take a look at synthesizers from the shoulda woulda coulda file—instruments that, under different circumstances, could have become the classics they were intended to be. Synths that—like the proverbial fish—got away.', 'In 1998, everyone wanted analog modeling or PCM sound synthesis. There were a few oddballs in there as well, like physical modeling, but most hardware offered either digital recreations of analog synthesis, or ultra-realism in the form of samples. FM was decidedly old hat.', 'And yet into this market, Yamaha released the FS1R. The silver 1U rackmount instrument had an advanced form of FM synthesis with eight operators and a number of different waveforms, including Sine, All1, All2, Odd1, Odd2, Res1, Res2, and Formant. Yes, formant.', 'Along with FM, the FS1R could also do formant synthesis and was capable of the usual vowel sounds associated with it but also physical modeling. It sounds absolutely incredible, and the onboard effects only add to the beauty of the sounds it can produce.', 'Unfortunately, 1998 was really not the best year to release a new FM synth—even one that sounded this good. This, combined with its relatively complex architecture, ensured it went out of production after only a year or so. It has since gone on to become a kind of lost classic, with high prices to match. It is, no doubt, a unique synth.', 'In the 1970s, the two biggest synthesizer manufacturers in the United States (and possibly the world) were Moog and ARP. And yet by the end of the decade, Moog would have lost its founder, Robert Moog, and ARP would be on its way to bankruptcy. So what happened? The Moog story is better left for another day, but ARP’s troubles are often attributed to the Avatar.', 'Released in 1977, the Avatar was ARP’s guitar synthesizer—a hybrid instrument that they hoped would revolutionize the music industry. Who wouldn’t want to play an Odyssey MKIII with their guitar? Almost $4 million was spent on research and development and initial production, yet only a handful of Avatars were ever sold. What went wrong?', "The Avatar’s guitar interface was not foolproof. It relied on a hexaphonic pickup to change incoming notes into square waves that could be used to trigger notes. However, there was a significant delay when playing lower notes. It's also monophonic and required a very clean picking style to work properly.", 'Despite some interesting and unique features (like the hexaphonic fuzz circuit), and positive word-of-mouth generated by a great demonstration at NAMM, guitarists just couldn’t be convinced to drop $3,000 on one. With only about 300 made, the Avatar has become a collector’s item, with most people using it as a normal synthesizer via CV/gate control rather than as it was intended.', 'In the late 1980s, the word on every producer’s lips was "sampling." Sequential Circuits was one of the first companies to make sampling affordable with its 12-bit Prophet 2000 keyboard and 2002 rackmount version. Praised for their sound quality, they put high-quality sampling within reach of project studios.', 'In 1987, Sequential were poised to do the same with 16-bit sampling, this time with the Prophet 3000. It had sampling rates up to 48kHz, expandable memory up to eight megabytes, auto pitch-mapping and looping, and more. There was an analog filter for warming up samples and even a detachable faceplate, something Akai would borrow a few years later for its S6000 sampler. In their cover story review, Sound On Sound magazine said, "The Prophet 3000 may well be so far ahead of the competition that they never catch up."', 'Despite a favorable launch and hints of expandability and a larger, digital product line to come, only about 250 units of the Prophet 3000 were produced. What happened? Sequential Circuits were forced to go out of business. Dave Smith blames "an ill-fated decision to move into computer audio and sound in 1985–86. We were too small and under-capitalized, and we were a few years too early in the market. It drained our resources, so by the time we pulled back to professional instruments (Prophet 2000 sampler, the VS, and the Studio 440), it was too late."', 'Sequential Circuits was bought by Yamaha, and Dave Smith and his team moved over to the Japanese company. Rumor has it that the Japanese-only Yamaha A7000 sampler released not long after was based on the Prophet 3000, although the A7000 is also rare.', 'The American company Ensoniq entered the market in 1985 with its Mirage sampler. It was one of the first truly affordable sampling keyboards and, despite its low bit rate, it was a hit and helped put them on the map. Over the next decade or so, the company released a staggering number of forward-thinking samplers and digital synthesizers, and yet the Fizmo—its crowning achievement—failed to make much of a mark at the time.', 'The Fizmo employed what Ensoniq called Transwave synthesis, wavetables of layered sound data. These harmonic layers progressed naturally and could modulate over time. It had an utterly unique (if not terribly warm) sound. With eight simultaneous oscillators across four presets, eight LFOs, resonant and non-resonant multimode filters, plus 41 digital effects, this was a serious machine. Additionally, every programming function had its own knob or button, making it very hands on.', 'With all of this going for it, the Fizmo only shipped about 2,000 units. As with the Yamaha FS1R (above), the market had moved on. People wanted the Roland JP-8000 and analog modeling. Those units that did sell were hampered by bad power supplies and an unfortunate reliance on a third-party computer program for editing some parameters. Thanks to its unique sound palette, the Fizmo is now revered for the unique instrument it is.', 'In 1981, Wolfgang Palm and his company PPG released the Wave, a revolutionary digital synthesizer that used wavetables to store single-cycle sampled waveforms. Despite its high price tag, it was immensely popular, and the technology developed for it is still in use in hardware and software synths today.', 'Five years later, Palm hoped that his latest creation, the Realizer, would again capture the cutting edge of digital music synthesis. Alas, it proved to be too far ahead of its time. About 10 years, it turns out, which is how long it took for Steinberg to debut the VST format.', 'The Realizer was essentially a proprietary music production computer. Bearing the same distinctive blue and white color scheme of the Wave instruments, and looking like a terminal from a 1980s sci-fi movie, it was capable of producing, emulating, processing, recording, sequencing, and mixing sound, all digitally. It featured analog modeling (it could apparently do a Minimoog), FM, wavetable, and sampling, with the modeled instrument appearing on the screen and its parameters controlled by the knobs that surrounded it.', 'PPG dissolved in 1987 due in part to the outlay necessary for R&D, and the Realizer (slated to retail at a whopping $65,000) never saw the light of day. Two prototypes were apparently made, however, with one selling for $50,000 in 2012.', '"Too weird to live, too rare to die." Hunter S. Thompson was talking about his lawyer, Dr. Gonzo, but he may as well have been referencing the Crumar Spirit, a bonkers monosynth released by the Italian instrument company in 1983 and designed by Bob Moog, Jim Scott, and Thom Rhea, all of Moog Music.', 'At first glance, the Spirit looks like any number of other monophonic synthesizers released in the pre-MIDI days. With its black face and wood panels, it even looks vaguely Minimoog-ish. And while at first glance it may appear similar, it is much, much more complicated than Moog’s more famous synth.', 'The Spirit’s synthesis architecture reads like a keyboard engineer’s fantasy come to life: two oscillators, with unusual options for uncoupling oscillator B from keyboard tracking, dual multi-mode filters with separate signal paths (including distortion and formant options), a flexible VCA, a pair(!) of complex modulation paths called Mod X and Shaper Y, and plenty more as well. It’s like Moog and company made a list of the most outrageous things they could think of just to see how far they could push it, and Crumar said yes to all of them.', 'However, only 100 to 300 units were ever made. Certainly the fact that it was a monosynth in 1983 had something to do with it, but Crumar was also facing an uphill battle against its reputation as makers of cheap organs and home keyboards. It would take a few more decades for the Spirit to be recognized as a maverick monosynth worth hearing.', '', 'About the author: Adam Douglas is a musician and synthesizer fan based in Tokyo, Japan.

Akai's MPC2000 and MPC2000XL had become the go-to samplers/drum machines for both novice and professional hip-hop producers. Major brands like Yamaha and Korg were releasing samplers and synth/workstation hybrids armed with powerful sound engines and sequencers.", 'Roland, a company who had held its own as a cutting-edge instrument developer for decades, would not be left out. With the MC-505, Roland set about the task of combining classic Roland instruments like the TR-808 and 909 drum machines as well as the TB-303, Juno, and Jupiter synths into a single, standalone workstation. Released in 1998, the Roland MC-505 Groovebox was a notable improvement on the power and functionality of its predecessor (the MC-303) released two years earlier.', 'Along with its 512 internal sounds, 26 drum kits, and three independent effects processors, the 505 also boasted 64-voice polyphony, full MIDI capability, onboard synth sounds + drums and an expanded effects engine. Vintage Synth Explorer\'s glowing review describes the 505 as "an all-in-one music machine that\'s great for DJs or anybody else who wants to create slamming dance tracks. Designed as a standalone machine, they do not work quite as well when incorporated into a multi-synth keyboard rig. It\'s perfect for beginners and advanced users, but offers the most possibility to those who will use it exclusively. By the way, in comparison to the MC-303, this is far better, especially in the quality and quantity of sounds."', "Although there was a great deal of excitement in the market surrounding the release of the MC-505, some users found the machine limiting. For starters, the unit lacked the onboard sampling capabilities of contemporary workstations like the Akai MPC or Korg's revolutionary Trinity and Triton keyboards. In an era ruled by all-in-one workstations, the 505's inability to sample made it a less-than-ideal tool for producing sample-based music genres like hip-hop, trip-hop and drum n' bass.", "With Roland's developers leaning heavily on the machine's preset sounds and patterns, a 2000 review from dancetech.com lamented the 505's limited user-memory:", '"While the 505 \'can\' hold up to 200 User patterns, 256 User patches, and 20 User drum kits, the reality is the more complex patterns, patches, and drum kits take up the small memory of the 505 very fast. Realistically, expect to be able to have 256 User patches and 20 User drum kits (because the memory for them is already allocated), and around a hundred User patterns, eight measures long that have around 6 parts each (each pattern can have up to 7 parts plus the rhythm section). 714 preset patterns 512 preset sounds, 26 preset drum kits - while on the surface this sounds groovy (pun intended), the reality is I would much rather have had more user memory. Give me the option to overwrite the presets, for instance."', "Despite its limitations, the MC-505 Groovebox is still a powerful music-making tool. There is probably no better evidence of the machine's broad capabilities than the 2000 compilation At Home with the Groovebox. Released by Beastie Boys' now-mythic Grand Royal Records, At Home with the Groovebox is a compilation with a novel premise, created under some quasi-mysterious circumstances.", 'According to the album\'s liner notes, Bill Mooney of design company Tannis Root "initiated" the project and "partnered with Grand Royal to maximize the potential and expand the scope of the project. Tannis Root and Grand Royal assembled a wish list of artists from around the globe, including early pioneers of synthesized electronic music." Each artist was allowed to keep the 505 sent to them.', "At Home with the Groovebox finds a who's who of '90s indie rockers and veteran synth musicians creating original tracks with nothing more than the 505, some external effects, and the human voice. Featuring tracks from Sonic Youth, Pavement, Beck, Sean Lennon, John McEntire (Tortoise), Air, Money Mark, Bis, and Buffalo Daughter, as well as Moog pioneers Jean-Jacques Perrey, Dick Hyman, and Gershon Kingsley, the album is a wildly eclectic showcase of creative musicians pushing against the limitations of a single piece of gear.", 'An MTV News article published around the album\'s release gets some insight from one of the artists. Air\'s Nicolas Godin said, "The Groovebox is a little toy, so we wanted to do something not serious with it. … But I think the song is quite good. It was not a problem for us; we knew that we [could] make that [kind of a] toy song. We like to have fun with instruments."', 'In that same article, Mooney explains a bit more about his intention for the record: "We had a letter which explained that we wanted the artists to approach the Groovebox with an experimental mindset." The 505 in particular, Mooney said, "interested me because it had a lot of collectible equipment on it, like the 303 bass machine and the 808 and 909 drum machines that are early hip-hop staples, [and] that sold for a lot more separately."', 'Opening with Perrey\'s "The Groovey Leprechauns," a bizarre midtempo pop-funk jam, At Home with the Groovebox gets off to a quirky start. Japanese experimental rock trio Buffalo Daughter come in out of left-field with "303 + 606 = Acid", a driving, minimal track that is the spiritual descendent of the sound laid down by great Chicago house and acid house pioneers like Larry Heard and DJ Pierre. John McEntire\'s "J I H A D" is built around a rolling 6/8 groove, synth-bass, and rich synth chords. AIR\'s "Planet Vega" is one of the album\'s clear standouts. The tune\'s slinky, half-time groove is augmented with beautiful chords and an ethereal lead melody.', 'Pavement\'s "Robin Turned 26" is the least electronic-sounding piece on the entire album. With its looped, textured drum break, the tune appears to utilize a sample, but it\'s possible that it is a stock sound with added effects processing. The Money Mark tune "Insects Are All Around Us" positions a dubby bassline and funky clavinet riff at the center of its thick, mid-tempo groove.', 'No stranger to crafting weird electronic beats, Beck turns in "Boyz", a minimal, 909-heavy electro-pop jam that could\'ve rocked NYC nightclubs like Danceteria in the \'80s. As the song\'s beat pounds away and an assortment of incidental sounds fly in and out of the mix, Beck intones flatly "Boyz… pressing million dollar buttons. Boyz… turning jams up to 11…" through a trippy vocoder effect.', 'With a handful of diverse tracks on the album\'s second half from Cibo Matto, Sonic Youth, Sean Lennon (whose gorgeous, oddball track "Winged Elephant" is another standout) and Gershon Kingsley performing a groovy version of his 1969 instrumental hit "Popcorn," At Home with the Groovebox is ultimately an intriguing listen. Some of the tracks are a bit dated, relying heavily on late-\'90s/2000s production and sound design techniques, but if the album was intended as an experiment to highlight the versatility of the Roland MC-505 and the musicians wielding it, the compilation more than succeeds in that ambition.', "As an instrument for music-making, Roland and companies such as Elektron and Novation have continued expanding on the groovebox concept. In the two-decades-plus since Roland released the MC-505, all-in-one, software-based digital audio workstations have come to dominate the studios of both novice and professional music-makers. Despite these significant changes in the market, the MC-505 and its predecessor the MC-303 continue to find homes in many producer's studio setups. The continuing popularity and utility of the MC-505 is evidenced by the number of current musicians on YouTube found singing the 505's praises and Roland's expansion of its hardware groovebox line in 2019 with the MC-101 and MC-707 Grooveboxes.", "With At Home with the Groovebox, we get a glimpse into how this forward-looking instrument sounds in the hands of some of the era's most creative musical minds.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Peterson amplifiers, made from the '80s to the early '90s, certainly deserve their place in British amp history. The top-of-the-range Petersons looked more like Mesa Boogies, with richly polished solid-wood cabinets that lent them a sophisticated appearance almost out of place on a rock stage. But that may have been one of the things that first attracted the jazz guitarists who became the main customers for these expensive, handmade amps.", 'Peterson got its name from Peter Tulett, a British distributor who previously had introduced the revolutionary "all purpose" Alligator amps to the UK market. Now he teamed up with a husband and wife team, Vic and Joan Blanche, owners of Elvic Electronics in Essex. The plan was to produce a solid-state amplifier with exceptional tonal quality, housed in a beautifully-made enclosure, and driving an Electro-Voice speaker—at the time regarded as the best you could get.', 'The Peterson line—there were heads and cabs as well as combos, and even some bass amps—found particular favor with jazz guitarists, notably in Japan, where they had a healthy following. They were quite widely exported, so today you might find a Peterson amp almost anywhere.', "Peter Tulett died in 2007, but by that time the line had more or less vanished, and an attempt at a revival some years later seems to have come to nothing. Look out for the Guitar Special 100, a mahogany-cased, twin-channel combo, but don't overlook one of the fabric-covered versions just because they lack a fancy case. Sadly, like many solid-state amps, they can be difficult to service today thanks to a shortage of parts.", "Impact shot to fame just a few years after Marshall, and like that famous brand (and also Simms-Watts, for which see part two of this series) it came from the back room of a music shop—in this case Pan Music, situated in Wardour Street in the heart of London's Soho, the same street where you could find the Marquee club, the Flamingo, and sundry other notorious dives.", 'Pan was one of several important central-London music shops owned by Don Mackrill and Laurie Naiff. Faced with a demand for something more powerful than the loudest amp they could get at the time, the 50-watt Kelly—which we will come to later—Mackrill and Naiff decided to launch their own brand, and so they recruited an electrical engineer called Leslie Nye.', "The company's first amp was the all-tube Impact 60 head, and it was an instant hit. Impact gear looked good, was sold in the right shops, and sounded great. It was cleaner and louder than the rival Marshall, in part due to the company using specially designed hand-wound transformers.", 'Also involved with the early Impact amps was none other than Dave Reeves, who went on to design and work on early Sound City amps before founding his own brand, Hiwatt.', "The R&B bandleader Zoot Money helped Impact stand out from the growing crowd of small British manufacturers offering 100-watt heads and 4x12s when he specified all-white stacks for his band's Royal Albert Hall show. For a while, a white Impact stack became a must-have in the UK.", 'Ultimately, Mackrill and Naiff sold the Impact brand to the distributor Dallas-Arbiter, which soon rolled it into Sound City. Impacts are quite rare today but well worth looking for, due to their classic British tube amp tone and ease of serviceability. An Impact 60 with its very distinctive sloping control panel would be a very tempting prospect.', "Kelly never achieved the superstar status of Vox, Marshall, or Hiwatt, but the brand's (mostly) tube amps achieved some success in the UK and Europe during the '60s and '70s. In many respects they were Selmer copies, which isn't surprising, as the company's founder, John Kelly, had worked for Selmer in its Essex-based service and repair department.", "Striking out on his own in the late '60s, Kelly found success initially with 50-watt tube heads—essentially alternatives to the popular Selmer Treble 'n Bass 50—and soon was selling heads and combos with a choice of single or twin twelve-inch speakers. Kelly then branched out to offer lower-power combos, with versions for bass as well as guitar, and eventually 100-watt heads and cabs, plus, inevitably, a venture into early solid-state amplification.", "The company made far fewer amps than the big names, but its tube amps are still serviceable, aren't too hard to find, and are likely to cost less than the equivalent Selmer. For unknown reasons, the Kelly brand faded from the scene during the late '70s.", "If your eyes go misty at the sight of early Burns, Watkins, and Selmer amps, then a Fenton-Weill could prove to be the jewel in your amp-collector's crown.", 'Henry Weill is best remembered as an early partner with the guitar and amp maker Jim Burns, but he also had a fairly long career making improbably shaped guitars under the Fenton-Weill brand.', "His amps also displayed Weill's unconventional thinking, including a very early stereo tube head and a head-and-cab with storage for the head inside the cab (honestly!). There were other design oddities, such as the Black Star, a tube combo with reverb and tremolo that looked like an early-'60s jukebox sporting quilted fabric covering.", "Incidentally, readers who have come across Futurama amps, sold by Selmer to run alongside the ubiquitous Futurama guitars and basses of the early '60s, and who have assumed the amps were actually built by Selmer, might be intrigued to learn that the first all-black Futuramas (as opposed to the very collectable fake-crocodile-skin versions) were actually made by Fenton-Weill and were apparently more like re-badged Fenton-Weills than Selmers. Weill also made amplifiers for Hohner.", 'Toward the end of his career, having gone bankrupt in 1965, Henry Weill moved more into disco, lighting, and PA products before eventually retiring to Florida.', "Tom Jennings, the man who created the Vox brand, sold Jennings Musical Instruments (sometimes Industries) in the mid-'60s, having run into financial problems, and in 1967 he was unceremoniously fired by the new owners. Following a successful lawsuit against them, Jennings started again with his newly formed Jennings Electronic Industries (sometimes Developments) operating from his old stamping ground in Dartford, Kent.", "Naturally, he took with him the engineer who had created the AC30, Dick Denney. However, the first JEI amplifiers were resolutely solid-state—not a wise move, given the unreliability of that technology at the time or the growing love affair with overdriven tube amps. After a shaky start, Jennings pushed development of new amps, keyboards, and effects pedals, but it wasn't until 1970 that the company launched its tube AC40. No prizes for guessing the market they were after.", 'Following the path he had trodden with Vox, Jennings also offered a line of electronic organs, electronic rhythm and percussion units, guitars, and PA amps, but somehow the magic was no longer working. Nonetheless, by 1974 the company had a full line of amps, ranging from 15-watt combos to 200-watt heads for guitar and bass, with cabs to match.', "Jennings did not manufacture solely at the famous Dartford factory, however, because in common with Selmer, Vamp, Sound City, and (ironically) Vox, some manufacturing was undertaken for all these makers by Triumph amplification in Croydon, south London, which briefly offered its own line of all-solid-state amps in the late '60s and early '70s.", 'In need of a new look, in 1973 Jennings adopted a new JEI logo on purple-finished amps and cabs. Given the current craze for modeling and its demands for FRFR amps (Full Range, Flat Response), it\'s fascinating to note that JEI actually launched its "Flat Response" FR50 and FR100 amps—45 years too early, but a good try. Sadly, by 1975, JEI was gone, but not without having made many interesting and now pretty scarce amps. A tube AC40 today would be a very good find.', "Stewart Ward is one of the few in the music industry who can genuinely claim to have once been a rocket scientist. This may account for the startling trajectory of his Session amplifiers business, which sprang to life in 1979 with the all-tube 15:30 combo. It was a fine amp and soon earned a serious following, with users including Geoff Whitehorn (Roger Chapman's Shortlist) and Martin Barre (Jethro Tull).", "Anyone but Ward would have been satisfied with that and gone on to make more tube amps. Instead, his next product was the entirely solid-state Sessionette, launched in 1981 and still the amp for which Session is best known. Against all the odds, and just when tubes seemed completely dominant in the guitar amp market, Ward claimed his new Sessionette:75 sounded as good as a tube amp, ran cooler, would last longer, and would generally outperform anything comparable on the market. Many came to agree with him, and over 50,000 Sessionettes were produced through the '80s.", "The Sessionettes came in 1x12, 2x10, 2x12, and 1x15 versions, and despite the lack of tubes, many hard rock and blues players came to love them. Ward maintained (and still does) that there is nothing a tube can do that can't be equalled or bettered with modern solid-state technology, and he can still be found fighting his corner on social media.", 'In 1988, Ward closed Session, frustrated with the instrument business despite his success. Nine years later, however, he revived the company in a smaller, more bespoke form. Still in business today as Award–Session, Stewart Ward has produced many other amps—the Rockette is much loved, as is the BluesBaby—and a host of other products, including recording preamps and direct boxes.', "Importantly, given the problems players often encounter when trying to keep older solid-state amps serviceable, Award–Session not only repairs original Sessionettes and Ward's other products, but also updates and upgrades them, making any Award–Session amp a safe buy.", 'About the author: Gary Cooper is a journalist working in the musical instrument and pro audio fields.

In a long white dress, cinched at the waist, she walks around the dance floor as if she owns it and the camera pans to the audience looking on admiringly. The orchestra keeps pace with her as her fingers fly over the keys. It is a masterful performance.', 'And one that has been almost entirely forgotten. Indeed, even in the history of female jazz, this performance is rarely mentioned, yet it was groundbreaking at the time.', 'The woman is Dolly Jones, credited in the film as Doli Armenra, and no one who ever saw her perform doubted that she could play. Her wild talent and "hot" style of playing meant that she came to be admired by Doc Cheatham, who\'s playing she influenced, and Roy Eldridge, amongst others.', 'Dolly was born on the 27th November 1902 in Chicago, Illinois—the heartland of Jazz. Whilst some persist in proclaiming that jazz came north to Chicago via the Mississippi mud boats, after the closing of New Orleans Storyville district. The truth is that it was flourishing in Chicago years before Storyville closed.', 'It was into this hotbed of talent, where music was a way of life, that Dolly was born into relative poverty. Her mother Diyaw Jones was a trumpeter and performer, known for her pre-Armstrong style and who sometimes worked as a music teacher. Of Diyaw it is written, by Jean-Claude Baker and Chris Chase, that she was a "tiny woman, who could blow the trumpet like the archangel." She most-famously contributed to jazz history as the teacher of Valaida Snow, who could play 10 instruments to professional standards by the age of 15. Dolly\'s father also played the saxophone, which completed the musical family trio.', "Little is known about Dolly's early life, but she evidently learnt to play the trumpet at a young age. By watching her mother she largely taught herself to play and quickly showed a great aptitude for it.", 'As a family they formed the Jones Family Band, and, in 1919, worked with dancer and later civil rights activist Josephine Baker, who would later become famous for refusing to perform for segregated audiences. Baker cut her teeth with the Jones family, playing both the trombone and singing.', 'This move was a standard one for many female musicians at the time. Female instrumentalists, more often than not, formed all-women jazz bands or played in family groups. Making the leap from amateur to professional was—in music, as with most spheres in the early 20th century—difficult for women. The jazz world in particular was a difficult place with women, who faced widespread racism, sexism, and even, in some cases, physical assault.', 'As a consequence female jazz musicians in this period have often, as Sherrie Tucker writes, "Paid the price of omission, as their careers (often in separate marginalized spheres) have been routinely ignored, trivialized or considered as not real jazz by historians and journalists," simply because they tended to exist outside the male-dominated jazz scene. For women like Dolly, the very method by which they could begin to participate in jazz almost guaranteed that they would be forgotten.', "Music though was Dolly's life and she grew up on the road. Perhaps traveling around, she dreamt of emulating other female jazz musicians of the time, such as Ann Cooper—who had moved to the Big Apple to play with Joe Robichaux's Rhythm Boys—or Valaida Snow, who had embarked on a tour of Europe and Asia.", 'In the early 1920s, she formed in Kansas City the "Three Classy Misses" alongside Irene Wilson. Together they played the unusual trio of piano, violin, and trumpet—a combination that made them stand out, as women in jazz tended traditionally to be singers or pianists. Dolly travelled during the 1920s and \'30s extensively, mostly between Chicago and New York.', 'Roy Eldridge later remembered hearing Dolly play during this time. He recalled walking down the street and stopping at a club to listen to the talented trumpeter. He saw Dolly sitting inside at the bar holding her trumpet and he asked if she was waiting for her trumpeter boyfriend. She, he said, looked at him with a cool, withering look and stated simply, "I am the trumpet player."', 'This is a perfect example of the everyday sexism Jones faced whilst establishing herself as a musician. It was an insult, though, that Dolly was willing to overlook, and she and Eldridge went on to jam and discuss music on many occasions. Eldridge would later declare his admiration for her style of playing. It was around this time that Dolly met and married Jimmy "Hook" Hutchinson, himself a saxophonist, but the marriage was short-lived. Dolly continued to use the surname Hutchinson intermittently throughout her career.', 'In 1926, Dolly made history when she became the first female trumpet player to record a jazz record, as part of Albert Wynn\'s Gut Bucket Five. There seems little doubt that she was selected for her skill as there would be no other advantage of having a "token" female player in the recording studio.', 'It is hard to imagine today just how important a milestone this was for female jazz music, paving the way for others to follow in her footsteps. Though it is worth noting that few at the time knew she was the trumpet player, the importance of her recording was more important "on the ground," as people heard of it, rather than in quantifiable historical terms.', 'Two years later, she toured with Ida Cox in support of Uncrowned Queen of Blues (some believe her later record Creole Blue to be influenced by this period in her life). She went on to play the jazz chair for Lil Hardin Armstrong\'s Harem Harlicans, performing in some of the most famous jazz venues, including the Lafayette and Apollo theatres in New York City, and the Regal in Chicago. There is a tendency amongst jazz historians to treat female musicians as "perpetually emerging," as Sherrie Tucker writes; however, as we have seen, Dolly was very far from emerging by this point—she was a well respected and established professional musician.', 'So much so that in 1937 she was able to put together a show at Harlem Uproar House on 52nd Street with the (now-dated and derogatory) title "7 whites, 7 coloured, and Dolly." This show was pioneering in that it attempted—with a varying degree of success—to bridge the gap between the clubs of the jazz scene and the land of the theatre. The attempt is in itself testament to the position of respect Dolly now enjoyed amongst her contemporaries and it was whilst she was in New York, that Dolly recorded the performance for which she is most famous.', 'It was in 1937 that she was recruited by Oscar Michauex. In 1938, the Black filmmaker—famous for his willingness to address racial issues in his films—announced the completion of three new films. One of these was a musical romance called Swing!, and it is in this film that Dolly appears. Oscar Michauex famously refused to shy away from issues such as African-American job discrimination, rape, lynching, and violence. Unfortunately for Dolly, this meant that his films often fell foul of the state censors, meaning that many of his films are largely forgotten today.', 'We cannot be certain when Dolly filmed her scenes, but the autumn/winter of 1937 would make most sense, given that she was in New York at the time. Dolly has no lines in the film but her trumpet solos take centre stage and are the one remarkable feature of the film. Dolly\'s performance in Swing! does not conform to any "standard" female role of the time. She is neither clown, whore, mother, alluring dancer, nor noble savage. Instead, she appears to be exactly what she is: a brilliant musician. This portrayal for the time is quite remarkable.', 'In her first performance she is seen wearing a conservative white dress of virginal simplicity—this, in itself, is in marked contrast to the historical tendency to portray African-American women (especially in the musical field) as sexually available.', 'Confident, Dolly stands in front of the all-male band, mistress of all she surveys, as behind her Leon Cross leads her accompaniment. Dolly\'s playing style was known as "hot, being fast and syncopated with a toe-tapping rhythm."', 'There is, however, nothing here in Dolly\'s performance to detract from her music. There is none of the clown actions of Tiny Davis, nor the choreographed actions of Snow, who played on her sexuality through dance and costume. Dolly simply stands and plays, and by doing so she makes a stand for feminism over sexuality. Bud Freeman said of her performance that, "She had no affectation, no showmanship" and yet held the stage not through her sexuality but through her talent.', 'She is aware of the camera but only in the sense that she completely ignores it, going against the familiar stereotype of a woman playing to the camera. This in itself for a female jazz musician is pioneering. Dolly Jones is one of the earliest representations of a Black woman on screen who is portrayed as talented and attractive, but also chaste and modest.', 'There is no evidence to suggest that these factors were deliberate, but Dolly\'s mere presence, as Kathy Ogren writes, "Disrupted and challenged conventional racist representations of Black female jazz musicians."', "Her appearance in Swing! was the highpoint of Dolly's career. She went on to record again in 1941 with the Stu Smith Quartet, and became one of the first female jazz musicians to cut her own record, Creole Blue—though sadly none of her recordings sold well.", 'Dolly continued to play right up until her death in August 1975, though details about her later life are scarce.', 'Dolly Jones smashed barriers in the jazz world, both as the first female trumpeter to lay down a record and as the first to showcase her purely musical talent in film. Her playing was so beautiful, so visceral, that even in her known recordings her playing has been compared favorably to her hero Louis Armstrong.', "Yet she remains forgotten, for every door she opened for female musicians, she lived to see them slam back. Yet she continued to play, and she deserves to be remembered for what she was: a groundbreaking trumpet player, who wrote an important chapter in the history of women's jazz.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

The trio was chartered over a near-100,000-person crowd interspersed in front of the main stage as Oingo Boingo performed in the afternoon. Later that evening, The Police would headline perhaps their biggest show to date at the tail-end of their world tour supporting Ghost in the Machine.', 'This event was unique for several reasons. The US festival was a detrimental $12 million flop, in addition to a slew of overdoses and an unforgiving 110-degree weekend. It was also a rather unorthodox attempt to extend an olive branch to the Soviet Union during a tense period of the Cold War. But arguably the most memorable moment of the closing act’s performance was Sting’s bass. Slung over the shoulder of his yellow nylon jacket and striped shirt rested a peculiar instrument: a small, carbon-fiber bass guitar missing its headstock.', 'It was a pivotal moment for the now infamous headless bass—the Steinberger L2 model, specifically, in this case—having breached the mainstream with an endorsement from one of the biggest rock stars of the moment. Sting, known mostly at the time for playing fretless Ibanez models like the MC900, had traded in his main axes for something entirely uncanny—a bass without a headstock, shaped to resemble a small boat oar.', 'A year or so later, Rush’s Geddy Lee had begun phasing out his iconic Rickenbacker 4001 and ‘72 Fender Jazz Bass for a Steinberger L2. By 1984’s Grace Under Pressure, the two basses had been entirely replaced in favor of the L2. Later in the decade, Tina Weymouth of Talking Heads would sport a L2 in the music video for "[Nothing But] Flowers," and elsewhere on tour during the Little Creatures era, replacing her signature Hofner 500/2 Club Bass. That particular L2 currently hangs in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.', 'The patient invasion of the headless bass into popularity begs several questions: Why would three of rock music’s most innovative bass players retire their mainstays for a guitar so foreign and peculiar? What was the advantage to playing an instrument without a headstock? Or perhaps most importantly, what are its origins? Where did it come from?', 'To answer, we must look back nearly six decades to the retail boom of the electric bass, where the big bang of a central design flaw would later call for some radical experimentation and lead to a cunning design play that would later capture the imagination of the world.', 'By 1950, most live music had become bolstered by stronger electronics systems and amplifiers, leaving many bass players to helplessly compete for volume. A bright luthier and entrepreneur named Leo Fender heard the complaints of industry players and decided to spearhead the creation of a portable, electronic, and slickly designed bass guitar, largely modeled from Fender’s Telecaster design. And so, in all of its stoic glory, the electric bass had hit the market, and music changed forever.', 'By the mid-1970s the use of the electric bass in popular music had drastically evolved. Whereas the initial electric basses were intended to mimic the muted sound of an upright bass, the musical zeitgeist had shifted into a more streamlined, pop-driven sound that called for a brighter bass tone. Players began applying thickly coiled strings and plugging into stronger amplifiers while playing with picks and primitive stompboxes. But many of these "enhancements" brought to the surface an interesting design flaw embedded deep in the framework of the electric bass.', 'Gene Fields, a research and development employee for Fender Musical Instruments, was tasked in 1975 with eliminating the dead spot—a particular location on the guitar’s neck where the resonant frequency causes specific notes to have a shorter sustain. According to a story printed in Vintage Guitar back in 1997, Fields’ experimentation launched him to unexplored territory, going as far to create a solid aluminum neck and even fastening a clunky C clamp to the headstock for added weight. His results were varied and ultimately unhelpful; the dead spots were simply shifting around the neck, jumping from one fret to the next in an elusive game of cat and mouse.', 'At the height of his investigation, Fields removed three strings from a stock Precision bass, detached the remaining machine heads and began sawing off the headstock one inch at a time. Each inch of wood removed caused the dead spot to rise up the neck. Fields continued systematically decapitating the headstock until just one inch of wood remained above the neck, drilled a hole at the top of the neck, and strung the bass string upside down so the ball-end was fastened at the top; a clamp was used at the bottom of the bass to tighten the string. Ultimately, in this mangled iteration of a Precision Bass, the dead spot had elevated past the 14th fret—beyond any cause for concern.', 'Fields had inadvertently invented the world’s first headless guitar, a groundbreaking Fender prototype whose existence was sadly hampered by a timid marketing team resistant to the task of bringing something so radical to the playing field. It was shelved before production, and Gene Fields subsequently held onto it until his death in 2014.', 'Meanwhile in 1977, Ned Steinberger was making custom furniture and cabinets in the industrial underbelly of Brooklyn when he met fellow woodworker Stuart Spector, a luthier and cofounder of Spector Guitars. Steinberger, keen to expand his design experience, offered to design a new bass for Stuart’s collection, prompting the creation of the elegantly curved, neck-thru-body-constructed NS-1 bass guitar, which remains a popular mainstay in Spector’s canon to this day.', 'While sourcing unconventional materials to pursue his newfound interest as an instrument designer, Steinberger met engineer Bob Young, who hipped Steinberger to the idea of carbon-fiber. The revelation to create an instrument made from lightweight carbon-fiber dawned on him quite quickly, but unlike the madcap experiments of Gene Fields, Steinberger’s decision to remove the headstock had little to do with the sonic temperament of the instrument and more to do with his desire to design something innovative, ergonomic, and daringly minimalist. After all, Steinberger was a designer at heart, not a luthier—or even a musician at that.', 'The first prototype Steinberger headless bass was built in 1977, and unlike its sleek, futuristic L-series descendents, the prototype was rather harsh and industrial in its appearance. Nonetheless, Steinberger managed to garner interest in his creation, most notably with Hap Kuffner, cofounder of Mandolin Brothers, who would later convince a begrudging Steinberger to get into the instrument manufacturing business (Ned was interested in simply licensing designs to manufacturers at the time).', 'Two years later, Steinberger designed the L2 bass and sold several prototypes at the National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM) summer show. The buyers, including bass titans John Entwhistle and Tony Levin, proved to Steinberger that the market extended beyond luthiers and entrepreneurs—bass players were also in play. Thus, Steinberger was awarded a patent for the L2 bass, and Steinberger Sound Corporation was founded a year later in 1980.', '1981 proved a momentous year for the headless bass. The L2 was featured at Musikmesse Frankfurt—a dazzling, cutting edge international music industry fair—and captured audiences with its peculiar design. Later in the year, the International Designers Society of America awarded the L2 with the Industrial Designers Excellence Award. By the year’s end, Time Magazine had declared the Steinberger L2 one of the "Five Best Designs of 1981." Fast-forward six months, to the 110-degree scorcher in San Bernardino, California, where Sting wielded his brand new L2 in front of a crowd of 100,000 strong. The headless bass had captured the world’s attention.', 'Since the peak of its success, Steinberger Sound began production on six-string guitars and other string instruments and eventually sold to Gibson in the late 1980s. Ned Steinberger now makes his own signature NS instruments. Throughout the years, a handful of guitar companies began producing their own lines of headless basses and guitars—Ibanez’s EHB series, the Kiesel Vader series, and a slew of other independent ventures—and many players have taken a turn with their headless counterparts, a list that includes Bill Wyman, Maurice Gibb, Cliff Williams, Fat Mike of NOFX, Curt Smith of Tears for Fears, and Eddie Van Halen.', 'Be that as it may, the uncanny legacy of the headless bass can be traced back to the workshops of Gene Fields and Ned Steinberger—where imposing sonic frequencies had been subdued and a flash of creativity and innovation turned the design world on its head, resulting in the uncanny headless bass: the anti-hero of the bass world, propelled to the main stage into the sturdy hands of a rock and roll star.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

community of beatmakers who use the small but powerful instrument both in the studio and during live sets.', "Given the meteoric rise in popularity the 404 has experienced over the past five to 10 years, it's worth asking the question: How did this sampler become such a global phenomenon, despite modest initial commercial success and a relatively slow adoption from the producer community?", 'When Roland introduced its MS-1 digital sampler in 1995, Sound on Sound writer Derek Johnson told readers to "get ready for what may be the first example of true sampling democracy."', "Though the MS-1 never quite made the dramatic impact he predicted, Johnson's intuition was relatively spot on. Roland's bedroom studio–sized sampler paved the way for its Boss/SP series—a lineup of small, portable sampling devices that revolutionized sample-based music.", "After the release of the MS-1, Roland's Boss eventually unleashed the SP-202 in 1998. The 202 initially found its footing in recorded rap music and instrumental hip-hop when Anticon label co-founder and DJ/producer Odd Nosdam used it to produce the entirety of cLOUDDEAD's well-received 2002 self-titled debut.", 'A few DJs and producers also used the 202 in live setups, but the SP series didn\'t achieve widespread visibility until Madlib gave the 303 (released in 2001) a shoutout at a 2002 Red Bull Music Academy lecture in Brazil. During his travels to Brazil, the Stones Throw icon also made "Rhinestone Cowboy," "Raid," and "Strange Ways" for the classic 2004 MF DOOM collaboration Madvillainy with his 303, a portable turntable, and his hotel room cassette deck.', 'After the release of the SP-505 (a favorite tool of producer/vocalist Pursuit Grooves) and the unveiling of the 606 (another preferred Madlib unit), Roland introduced the SP-404 in 2005. Their company website celebrated the release by promising to enhance everything artists loved about the earlier models.', 'MC and producer Jneiro Jarel, perhaps best known for his 2012 MF Doom collaboration, Key To The Kuffs, may hold the distinction as the first artist to utilize the 404 on an official release with Three Piece Puzzle. In a glowing 2005 writeup for RapReviews, writer Tom Doggett praised the Three Piece Puzzle track "Get Yuh Own" by noting that it, "sounds almost like a Madlib production, with thick distorted bass and minimalist drums," a compliment that hints at likely SP usage.', 'Other events were also taking place that helped propel the 404 towards the vaulted status it holds today. For one, the late J Dilla released his Donuts album on Stones Throw Records in 2006. Mostly created in his hospital bed with a stack of 45s, an SP-303, and a portable turntable—and released on his 32nd birthday just three days before his untimely passing—the critically revered album added to the growing lore of SP samplers.', "The gritty yet beautiful textures on Donuts also led to a much-increased demand for instrumental hip-hop, an emerging subgenre that had already been on the rise for quite a while thanks to DJ Krush's Krush (1994), DJ Shadow's Endtroducing..... (1996), Pete Rock's PeteStrumentals (2001), and several other compelling beat-focused projects.", 'Meanwhile, the social media platform Myspace provided a pre-Bandcamp space for aspiring beatmakers to share their instrumentals and exchange beats with their peers during the mid and late-Aughts. 404 early adopters like Roland ambassador Dibiase, Mello Music Group artist Elaquent, Mutant Academy member Ohbliv, and countless others used the platform to connect with other members of an expanding global beatmaking community.', 'Perhaps the single greatest shift in 404 culture, however, took place in 2006 with the inception of the Low End Theory, a weekly event at The Airliner venue in Lincoln Heights, Los Angeles. Founded by veteran DJ, engineer, and producer Daddy Kev in 2006, the event soon became a go-to spot for 303 and eventual 404 aficionados like Dibiase, the late Ras G, Brainfeeder record label founder Flying Lotus, Samiyam, and Tokimonsta.', "The event took on an almost mythical quality for those who were never able to attend before it shut down two summers ago, simultaneously cementing the SP-404's status as a go-to live performance tool thanks to earth-shattering live sets by Ras G and company.", "While the Low End Theory is perhaps the US beat showcase and one most responsible for birthing and enhancing 404 culture, live shows like L.A.'s Beat Cinema, Atlanta's Controllerise, Boston's Nightworks, and many others deserve a nod for providing nurturing creative environments for 404 users.", 'Not long after the foundation of Low End Theory, Flying Lotus moved into the Das Bauhaus apartment building in the San Fernando Valley alongside eventual Brainfeeder label manager Adam Stover. Producers Samiyam and Teebs also took up residence there a short time later, making the complex ground zero for experimental sample-based music. Flying Lotus eventually founded his Brainfeeder label in 2008 and it soon became a landing pad for some of the most diverse and eclectic instrumental releases around.', 'When Samiyam released Rap Beats, Vol. 1 in 2008 as the storied label\'s very first release, it officially put Brainfeeder on the map, while the audience for the record grew rapidly in size and scope over the years. In 2011 the label took to Twitter to celebrate the fact that Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke was a fan of the track "Sideways."', 'Though there\'s no verification available online as to whether or not the 404 was used on Samiyam\'s debut, the SP quickly became a central part of his creative process. "This is what I do everything on though," he said in a 2012 video interview with Behind Closed Doors. "The 404. This is the one right here. Everything goes in there."', 'The same year Brainfeeder formed, Ethan Diamond launched Bandcamp—a move that proved to be another hugely important technological innovation for beat/404 culture. The artist-friendly digital music and merchandise platform made an ideal home for smaller instrumental label projects like Rap Beats, Vol. 1 and self-released producer albums. It also introduced the beat tape album format to new listeners.', '"Second generation" Low End Theory producer Jonwayne also used the 404 early and often in his career, with much of his early work was pieced together in a makeshift bathroom studio. "Synthesizer sits on top of pulled-out drawers, 404 goes on one side of the sink and a turntable goes on the other side," he told Lainna Fader in a 2012 Resident Advisor interview.', 'Upon mastering the ins and outs of the 404 he used his machine to create the sought-after 2009 underground releases 404 Blueberries, 404 Madness, and 404 Rawberries, as well as his 2012 404SX/iPad project Jonwayne Fucks Disney.', 'Though the 404 certainly wasn\'t "mainstream" yet in 2009, it did feature on releases outside of the beat tape and instrumental hip-hop world. Animal Collective used both the SP-404 and the 555 on their universally acclaimed 2009 release, Merriweather Post Pavilion. It is perhaps most audible on "Daily Routine," where the group and producer Ben Allen chained multiple 404s together to maximize the effectiveness of their effects.', 'SP culture showed no signs of slowing down at the dawn of a new decade, as 404 enthusiast Teebs\' 2010 debut album, Ardour, gave the Brainfeeder label another critically acclaimed entry in their catalog. Described by Rory Gibb of The Quietus as "a lush, sumptuous record," Teebs showed listeners that even mundane everyday noises could sound beautiful when run through an SP.', 'Like the previous releases of Jonwayne and Samiyam, he was also drawn to the numerous effects on the SP interface that give producers limitless sound-altering potential. "I record everything into there and keep re-affecting it there and then into a computer," he said in a 2010 NPR interview. "I\'ve used tape peeling off something and the door-slamming of a microwave before."', '2,500 miles northeast of LA in Guelph, Ontario, Elaquent was using the 404 to accent his FL Studio beats by running his computer audio into the SP. "I\'d just be fucking around, improvising, and playing effects to beats I was working on," he says. "I\'d record whichever ideas I thought stuck."', 'His 2010 Persona project in particular features a wide range of SP effects tastefully accenting beautiful tracks like "Cloud 8" and "Deep Slumber." That said, while Elaquent praises the sampler for being an important live performance tool and a way to enhance his production, he never used it as a sole means of production like some of his producer peers and is currently taking a 404 hiatus due to his unit\'s disrepair. "It was always a sampler first for me, effects module second, performance tool third, and I guess as an actual sequencer, that was way way at the bottom of the list," he says.', "SP-303 and 404 originator and early adopter Dibiase—who helped mastermind Roland's official 404 Day and subsequent mini-documentary Beat Culture & the SP-404: Dibia$e, Flying Lotus and Ras G with his wife/fellow SP user Nas Rockwell—also enjoys pairing his 404 with different DAWs to give his computer productions a bit of added punch.", 'Though he made much of his excellent 2011 effort Swingology101 with the program Reason 5, you can still hear the 404 on the album providing important textures to his beats if you listen carefully. "I\'ll make a beat on Reason and then run it through the 303 or 404 for its compression to dirty it up," he said in a 2013 Micro-Chop interview.', 'A master at combining the 404 with a variety of DAWs and samplers, Dibi also uses his Twitter feed to showcase his innovative 404 beatmaking videos to great acclaim. Given the fact that he purchased his first 404 unit for $50 and a beat, it is remarkable that his near 15 years of SP usage helped make him a face of the Roland brand while giving the SP-404 its own official day.']])

From its earliest days at Kent State University amid the anti-Vietnam protests, to the band's 2010 album, Something for Everybody, Devo pushed itself to the extreme frontiers of pop music.", 'This experimental ethos could be heard in the idiosyncratic punk of their 1977 track "Gut Feeling" (as heard on Wes Anderson\' The Life Aquatic), as well as in the goofy synth pop of "Whip It," with its lyrics inspired by the parody songs and poems in Thomas Pynchon\'s novel Gravity\'s Rainbow. The band could always be found traveling just ahead of the cultural and musical curve.', "In the studio, Devo used all sorts of instruments, especially of the electronic variety. Indeed, Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh was one of the early adopters of the Moog Minimoog Model D synthesizer. Like many bands of the 1980s, Devo later notably adopted the Fairlight CMI digital synthesizer and sampler for much of its mid-'80s output.", 'What follows is an exploration of the synths used by Devo, and the studio techniques they used from the late 1970s into the early 1990s.', "Like any synth pop or new wave band of the 1980s, Devo's synthesizer arsenal is full of many and varied instruments. As hinted at above, Devo's entry into the world of electronic instruments came via the Moog Minimoog Model D.", "Mothersbraugh acquired his first Model D in the mid-'70s and quickly took to incorporating it into Devo's early sonic oeuvre. Rather than exploring the ambient sounds of Brian Eno and Cluster, or synthesized bombast of prog rock bands like Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Devo opted for sounds that called attention to themselves in rather abrasive ways.", '"I was looking for sounds that I thought were relevant to our place in time—1971, 1972—and for me it was V-2 rockets and mortar blasts, stuff that reflected what I was watching on the evening news," Mark Mothersbaugh told Sound On Sound in a 2010 interview. "I also wanted to find the sounds that were in the most subversive music that was out at the time, which wasn\'t anything to do with pop music. It was totally opposite to that: It was TV commercials. Commercials were doing things that were much further out than pop music was. Pop music seemed tame by comparison."', 'In a 2016 interview with NPR, Mothersbaugh said that the Model D allowed bands to move out of the "lab coat" environment of modular synthesis and into the environment of nightclubs. Both in the studio and music venues, the band could use the synth to create "ugly" and "aggressive" tonalities.', '"Because that\'s where I came from," Mothersbaugh told NPR. "I was at Kent State when the shootings happened. And what we were observing was not evolution but de-evolution... so those kinds of sounds were important to us."', 'In a 2013 Reddit AMA, Devo\'s Gerald "Jerry" Casale recalled the band also used a "broken" ARP Odyssey, a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5, and "possibly" an Electronic Dream Plant Wasp on its first two albums: Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo! and Duty Now for the Future.', 'Both the Odyssey and Prophet-5 were popular synthesizers among new wave, post-punk, and electronic groups of the late \'70s and early \'80s, while the Wasp would be an ideal synth for Devo\'s aggressively idiosyncratic and "ugly" sounds.', "In 1972 or '73, the band's first drummer, Jim Mothersbaugh, much like Kraftwerk, built his own electronic drum kit. In the 2010 SOS interview, Mothersbaugh described his brother's DIY electronic kit:", '', '', "Outside of Devo devotees, it's a little-known fact that Jim Mothersbaugh went on to work for Roland throughout much of the 1980s, helping to develop MIDI devices. This connection also ensured the band had a nice supply of Roland gear (more on this below).", "Jim's drums weren't the band's only experiments in DIY builds. Jim and Mark Mothersbaugh built modular synths from kits sold by PAiA Electronics].", '"For 19 bucks you could buy an oscillator from this company in Oklahoma, and then you\'d have to solder all the parts together," Mothersbaugh told SOS. "It was like a little electronic kit project. And then you\'d get a VCF and then you\'d get an envelope and you\'d get another oscillator and a rudimentary patchbay. This stuff was all of the lowest calibre electronics and packaging, but it was so cool because you were custom-building your own synth. That seemed really space-age and very liberating, the idea that the pathway of the signal wasn\'t already predetermined by ARP or Moog or Roland."', 'Notions of liberation from Moog signal paths aside, Devo also famously appeared in an ad for the Moog Liberation, an analogue polyphonic keytar-style synthesizer. The Liberation was on the song "Girl U Want," and appeared in most promo shots of the band in 1980.', 'By the mid-1980s, Devo began to move away from analogue synthesizers. Instead, Mark Mothersbaugh became one of the more famous users of the Fairlight CMI, the iconic sampler, digital synthesizer, and sequencer. The band used the Fairlight extensively on their 1984 album, Shout. Listen to "Growing Pains," a brilliant track on an otherwise middling album, and the Fairlight is all over it. It also featured heavily on Devo\'s 1988 album, Total Devo.', '"This was 8-bit, so it was pretty low quality to begin with, but they were samples of real instruments," said Mothersbaugh in a 2019 interview. "And so I really liked that. I liked the idea of having the ability to blend acoustic instruments in along with my synth tracks."', "Although the Fairlight came to dominate Devo's sound, Mark Mothersbaugh told Sound On Sound in 2010 that every album features the Minimoog. Other synths used by Devo throughout the years include an Oberheim Two-Voice (for 2007's Something for Everybody), a Roland SVC-350 Vocoder, and a Linn LM-1.", "In Devo's early years, they were also fond of synthesizers by Electronic Music Laboratories. Devo used the EML 500, a portable monophonic synth that was the company's answer to the Minimoog and Odyssey, as well as the EML Poly-Box. The Poly-Box is a truly strange piece of analogue gear—a keyboard controller that could essentially control another analogue synth, and make it polyphonic across an entire chromatic octave.", "Mark Mothersbaugh also used a Memorymoog, given to him by Bob Moog, which featured circuitry and sounds not found in the synth's eventual production line. And according to fansite Devolution Accelerated, Devo made use of the Moog Source, a monophonic synth with membrane keypads, on their albums New Traditionalists and Oh No! It's Devo, and used it on tour for the former album.", 'The band also used a Roland D-50, a digital synth similar to the Yamaha DX7, on its late 1980s albums, Total Devo and Smooth Noodle Maps (1990), as well as the accompanying tours. And in the music video for "Time Out for Fun," off of Devo\'s 1982 album, Oh, No! It\'s Devo, the band can be seen playing Roland SH-101 in keytar mode.', "Devo's early recordings were made on a TEAC 4-track reel-to-reel tape recorder. Using the 4-track, the band layered guitars, the Minimoog, Jim Mothersbaugh's DIY electronic drum kit, and bass guitar onto magnetic tape.", '"When we only had a four‑track TEAC to record on, we were like \'Okay, the guitar player has to be able to do the solo and leave whatever he\'s doing and then come back to whatever he\'s doing to support the song,\'" Mothersbaugh told Sound On Sound. "So everybody had to constantly be doing something important. That\'s the side of technology where you get lured into constantly piling stuff on."', "In 2016, Mothersbaugh elaborated on Devo's early 4-track recordings in an interview with The Detroit Metro Times.", '"It meant everyone pretty much had one track for their instrument," said Mothersbaugh. "You had to play something essential or not play at all. I think that made us think about the music in a really interesting way that involved reductive synthesis. What happened after that is, people got access to 24 tracks, and 48 tracks, and now [with] digital recordings they can have hundreds of tracks on a song. I think that was Devo\'s downfall, that technology. While some of it went in a really good way for us, some of it went wrong, and I think multi-tracking made us make musical tracks that were less interesting."', "For their debut album, Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!, Devo was supposed to have David Bowie, a big fan of the group, as the record's producer. But, because of movie commitments, Bowie couldn't take the gig, so Brian Eno stepped in. By 1977, Eno was transitioning from his post-Roxy Music experimental pop phase to ambient music, which included a collaboration with the iconic German electronic duo Cluster. With the band's herky-jerky rhythms and abrasive sounds, Eno obviously wasn't the greatest fit as a Devo producer.", "In a Reddit AMA, Casale recalled the group not taking any amps to Krautrock producer Connie Plank's studio in Cologne, Germany, where they recorded the album with Eno. It was a fateful decision, as Devo were forced to use Plank's Vox amps, and neither Casale and Bob Mothersbaugh were thrilled with the sound.", 'Devo, inspired by the Midwest\'s industrial brutalism, wanted an "ugly" and "aggressive" sound to accompany their confrontational live performances, all of which didn\'t really jive with Eno\'s studio wizardry. Eno\'s desire to make the sound warm and atmospheric ran headlong into Devo\'s aesthetic, which was a silly and robotic brand of synth pop.', 'One can hear this friction on "Space Junk", a perfect a blend of Devo and Eno\'s aesthetics. In the 2006 book, Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978–1984, author Simon Reynolds recalled that Devo later said of their experience with Eno: "We were overtly resistant to Eno\'s ideas. He made up synth parts and really cool sounds for almost every part of the album, but we used them on three or four songs."', "Despite the studio distjunction, Are We Not Men? sounds fantastic, even over four decades later. Because of Eno and David Bowie's involvement (when on weekend breaks from filming), the album is utterly unique in the Devo canon, and still sounds fresh.", "The disappointment with studio production would continue on their next record, Duty Now for the Future (1979). As with their debut, this record also has a Bowie connection, as the band selected Ken Scott as the album's producer. Scott had worked on Bowie's The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars, and the following record, Aladdin Sane. As Scott recalled in a 2010 interview with Mix magazine, the recording sessions typically began with bass and drum tracks.", '"Everything else was overdubbed afterward," Scott recalled. "So if we had to manipulate things, we could."', 'On Duty Now, the guitars sound great, with a variety of tonalities. For the guitar solo on "Secret Agent Man", Scott recalled overloading mic amps and feeding the signal through headphones, which were taped to a mic. Devo and Scott did a lot of manipulating of guitars so that the sounds weren\'t like traditional electric guitar.', '"A guitar can only do what a guitar does. It\'s like only one tiny piece of a synthesizer," Jerry Casale said in a 1979 interview with Bam magazine. "On this album, we did much more with the guitars, too. Sometimes you don\'t know that they\'re guitars."', "Scott and Devo also experimented with different drum kits on Duty Now. As Scott noted on a Duty Now thread on Steve Hoffmanm Music Forums, they wanted to get different sounds for each of the record's tracks.", '"Certainly most of the time it would have been my usual setup, U 67s or U 87s on toms, RE20 on bass drum, KM 54 or KM 56 on snare and the overheads I have no idea," said Scott. "They\'ve changed consistently over the years. Oh yes there would also have been a couple of distant mics, probably C 12 As, though not 100% sure."', "Since the record was made at Chateau Recorders studios, Scott could leave the studio doors open during recording. This allowed him to place one mic in the studio's foyer, which was made of Spanish tile, and one in the bathroom or the kitchen.", '"I had to tell everyone who worked there, we\'re going to be recording, so please keep the noise down," said Scott. "All the phones had to be turned off whilst we were doing takes, but that gave an amazing distant mic\'ing. The studio was dead, but you could always open up that door and put the mics out there."', "In the Reddit AMA, Casale said that while he loves the songs, he thinks Scott's production took away some of Devo's edge. Perhaps there is something to this perception, as Duty Now has a very clean and precise production. Scott, of course, cut his engineering and producing teeth at Abbey Road studios, working on The Beatles' mid-to-late '60s albums. That said, perhaps more than on any other Devo record, Scott seems to have brought out the band's innate musicality, which could often get lost in the maelstrom of sound they loved to create.", "For Freedom of Choice, Devo enlisted Robert Margouleff, a record producer known chiefly for his work with Stevie Wonder. Margouleff's resume appealed to Devo because they wanted to make an R&B-style record. But perhaps another factor in Devo's decision to work with Margouleff is that he was a member of the experimental electronic duo Tonto's Expanding Head Band, which made some wonderfully trippy music in the early 1970s (see: Zero Time).", '"We were into Bootsy Collins and Prince," said Mark Mothersbaugh in an interview with Magnet magazine in 2016. "But we couldn\'t quite make out what our take on that soul sound would be. We grew up loving Motown. That\'s probably how we came to Margouleff, because Stevie Wonder was ubiquitous, and he was a giant of electronic music. The underground film world, too, when you consider he lived with and produced that Edie Sedgwick movie."', '"We set out to make Freedom Of Choice with an R&B feel, and that\'s what we got," said Bob Mothersbaugh in the same interview. The album, which features "Whip It," is far from R&B, although it\'s funky and moves in a way that its two predecessors do not. It would be more accurate to say that with Margouleff at the mixing desk, Devo produced a catchy synth pop album that proved to be their mainstream breakthrough.', 'In a 2018 interview with Sound On Sound, Margouleff said that no two tracks were recorded alike. He added that the drums were generally recorded with an RE20 on the kick drum, a Shure SM57 on the top of the snare, an SM58 underneath, a Neumann KM 84 on the hi-hat, Neumann U 87s on the toms, and AKG 414s for overheads. They also used boom mics and an RE20 on some of the vocals, and the U 87 on others.', "On Freedom of Choice, Devo recorded the synthesizers and bass via direct input (DI). For the guitars, they used a combination of amplifiers and DI. Margouleff recalled using three to four microphones per amplifier, but couldn't recall which mics they were. The producer also recalls many of the tracks were laid down in one pass as much as possible, although they did overdub when needed. Margouleff's mic'ing and DIs helped give Freedom of Choice a warm and clean sound, but still identifiably Devo—that is to say, discordant and asymmetrical, but also futuristic and playful.", 'After Freedom of Choice, Devo assumed engineering and production duties. It was as if the years working with Eno, Scott, and Margouleff were a series of apprenticeships. Now, Devo were the masters.', "On the next album, The New Traditionalists (1981), Devo mostly eschewed the guitar-driven sound of records past, pushing the synthesizers to the forefront of the mix. They also used drum machines on many of the album's tracks.", "Interestingly, the rather muddy hue of The New Traditionalists came about by accident. At the time, 3M had just released a brand-new 2-inch magnetic tape. When Devo began laying down vocals, the tape's edges began to crumble. Warner Brothers, with whom the band had always had a rather troubled relationship, refused to fund a total re-recording. Devo responded by transferring the recording to digital reel-to-reel tape, and finishing it via digital recording methods at the Record Plant in Los Angeles.", "But the sound quality isn't a major problem. The deterioration of the master magnetic tape gives The New Traditionalists a darker hue—one that matches the album's even more dystopian concept and songs.", 'Devo doubled down on their more electronic studio approach with the following year\'s record, Oh, No! It\'s Devo, which found producer Roy Thomas Baker—famous for his work with Queen on "Bohemian Rhapsody" as well as The Cars—manning the mixing board.', "Oh, No! It's Devo features even more drum machine and sequenced synthesizer tracks. By 1983, MIDI had been standardized, and it certainly sounds like Devo took advantage of this standardization in the studio, allowing them to program beats and synths (both analogue and digital) in a way they really hadn't on previous records. This, combined with the minimal use of guitars, gives the record a metronomic, roboticized feel.", 'This mechanical version of Devo isn\'t a bad thing. Listen to the track "Patterns" and it has some great guitar, sound effects, synth melodies, and singing from Mark Mothersbaugh. If someone said "Patterns" were released any time in the last 20 years, indie and electronic music fans wouldn\'t even bat an eye. And despite being heavily sequenced, "Speed Racer," a cartoonish and psychedelic track, has a looseness and asymmetrical vibe missing on other album tracks. It\'s like the offspring of Kraftwerk and Talking Heads, and hints at the collage-like sound that Art of Noise was exploring around the same time.', "On their 1984 album, Shout, Devo increasingly turned to the Fairlight CMI and LinnDrum LM2, an approach that would continue on 1988's Total Devo. For Shout, the band also incorporated the E-Mu Emulator and Synclavier II, both of which were, like the Fairlight CMI, digital synthesizers and sampler workstations.", 'As Mothersbaugh said in a 2019 interview on Medium, the Fairlight CMI changed the way he thought about music in many ways. In particular, it freed him from being in a band to being able to write "things for a film or a TV show just pretty much all by myself."', '"I didn\'t really require other people to be with me for me to be able to put it all down, because you would play right into this computer," said Mothersbaugh. "And to me, that was so transparent and so powerful. It was like, because you played it in when you had the idea. So, it really became about conceptual art, writing music to me. It became this thing that I totally understood of being able to write a piece, and then it\'s permanent into this sequence."', "Starting with Shout, and continuing with Total Devo, Mothersbaugh liked being able to use samples of real instruments to create sounds, even if the sample rate was 8-bit. He enjoyed being able to blend acoustic instruments from the Fairlight's sample library with Devo's synth tracks.", '"After working with it for a few months, I realized, \'Well, these are even better than acoustic instruments, because they sound like the wood-paneling version of real wood paneling,\'" said Mothersbaugh in the Medium interview. "You know, it sounded like vinyl wood, or sounded like a plastic brick wall version of a brick wall. It didn\'t really sound like a brick wall, but it sounded like the plastic, fake version of it. And so I loved the idea that I could write acoustic ... plastic acoustic music."', 'The Devo fansite Devolution Accelerated speculates that the Fairlight used by Devo was the expanded Series IIx, which was MIDI-equipped. The site says that it was used to presequence most of the songs on the album.', 'Mothersbaugh\'s love of the Fairlight, however, drove longtime drummer Alan Myer—the band\'s "human metronome"—from Devo. The Fairlight\'s introduction also meant further de-emphasis on the guitar, as Devo guitarist Bob Mothersbaugh recalled in a later interview. Even Jerry Casale, who like Mothersbaugh welcomed more synthesis in Devo\'s sound, eventually regretted the Fairlight-driven sound of Shout.', '"The Fairlight [synthesizer] just kind of took over everything on that record," said Casale in a 2007 interview with Billboard. "I mean, I loved the songwriting and the ideas, but the Fairlight kind of really determined the sound."', 'The band made two more albums—Total Devo and Smooth Noodle Maps—but would go on an extended hiatus in 1991.', 'While this might seem a fitting end—Mothersbaugh did say that advanced recording technology was "Devo\'s downfall"—but the band has reformed on numerous occasions since 1996 to great acclaim. And throughout the 2000s, the group has been honored by everyone from Moog to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for its numerous contributions to electronic and rock music.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

The three original guitarists were there: 19-year-old John Lennon, 17-year-old George Harrison, and 18-year-old Paul McCartney. At the start of the year they’d gained a bass player, 20-year-old Stu Sutcliffe, and now they’d added a drummer, 18-year-old Pete Best, to complete the line-up for the daunting two-month residency secured by their manager, Allan Williams. Crucially, Allan also owned the minibus.', 'Hamburg boasted a lively music scene in the bars and clubs and strip-joints that centered on a street called the Reeperbahn. None of the group had been out of the UK before, and excitement was high as they packed their gear on the roof of the little bus. John, with a casual last-minute flourish, picked up his passport on the day they were set to depart.', 'The Hamburg jaunt of 1960 marked the first of three working trips that The Beatles would make there over the next few years. The city’s clubs demanded long sets for the clientele to drink and dance to, and this fierce regime would turn the ramshackle young group into an efficient and fearless unit ready for anything. Even worldwide fame.', 'The guitar players in The Beatles had already suffered a few knockabout instruments before the Hamburg visit. Inevitably they’d begun with cheap acoustics, like most other guitarists starting to play in Britain in the late ‘50s. John’s first guitar was a Gallotone Champion flattop, George shifted from an Egmond/Rosetti flattop to a Hofner President archtop, and Paul grappled with a Zenith Model 17 archtop.', 'Soon they wanted electrics. George tried a pickup on his President, but that didn’t cut it, so during 1959 he traded the guitar with a Swinging Blue Jean for a Hofner Club 40—a single-pickup hollowbody electric made in Germany. John also got a Club 40 that year, and his was a new model that he acquired on hire purchase (credit) from Hessy’s music shop in Liverpool.', 'Paul tried sticking a pickup on his Zenith, but soon gave up on it. In summer ’60, he too dived into Hessy’s, committed himself to ten shillings a week ($1.40 at the time), and emerged with a Rosetti Solid 7 guitar, made by Egmond in The Netherlands and offered as standard with a two-pickup pickguard assembly. Paul’s left-handed style meant he played the Solid 7 “upside down.”', 'Back at the minibus, The Beatles had almost finished loading their gear for the Hamburg trip. Paul packed his Solid 7, John his Club 40, but George had a new guitar ready for the German residency.', 'Late in 1959, he’d visited the ever-busy Hessy’s and stumped up a £10 deposit for a new guitar and case, agreeing to pay 16 shillings a week (about $2.20 then) for his hire-purchase deal. The prize was a Resonet Grazioso solidbody electric made by Dřevokov in what was then Czechoslovakia—a European copy of a Stratocaster brought into the UK by Selmer, who renamed it the Futurama.', 'Stu had joined the group in January, becoming the bass player when they convinced him to spend some of the money he’d won in a painting competition as a deposit (guess which shop?) on a new Hofner 500/5 bass. Stu loaded his bass onto the Morris alongside the other guitars, a set of Premier drums, and a trio of amps by Selmer, Elpico, and Watkins. Ready to rock!', 'During their German stay, the group found time to redistribute some of the Deutschmarks they earned. Stu bought a Gibson GA-40 Les Paul amp, a combo that would soon become George’s. John bought a ’58 Rickenbacker 325, and while it had evidently been on the Hamburg shop wall for a while, it must have seemed quite a catch compared to the guitars they were used to. John called the three-pickup short-scale 325 “the most beautiful guitar,” and this first Beatle Rickenbacker would not be the last.', 'John bought an amp, too, a Fender Vibrolux, and thus became the first Beatle with that most enviable duo: an American guitar and an American amp. “You have to imagine that in those days,” George told the BBC, “when we were first out of Liverpool, any good American guitar looked sensational to us. We’d only had beat-up crummy guitars at that stage. We still didn’t really have any money to buy them, but I remember that John got that Rickenbacker … what they call ‘on the knocker,’ you know? [Money] down and the rest when they catch you! I don’t know if we ever really paid them off.”', 'The Beatles’ first Hamburg trip turned into a protracted visit full of drama—atrocious accommodation, several deportations, Stu’s decision to stay in Germany with a girlfriend—but the intense musical education they gained was of enormous value to the developing group.', 'By the time The Beatles made their second trip to Germany for three months starting in April 1961, they had begun to play regularly at the Cavern club in Liverpool, and Paul had modified his Rosetti into a “bass” with some piano strings. In Hamburg, however, Stu returned to play bass.', 'John brought his Rick 325 and Fender Vibrolux, George his trusty Futurama and Selmer Truvoice amp, Stu had his Hofner 500/5 and Gibson GA-40, Pete played his Premier kit, and Paul switched to piano. They were joined for some performances by fellow Brit Tony Sheridan, who played a Martin D-28E electric flattop, and they recorded a few tracks in Hamburg with him for the Polydor label.', 'Despite Stu’s reappearance, it seemed he wouldn’t last in the group. Paul realized how things were going, but with the Solid 7 in a less-than-solid mess, now it was his turn to go guitar-shopping in Hamburg. “It was like oh-oh, we haven’t got a bass player,” Paul told me. “And everyone sort of turned round and looked at me. I was a bit lumbered with it, really; it was like well—it better be you, then. I don’t think you would have caught John doing it, he would have said ‘No, you’re kidding, I’ve got a nice new Rickenbacker!’ I didn’t have a guitar at the time—it had been smashed up and I was playing piano on stage then—so I couldn’t really say that I wanted to be a guitarist.”', 'He found a shop in Hamburg that could get what he wanted. “I saw this violin-shaped bass guitar in the window, the Hofner,” he said. Paul bought a left-handed Hofner 500/1, a hollowbody similar to Gibson’s Electric Bass model. It was the first of a couple of Hofner violin basses he would own, and they would define his stage image during the years to come.', 'The group’s final visit to Hamburg might have seemed an anticlimax in the midst of their rapidly changing fortunes by the early months of 1962. They had a tenacious new manager in Brian Epstein, who landed them an audition with Decca at the start of the year and spruced them up with suits and ties. And this time they travelled by plane to Hamburg. Shocking news greeted them when they arrived: Stu had died three days earlier following a cerebral hemorrhage. He was just 21. It was countered by better news from Brian, who told them EMI had signed the group.', 'Meanwhile, the club they played this time in Hamburg was an improvement, too, providing a backline of Fender amps for The Beatles to use. They brought with them their current line-up of instruments, as well as Paul’s new "Coffin" speaker cabinet, custom built by Big Three guitarist Adrian Barber. John had his Rickenbacker 325 and Paul his Hofner 500/1 bass, but in the meantime George had acquired a ’57 Gretsch Duo Jet.', 'George got his Gretsch in Liverpool from a merchant seaman who’d bought it new in New York City. The sailor wanted £90 but George had only 70 with him, so he signed an IOU for the remaining money—which was never paid. But he had what he wanted. "It was my first real American guitar," George told Dan Forte in Guitar Player, "and I’ll tell you, it was secondhand, but I polished that thing. I was so proud to own that."', 'On their return home, The Beatles resumed a relentless schedule for the rest of ’62, which had them playing an ever-bulging diary of gigs and recording their first two singles for EMI. Hamburg had served its purpose as a springboard to a much bigger place. And where was that? John explained for Playboy: "In those days, when The Beatles were depressed, we had this little chant. I would yell out, ‘Where are we going, fellows?’ They would say, ‘To the top, Johnny,’ in pseudo-American voices. And I would say, ‘Where is that, fellows?’ And they would say, ‘To the toppermost of the poppermost!’"', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

It's why you create your own tone, conjure your own sounds, make your own style. And it's why some guitarists take the idea of self expression beyond their sound and into the look of their guitars.", "The trend to decorate your own guitar—or, for the well-heeled, to have your guitar decorated for you—developed rapidly back in what historians have come to term The First Psychedelic Era. Many will remember some of the most famous examples from that period, like Jimi's Monterey Strat, Eric's Fool SG, or Jimmy's Dragon Tele.", 'Paul McCartney summed up the zeitgeist: "I got out the old aerosols," he told me about decorating his Rickenbacker bass in 1967. "We did the cars, too. If you did the cars, you might as well do your guitars. It looked great, and it was just because we were tripping. That\'s what it was, man. Look at your guitar and you\'d trip even more."', "These psychedelic creations set the scene for the paint that's flowed ever since for players who want to personalize their axes and stamp their identity on an otherwise mass-produced item.", "Come the '70s, Clash main man Joe Strummer pounded out his contributions on a bashed-up Tele while his pal Mick Jones did the rest on a few Gibsons. Joe bought his '66 sunburst Tele secondhand in London for £120 in 1975, when he was in a pub-rock band called The 101ers. He joined The Clash the following year and took his guitar to a car body shop, where he had it painted black over a grey undercoat.", 'Then Joe decorated his freshly black Tele, most famously with an "Ignore Alien Orders" sticker and a "NOISE" stencil. He played it until The Clash split in the mid-\'80s, and it was a fine example of shoving on a new, more suitable color—because a pretty sunburst is So Not Punk—and then tipping in some whacky decals.', 'Woody Guthrie might not have been the first to adorn his guitar with stickers, but he was surely among the earliest to craft a handmade one with a political statement. Woody\'s dust-bowl ballads, including "This Land Is Your Land," were touted as the voice of the blue-collar worker through the American Depression of the \'30s. He embellished a few of his guitars—mostly Gibson acoustics, namely a J-45, an L-00, and an SJ—with a sticker that declared "This Machine Kills Fascists." It was a pleasing thought.', "Pete Townshend took a practical approach in the mid-'70s when he found a way to identify his batch of Les Paul Deluxes with big white Letraset numbers. Letraset was a system of sheets with letters, numbers, and symbols in various sizes and fonts that could be transferred to paper, film, guitar bodies, and whatever else you wanted to label. Pete had nine of these numbered Les Pauls, and presumably it began with a clear idea that, say, Number 3 meant one thing and Number 9 something else, such as whether it had a particular capo'd tuning. By the end of a Who tour, however, all this would have become rather more chaotic. Nice try, though, Pete.", "Eddie Van Halen set the bar for the homemade vibe with his Frankenstein guitars, which started life around 1974 when he bought some parts from Wayne Charvel. His aim was to cross-pollinate a Gibson with a Fender, because the amalgam he wanted to play didn't exist. So he took matters into his own hands.", "Eddie achieved the unique look of his original Frankenstein thanks to layers of home-sprayed paint and some deftly applied tape. And his success in the '80s gave the notion of the shed-built guitar a massive boost of popularity. All across the land, parents were busy clearing up poorly attached necks and discarded spray cans.", "Eddie's apparently haphazard decoration, a sort of criss-cross affair of white and black stripes on a red ground, highlighted a contrast that will be familiar to anyone who's considered what to do ornamentally within the confines of a guitar body. Most guitars have a body with plenty of curves. Did I say contrast? Well, why not introduce some straight lines, then? Or, in Eddie's case, make that kind-of-straight lines.", 'This leads us to Synyster Gates and his tasteful array of pinstripes. The Avenged Sevenfold guitarist worked with Schecter on a specific look for his signature models, and in particular he enjoyed coming up with different color combinations of horizontal pinstripes across the body of his (suitably) Avenger-based models. Gold on black was an early Synyster favorite. "I definitely wanted to go for the flash, but keep it classy," he told myguitarlessons, adding with a laugh: "Or as classy as it could be. In my eye, it had all those things. It stood out from the crowd, but it didn\'t look like a pimped-out \'57 Chevy."', "Synyster and Schecter understood that there's a fine line to be drawn somewhere between the madness of a totally over-the-top kaleidoscope and the restraint required to bring a touch of class to the business of personal decoration.", "Syn's horizontal scheme targets that line successfully, and the same can be said for Buddy Guy's polka-dotted Strats, say, or Zakk Wylde's concentric circles. Buddy went for his polka dots because back in the '50s he assured his mum that he'd make his fortune in Chicago and buy her a polka-dot Cadillac. She became ill and so the car never happened, but later his famous monochrome Strat became a tribute to her.", 'Keep it simple, keep it geometric, and keep that contrast. For many, those are the bywords for successful prettifying of a beautiful body. Others want to celebrate a return to the laissez-faire attitude of the original First Psychedelic Era.', 'Joseph Arthur comes on like a keeper of the flame—who nonetheless seems comfortably at home playing regular natural-finish acoustics and sunburst electrics with Ben Harper, perhaps, or Dhani Harrison. But he has an artistic streak, too, that he allows free reign in his gloriously extravagant painted creations.', "Tom Morello's fave bitser guitar rounds up many of the ideas for decorating guitars into one enthralling whole. In the '80s, he wasn't too happy with a guitar he'd bought made from parts, and he proceeded to replace everything replaceable, several times over. He ended up with a nameless graphite neck, EMG pickups, and an Ibanez Edge vibrato, but kept the original wooden body.", 'In the early days of Rage Against The Machine, Tom liked to draw hippos. Who doesn\'t? So he drew a few of those and then painted them in. Then he wrote "Arm The Homeless" on it in big letters. "I liked the juxtaposition of that kind of provocative and militant situationist slogan," he told MusicRadar, "with those four smiling hippopotamuses all facing in one direction." Woody Guthrie would have been proud.', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music. He is a co-founder of Backbeat UK and Jawbone Press.

Rather than a straight linear sequence of events, the genre's evolution has played out as the result of an interconnected web of social forces and technical innovations that have propelled the music forward.", 'When Parliament passed The British Nationality Act 1948, creating a pathway to British citizenship for people from the colonies (most notably Jamaica), the racial and cultural dynamics of England would be forever changed. In the 1950s, Jamaican immigrants brought the practice of building soundsystems to England, establishing a distinctly Afro-Atlantic culture of bass, rhythm, and spoken word in the country.', "In subsequent decades, disco, soul, jazz-funk, and hip-hop emerged and established their own unique scenes in the UK, each permanently transforming the country's music culture. When acid house touched down in the UK in 1988 during the Second Summer of Love, electronic music moved to the forefront of English popularity and cultural impact.", 'The music spread rapidly and influenced everything. Its lightspeed evolution happened likewise in urban clubs in the city and massive raves in the countryside. It was out of this volatile cultural stew—reggae, house, soul, jazz, hip-hop, and rave—that jungle first emerged.', 'As the late \'80s gave way to the early \'90s, several records came out of the UK that represented an important transitional step in the evolution from rave/acid house to jungle. In 1990, London-based duo Shut Up and Dance released "Lamborghini," a quirky track that still retained the four-on-the-floor beat of acid house, but added a sample of The Eurythmics\' "Sweet Dreams" and some choice reggae-style toasting from British reggae duo The Ragga Twins.', 'Another Ragga Twins/Shut Up and Dance release from this era, "Hooligan 69," included a dramatic sample of the intro from Prince & The Revolution\'s "Let\'s Go Crazy"—and a pitched-up sample of the drum break from Rufus Thomas\' 1971 novelty dance hit for Stax Records, "Do The Funky Penguin (Part 2)."', 'Around the same time that Shut Up and Dance was reintroducing breakbeats into the UK dance music lexicon, another duo named 4Hero was conducting similar experiments.', 'In 1990, 4Hero (a duo made up of Marc Mac and Dego, who would also release several genre-defining singles under the Tom & Jerry moniker), released "Mr. Kirk\'s Nightmare"—a bizarre, breakbeat-infused rave track that would become an unlikely hit. With its horrific sample of a phone-call where a father is flatly informed that his son has died of an overdose, the song is a surprisingly sober anti-drug anthem delivered at the height of England\'s drugging and raving heyday.', 'Musically, "Mr. Kirk\'s Nightmare" is one of the earliest examples of this new breakbeat-based dance music. Taking drum loops from Lyn Collins\' inescapable "Think" (a break that was also becoming an essential part of another burgeoning genre: Baltimore club), and Tommy Roe\'s "Sweet Pea" (a foundational break in jungle/drum and bass later), "Mr. Kirk\'s Nightmare" pointed toward a new direction for British electronic music.', "The fact that many of these DJs and producers experimenting with breaks and sampling were veterans of the soundsystems and England's Black musical community was significant. Shut Up and Dance were members of the Heatwave soundsystem alongside drum and bass pioneer DJ Hype. Marc Mac of 4hero was a member of Solar Zone. These producer/DJs would take their familiarity with Black musical forms to inject the sub bass, toasting, and hip-hop–style sampling that would be integral to jungle's early DNA.", 'More so than any other track released during this era, Lennie De Ice\'s tune "We Are I.E." is a classic. In It\'s a London Thing: How Rare Groove, Acid House and Jungle Remapped the City, author Caspar Melville points to several musical elements that make "We Are I.E." a clear forerunner to jungle.', 'He writes that the song "combines electric acid washes with a sampled breakbeat (an early use of the \'Amen\' break), a digital \'ragga\' bassline and a sampled vocal line from \'N\'Sel Fik\', a Rai song by Chaba Fadela and Cheb Sariouh." Melville also points to Rebel MC\'s 1991 release "The Wickedest Sound" as a precursor to jungle, with its dynamic reggae toasting and sampled breaks.', 'Speaking with Reverb for this piece, Marc Mac explained how soundsystem culture influenced jungle, and talked about the gear that he and Dego used to craft those early classics: "The last bit of the hardcore/jungle evolution was the use of Jamaican soundsystem live recordings on cassette tapes, giving the music more edge, and with the technology of samplers also evolving, more sample time and techniques enhanced the production."', "By the mid-'90s, jungle/drum and bass had exploded into a full-on global phenomenon. Scenes popped up everywhere, but London (as well as the immediate towns surrounding it) remained the flashpoint from which the music's influence flowed.", "Labels like 4Hero's Reinforced, Fabio's Creative Source, Grooverider's Prototype, Goldie and Kemistry & Storm's Metalheadz, LTJ Bukem's Good Looking, Tony Colman and Chris Goss' Hospital Records, and Rob Playford's Moving Shadow, and Bryan Gee and Jumpin Jack Frost's V Recordings were releasing groundbreaking singles pushing the music forward at an exponential rate.", 'As with the rave scene, several sampling techniques have animated the core of the genre\'s rapid evolution. With breaks like "Amen," "Think," "Apache," "Sweat Pea," "Funky Drummer," "Funky Mule," and others firmly established as the foundational elements of drum and bass, producers created fresh new techniques facilitated by new technology.', 'Hardware pieces like Akai\'s powerhouse S950 rackmount sampler featured a time-stretch function that allowed producers to radically alter the tempo and pitch of an audio sample. This effect was used to manipulate breaks and create the kind of odd, metallic-sounding timbre to vocals on tracks like Dred Dred\'s 1994 classic "Dred Bass."', 'In Brian Belle Fortune\'s 2004 book All Crews: Journeys Through Jungle/Drum And Bass Culture, Foster details DJ Flapjack working on a track in the studio, showing the simple setups of samplers and computers that were being employed to make jungle records at the time. According to Foster, Flapjack\'s setup included "Yamaha NS-10m studio monitors, an E-Mu e5000 Ultra sampler, a Behringer DDX 3215 automated mixing console, and Cubase SX software."', 'In the same passage, Rohan of Bassbin Recordings explains how junglists were creating this radical sample-based music on very minimal setups. "We\'ve got just the basics: a sampler, computer, and a mixing desk. The software revolution now means you can scrap most of the hardware and make tunes using one computer."', 'Marc Mac gives an insight into the gear that he and Dego were utilizing in the \'90s: "Our early studio was built around the Akai S950 and Atari 1040 running Creator and Notator, a Fostex four-track cassette recorder, and a Sony DAT machine. Also had a Roland TR-808, TR-606, 727, Yamaha SY22, and Juno-106."', "In addition to hardware samplers like the S950, E-Mu's e5000 and the Emax, Roland's W-30 sampling keyboard workstation, and more, jungle producers had fully embraced two newly released home computers that hit the market in the mid-'80s and provided endless inspiration for a generation of producers.", 'In 1985, Atari released the 520ST. The model would become a key instrument in the production of rave and jungle/drum and bass. In his fascinating 2017 Redbull Music Academy piece on the AtariST, writer/DJ Matt Anniss explains that the inclusion of MIDI capabilities in the 520ST made the computer a logical choice for the type of complex music being created by electronic musicians at the time:', '"What made it so attractive to budding computer musicians though, was the computer\'s MIDI capability. The ST was the first computer to come with MIDI \'In\' and \'Out/Thru\' ports built into the casing. Right from the start, it was production-ready."', 'In the same year, the Commodore Amiga computer was released, and it was also a wildly popular tool among electronic musicians. When paired with the OctaMED software, the Amiga became a powerful instrument for creating tracks, showing up on many jungle classics, including DJ Zinc\'s 1996 "Super Sharp Shooter," an underground smash that featured brilliantly chopped samples of Fred Wesley & The J.B.\'s "Blow Your Head" and Method Man\'s "Release Yo\' Delf" over a barrage of "Amen" and "Sweet Pea" breaks.', "As the '90s gave way to the 2000s, drum and bass has continued to splinter, evolve, and mutate. Contemporary genres and subgenres like grime, breakcore, neurofunk, liquid, and beyond all carry pieces of jungle/drum and bass' DNA with them today.", 'As music sampling techniques and the music-making technology that facilitates those techniques have advanced, many of the old tools used to create those early classics have fallen out of favor, for the most part. Atari home computers and rackmount S950 samplers have been replaced by high-powered laptops and comprehensive DAWs, stocked with software samplers, virtual mixing desks and powerful soft-synths.', 'Despite this, the sense of experimentation and adventure that made jungle so special continues on. Producers and DJs continue to make magic out of a wide variety of source materials. Nearly three decades removed from jungle\'s initial explosion, samples are still being flipped and "Amen" breaks are still being chopped.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

That’s broadly true—jazz has always been a live, in-the-moment art form—but how the music is captured can be as important as how it’s played. Nobody knew that better than engineer Rudy Van Gelder, whose productions for Blue Note Records in the 1950s and 1960s permanently shaped the label’s image and reputation.', 'Born in Jersey City, NJ in 1924, Van Gelder began as an amateur, working as an optometrist by day and making records by night in his parents’ Hackensack home. The musicians would set up in the living room, with a control room adjacent. By 1959, though, he’d moved to a purpose-built studio in nearby Englewood Cliffs.', 'Van Gelder Studios soon became crucial to the development of mainstream jazz in the 1960s. Savoy, Riverside, and other labels all employed Van Gelder, but it was Blue Note that became most closely identified with his particular sound. And that particular sound was truly unique.', 'Engineers for Columbia and RCA, and even small labels like Contemporary, strove to preserve the music they recorded as precisely as possible, and they succeeded. An album like Sonny Rollins’ Way Out West, recorded by engineer Ray DuNann in Los Angeles, has an extremely crisp, clear, and balanced sound, totally free of distortion.', 'On the flip side, a Van Gelder recording has a rough-edged wildness that’s more comparable to a Sun or Motown release. It also has some instantly recognizable sonic fingerprints. The horns and the drums are big and brash, coming right at you. The piano, on the other hand, is frequently muffled and subdued—even rinkydink at times—and unless the bassist is soloing, he’s buried, too.', 'Legendary producer Don Was—who has worked with Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones, Iggy Pop, The B-52s, and too many other artists to list here—has been the president of Blue Note Records since 2012. He can still recall the first time he heard a Rudy Van Gelder recording. It was 1966, he was 14 years old and sitting in his mother’s car listening to Joe Henderson’s Mode For Joe on Detroit radio station WCHB.', "“I felt like I was having a conversation with Joe Henderson over the AM radio, you know?” Was says. “And I believe that’s a testimony to Rudy’s mic'ing technique. In fact, I [recently] had [Herbie Hancock’s] Maiden Voyage playing on my iPhone, which is essentially like listening to a transistor radio, and it sounded like Freddie Hubbard was standing by the sink playing. So there was something he was doing. I met him twice, and I knew better than to ask for mic'ing secrets, but I’ve read some accounts and… best I can visualize is that he maybe mic'd a little too close for the accepted techniques of the time, and in doing so he had a higher threshold of distortion, that I think translates to immediacy. I think distortion’s a good thing.”", 'Nick O’Toole, one of the co-owners of the independent jazz label Posi-Tone (which is celebrating its 25th anniversary in 2020), produces all of their releases himself and acknowledges Van Gelder as a pioneer. “I think Rudy’s style stands the test of time,” he says.', "“It may have been different back then, but you listen to it now and at least for me, the tones he gets on the horns are magical, you know? And he did what he could with the drums and the bass, because it was a different type of separation. Nowadays, everyone’s comfortable on headphones, and it’s a whole different way of recording now than back in the day, when you put everybody in the same room and maybe some stuff in between, some gobos. So I think he was limited in that way, but the fact that he was doing it every day in his own studio, the consistency of the sound… that’s the beauty of some of those '50s and '60s records. Maybe the horn’s screaming, but it’s beautiful.”", 'On certain Blue Note recordings, the use of distortion can go so far beyond convention that it almost becomes noise. Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers’ 1964 album Free For All is a prime example. Freddie Hubbard’s trumpet, Curtis Fuller’s trombone, and Wayne Shorter’s tenor saxophone all leap out of the speakers, with just a slight crackle. But Blakey’s drums are like a series of explosions, nearly blowing out the microphones and thoroughly drowning out Cedar Walton’s piano and Reggie Workman’s bass.', 'Blakey’s bands did this frequently; the 1961 album A Night in Tunisia, recorded by an earlier Jazz Messengers lineup, is almost as unhinged—the title track in particular. And yet, these albums are some of the most visceral and exciting jazz you’ll ever hear in your life.', '“I’m an engineer, not a producer,” Van Gelder told a New York Times reporter in 2005. “I’m the person who makes the recording process work. I built the studio, I created the environment in which they play, I selected, installed and operated the equipment.” What exactly that equipment consisted of, and how it was operated, was information Van Gelder kept to himself.', 'We do know that a lot of his equipment was home-built, but some of it was new technology. He was one of the first US engineers, for example, to have and use Neumann microphones. But he would frequently take precision equipment and disguise it—placing Schoeps microphones in Shure housings, for example—to keep peers off his trail.', 'Blue Note co-founder Francis Wolff’s lush black-and-white photos, taken during the sessions and incorporated into graphic designer Reid Miles’ iconic album covers, were another crucial element to the label’s overall presentation. Van Gelder would often move microphones out of the way before Wolff shot, so that nobody would know what he was using or how it had been positioned.', 'Not everyone was a fan of Van Gelder’s approach, of course, then or now. In a 1959 Down Beat blindfold test, legendary bassist/composer Charles Mingus said, “He tries to change people’s tones. I’ve seen him do it… I’ve seen him take [trumpeter] Thad Jones and the way he sets him up at the mic, he can change the whole sound. That’s why I never go to him; he ruined my bass sound."', 'Fans of ultra-pristine sound—the kind of guys who can spend an afternoon ranking matrix numbers on Steely Dan LPs—have been known to gripe about Van Gelder’s work. Mastering engineer Steve Hoffman infamously wrote on his own website, “Take three or four expensive German mics with a blistering top-end boost, put them real close to the instruments, add some extra distortion from a cheap overloading mic preamp through an Army Surplus radio console, put some crappy plate reverb on it, and record. Then, immediately (and for no good reason), redub the master onto a Magnatone tape deck at +6, compress the crap out of it while adding 5 dB at 5000 cycles to everything. That’s the Van Gelder sound to me.”', 'To Don Was, Van Gelder’s relative isolation in Hackensack, New Jersey was what allowed him to experiment, and develop his trademark sound. Was says that he went through a similar process himself, in Detroit. “There was no one to teach me engineering, but there were studios that were willing to let me go in at midnight and experiment for a couple of years. And that was the only way I was able to do it, was through trial and error. And you come up with something that’s different than you would have come up with if you were a second engineer at Columbia Studios in New York or something like that, where they taught you the ‘proper’ way and put you in a lab coat and that kind of thing.”', 'He compares the classic Blue Note sound to that of Sun, Chess, Motown, or Stax recordings—all unique, all instantly recognizable, “so there’s a lot to be said for doing it on your own in a remote, provincial setting, in terms of coming up with personality. And I think Rudy did that—even though he was close to New York City, he might as well have been a thousand miles away, because he was a ham radio operator who built his own gear. That’s the other thing, too, the stuff that’s not necessarily willful, just the signal path he had. That’s as distinctive as a guitar. Every Fender Precision bass sounds different, and every signal chain sounds different, and is gonna have a character.”', 'The final component of Van Gelder’s sound was the mastering, which was red-hot in order to blare out of the primary music delivery systems of the time: mono jukebox speakers, transistor radios, and car radios.', 'Was, who visited Van Gelder in his studio, says, “He explained [to me] that his lathe was such an important part of that sound—he had a Scully lathe, and he was buddies with Mr. Scully and they hot-rodded his lathe, basically. I don’t know how to separate that from the sound. I do know this, that if you put up the master tapes, they don’t sound like the records we know. You have to do something to them, you can’t just put them up.”', 'Like Was, O’Toole believes the mix of rawness and polish in Van Gelder’s classic sound draws the listener in. “You may not hear every bass note, you may lose the accents and the touch on the drums a little bit, but nowadays with the limiting and the compression, it’s too much to handle sometimes. Your brain just can’t process that much information. And not to get into vinyl versus CD, but that’s why some people like vinyl—there’s not as much information there, and it’s within the human hearing range, and that’s why people say it’s ‘warm.’ You probably don’t have 17KHz on a record, and you don’t have 50 Hz on a record either.”', 'It’s in that hazy zone between “warm” and “hot” that Rudy Van Gelder made his magic. And even if some of what he did was “wrong” from a technical standpoint, well, it made the recordings sound oh so right.', "Los Angeles' Techno Empire actually has a cache of Van Gelder's later-year gear for sale on Reverb.

Sign up for free to join the world's best marketplace for music gear. Buy, sell, and discover more about your favorite instruments.", 'In the \'60s, there was a surge in popularity in the West for Indian music, and especially the sitar. George Harrison was the first on a pop record with the big Indian instrument, heard on "Norwegian Wood" on Rubber Soul at the end of 1965, and Brian Jones snuck his into the "Paint It, Black" and "Mother\'s Little Helper" A-sides released a few months later.', 'Using the sitar became a trend, although George wasn\'t impressed by what he\'d started. "What I dislike about the sitar is the way it\'s become the \'in thing.\' I never wanted this," he told Music Maker in 1966. "It\'s just become a part of the bandwagon, with too many people having a go with it, just to be considered \'in.\'"', 'What was needed was an easier way for mere pop mortals to get the sound of the sitar, an instrument that serious Indian masters such as Ravi Shankar spent a lifetime attempting to master.', "Step up one Vincent Gambella, better known as New York session man Vinnie Bell. He'd worked with Nat Daniel, who'd set up Danelectro in New Jersey in the '40s. In the early '60s, Vinnie had helped Nat design the Bellzouki, Dano's electric 12-string, and now the two of them worked on an electric sitar.", 'The key to their invention was a new type of bridge, intended to provide a sitar-like sound from an otherwise relatively normal electric guitar. The almost-flat plastic bridge did create a buzzy sound for their instrument but also made it notoriously difficult to intonate.', 'In Vinnie and Nat\'s patent, filed in 1967, they said a real sitar "produces somewhat of a buzzing sound as the melody is played" and that "the buzz results from the use of a relatively wide bridge against which the strings slap during the playing of the instrument, [which is] far different from the function of conventional [guitar] bridges." They claimed their new bridge design was "sturdy, highly accurate, and most importantly, is easily adjustable."', 'The Coral Sitar was launched in 1967, listing at $295. MCA had bought Danelectro the previous year, and it introduced a new Danelectro-made brand, Coral, named after one of its record labels. The Coral Sitar was a relatively successful attempt to provide a sitar-like sound from an instrument that offered the simpler playability of a regular electric guitar. The other feature that set the Coral apart was the 13 drone strings on the upper body, designed to resonate sympathetically with the regular strings—although, in practice, this proved largely theoretical.', "A Danelectro-brand electric sitar followed, forsaking the ornate shape of the Coral's body and opting instead for something a little closer to the teardrop style of a real sitar, which traditionally used a gourd for its body. The Danelectro model also came with a metal leg-rest screwed to the lower edge of the body to assist any electric sitar players who favored the seated position when exploring their extended afternoon ragas.", "Original production of the Coral and Danelectro sitars barely survived the '60s, but there have been subsequent revivals and copies, mostly based on the Coral style. The best-known for some time were the Jerry Jones models—including versions of both Coral and Dano, as well as the Supreme that provided the drone strings with a short separate neck—but the company stopped production in 2011.", "There have been bits and pieces to assist the keen sitarist, too, including Eyb's replacement bridge and Göldo's Sitarizer Tele replacement saddles. One stylish electric sitar still available is the Modena, introduced by Trev Wilkinson's Italia brand around ten years ago. As well as Italia, Trev is known for his roller nut and vibrato systems, and as the brains behind brands such as Fret-King and Vintage. The Italia Modena Sitar uses the Coral design, as Trev acknowledges.", '"My friend H.B. Cho at Mirr Music in Korea asked me to create a brand for him, which is how I started Italia, probably 20 years ago now," Trev recalls. "The first models for Italia were based around Nationals, Supros, Crucianellis, Davolis, Ekos—you name it. Anyway, another friend, Toshi Owha, had started to make a copy of the Coral Sitar with the Star brandname, which H.B. was making for him. I\'d already done the Modena guitar with Italia, and I said to H.B. wouldn\'t it be cool if we put the drone strings of a Coral on the top bout of the Modena, to change it into a sitar? That\'s about as much design as I put into it, to be honest! That was all it needed."', 'Trev used Gotoh\'s sitar bridge on the Modena, a refined version of the original. He explains that the Gotoh has a double radius, where the original Coral was radiused in one direction. "You could rock the Coral bridge back and forth to adjust for the sitar effect, and you could lift it from side to side to try and get the right zizzle from the strings. But it was only radiused along the horizontal. That\'s where Gotoh, in their usual way, got hold of it and said OK, we\'ll improve this. They gave it some grooves for the strings to run through, which follow the radius of what a fingerboard would be, or close to it, and then it\'s radiused the other way, which allows the strings to just touch the surface plane and create the—well, to create the bad saddle effect," he concludes with a laugh.', 'Probably the most impressive application of an original Coral Sitar\'s bad saddle effect came with Steely Dan\'s "Do It Again," a hit single in 1972 and a highlight of the band\'s debut album, Can\'t Buy A Thrill. The star of the cut is Denny Dias and his dazzling electric sitar solo. Denny tells me he doesn\'t recall much about that session from nearly 50 years ago. "I only saw the Coral for a few hours," he says, "on the day we recorded that solo."', 'Someone with a clearer memory is the British musician, arranger, and producer Pip Williams. Today, he\'s a senior lecturer in music technology at the University of West London, and he perseveres with his passion for orchestral and choral arranging with the Finnish group Nightwish, which Pip describes as "arguably the world\'s number one symphonic metal band."', 'Back in 1972, however, Pip was at the Village Recorder studio in Los Angeles, working as the orchestral arranger for Bloodstone\'s Natural High album, produced by Mike Vernon. "In those days I was primarily a soul arranger," he tells me, "and I was aware of things like The Delfonics \'Didn\'t I (Blow Your Mind This Time)\' along with a hell of a lot of other soul records that featured the electric sitar. I thought, well, I must have a look for one when I get to Los Angeles."', 'A chance visit to a pawn shop across the street from the studio landed Pip a Coral Sitar for $50, complete with rusty strings, a good deal of grime, and a parting word from the guy behind the counter: "It\'s a horrible thing—you\'ll probably never use it."', 'Back in the Village Recorder, Pip tried out his new purchase, and the tape op nipped into the room next door to chat with Steely Dan, mentioning the sitar. Pip recalls: "Someone from Steely Dan came in and said, \'I understand you\'ve got hold of one of these Coral electric sitars. Can we rent it off you?\' I said you don\'t need to rent it, you can borrow it, mate. The strings are all rusty, and it looks completely fucked—but you\'re welcome to take it and try it. Anyway, off he goes, and then he came back with it a short while later. And apparently they\'d done the solo on \'Do It Again.\'"', 'Denny Dias says Steely Dan\'s original intention for the Coral Sitar didn\'t work out. "We wanted to put a drone on \'Do It Again\' like a sitar—but the thing would not drone," he remembers. "The drone was going to be like that Beatles tune that starts with a sitar. But then I started playing some licks, and someone said let\'s do the solo with that thing. I\'ve never seen or played one since."', 'Meanwhile, Pip took his bargain Coral back home, playing it on many sessions in Britain and in the States. One of the most commercial featured a rare use of the sitar\'s drone strings, which he strummed to produce the ringing gliss that pops up through Tina Charles\'s "I Love To Love," a UK number 1 single in 1976.', "Much later, after an unwelcome visit from the taxman, Pip had to sell his Coral—by then, one of his less used instruments. So if you stumble on Coral Sitar serial 820015, you'll have found an instrument with some sparkling history behind it.", "New to Reverb?

George suggests Mike should charge £30 for an afternoon’s work creating synth sounds for the world’s most famous group.', 'Mike’s professional path as a musician had taken a strong turn six years earlier in Manfred Mann, where he mainly played guitar—although he was also proficient on saxophone and flute. Despite the hits, he left late in 1965 after a movie producer heard his solo single, “On The Brink,” and offered him a tempting opportunity to compose a film score. That was exactly the sort of thing he wanted to get into.', '“Maybe I could have done it without leaving the group,” Mike tells me, “but we were working all the time, and I just got very excited about doing a score—and they offered me another one soon afterwards. I never doubted that I’d done the right thing. And a year or so after I’d left, I started getting incredibly busy with arrangements, too.”', 'He became a first-call arranger for British pop records, working regularly alongside producers and A&R men with artists such as Cilla Black, Cliff Richard, and Engelbert Humperdinck. In 1967, he arranged and conducted the orchestra for The Beatles’ performance of “All You Need Is Love” as part of the "Our World" global satellite broadcast.', 'As he worked around the London studios, he heard about “some mad professor called Moog and something called a synthesizer.” Mike already had ideas about using electronic sounds in pop music. He’d built himself an oscillator from a Heathkit and played it experimentally on his 1967 solo single “Captain Scarlet And The Mysterons,” and a little later on a Paul Jones album track, “The Committee.” So, a Moog voltage-controlled synthesizer must have seemed like the next logical step. A big, brave, expensive step.', 'In 1968, the year that Wendy Carlos’s hit album Switched On Bach brought Robert Moog’s creations to popular attention, Mike ordered a Moog IIIc. He borrowed a staggering sum (his recollection is £3,500, around $8,300 USD at the time) to buy the modular synthesizer. As he waited many weeks for his prize to arrive, he kept himself busy reading and re-reading the three paltry pages of Moog information he’d been given.', '“There was a paragraph on each of the various modules—just very little information. But I read this every night in bed, trying to learn what the functions were and everything. And I was startled—What!—when I read that it was monophonic, that you could only play one note at a time. But eventually I understood why that was. I couldn’t wait for it to turn up, actually.”', 'Eventually the packages arrived. His IIIc came in several parts. “There was a keyboard, the Ribbon Controller slider thing, and two wooden cabinets. The main bottom cabinet sloped backwards slightly—you put the keyboard and ribbon in front of it—and then the second cabinet sat on top of the first one.”', 'The IIIc came as standard with at least a VCO, white sound source, fixed filter bank, VCF low-pass, VCF high-pass, filter coupler, reverberation unit, envelope follower, and a four-channel mixer—plus nine oscillators, three oscillator controllers, three VCAs, three envelope generators, and several console panels, along with a large pile of patch cords and switch-trigger cords.', '“Later,” Mike says, “I got a double sequencer unit, which sat on the top of it all and made it quite a tall thing in the end. Anyway, when it first arrived I set it all up, and the first snag was that it was made for American power. So someone had to find me a transformer. Then I plugged it in and started mucking about with it—and that’s basically what I did forever after,” he adds with a laugh. “Muck about with it! It’s such a learning experience. Once I got my brain around it, it was amazing really.”', 'He was in select company. Manchester University may have been the first to own a Moog modular system in the UK. Theirs was shipped in August 1968, just before The Rolling Stones’ order left the Moog factory in Trumansburg, New York. George Harrison’s IIIp was shipped in January 1969, and George almost immediately recorded his Electronic Sounds album with it, assisted by Paul Beaver and Bernie Krause. These two musicians had first alerted American rock players to the possibilities of the Moog when they demonstrated one at the Monterey festival in 1967.', 'Mike Vickers became the main man on the London studio scene who could work and play a Moog, and he developed a useful sideline to his other professional activities by hiring the synth or, more often, himself and the synth. Later, he helped Keith Emerson enter the world of voltage-controlled synthesis, and he used his IIIc for TV and movie work and many solo projects, including library-music recordings such as his KPM albums A Moog For All Reasons (1972) and A Moog For More Reasons (1975).', 'But it was George Harrison’s IIIp that The Beatles had at Abbey Road in August 1969 when Mike arrived. “They were playing ‘Because’ as I walked into the control room,” he recalls, “and it just sounded so utterly beautiful. I couldn’t believe it. They were so calm and relaxed, adding a couple more harmonies down in the studio. Golly! I thought the way they worked was amazing. Nobody seemed to say anything, but it all happened. Extraordinary.”', 'They moved to a small room off of Studio 3 where the Moog was set up. “They told me vaguely what they might want—something tinkly, something like horns, big brass, whatever, and then I’d set it up. Paul played the keyboard, John played the keyboard, George played the keyboard—so I’d set the sounds up and then they’d play their part. They all seemed to know exactly what they wanted to do on the keyboard, so it all went very quickly. It was all done in about three hours.”', 'Mike helped them get the sounds they wanted to add to four songs. For “Because,” he conjured up some brassy sounds and a wobbly melody, and “Maxwell’s Silver Hammer” benefitted from more brassy parts plus some tremulous high stuff and glissy bits. When it came to “I Want You (She’s So Heavy),” Mike showed them how to produce noise from the Moog’s fixed filter bank, and for “Here Comes The Sun” he helped them with the gliss-down at the front and yet more brassy sounds in the “sun sun sun” chorus.', '“It’s hard to remember exactly what I did more than 50 years ago,” Mike says with a smile. “But the brassy stuff would tend to be several oscillators set to sawtooth, through a filter with envelope control for the brassy attack. The high melodic stuff would tend to be a triangular wave, or perhaps a heavily filtered sawtooth, with applied wobbles with vibrato or tremolo from an LFO, maybe.”', 'For “I Want You” and the noise from the synth’s fixed filter bank, Mike recalls feeding in white noise at one end. “Then it had about 16 or more frequency bands, each of which you could turn up however much you wanted, on its own or in combination with others. George Harrison was doing that. I set it up, but he started turning them up and built this increasing white noise all over the place.', '"Rather than play the keyboard, he fiddled about with the filter—he was good at that. It gets a bit unclear and chaotic as it goes on, but that’s how it was done. I used to have a chart which I made and copied many times, on which I marked the patch cords and knob settings for each piece. Life before memory was very tough!”', 'A few days after Abbey Road was released in 1969, Mike appeared on a BBC TV popular science show, "Tomorrow’s World," with his IIIc and a four-track tape machine. The clip opened with him playing over his multi-tracked rendition of “Greensleeves.” The voiceover told viewers that all the electronic sounds they heard were made by this one man, Michael Vickers, on a single musical instrument.', '“It’s called the Moog synthesizer. It produces sounds in a matter of minutes which would normally take radiophonic experts with their complicated equipment days of work and multiple re-recordings to achieve.” In the few minutes available, the piece did a reasonable job of explaining the basics of the new-fangled device.', '“To be honest with you, it was very boring to me how they wanted to do it,” Mike recalls of the TV experience. “I was still full of Switched On Bach, but today the idea of using a brand-new instrument to do old music, like ‘Greensleeves’—well, it seems silly to me now. I could have done something spacey and noisy, which was much more what I was interested in.', '"Once I had my Moog, I just learned to pile things in and try things out. Rather than trying to sort of pre-determine the sound in my head, I’d very often just see what happened. That suited me much better. I guess I was in some sort of a Moog haze, starry-eyed and voltage-controlled.”', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

By the end of the decade, rap music would be leaning toward a more minimal, stripped-down sound, a sound that did not require samples, or at least did not rely on them to such a great extent.", "It would take a few years for manufacturers to come up with an instrument that would both suit the needs of hip-hop producers and define rap music's new sound. In 1999, pioneering Japanese electronic instrument makers Korg released the Triton, a workstation/synthesizer that was a wholesale upgrade of Korg's Trinity workstation that had been released in 1995.", "Coming out of the box with sequencing and sampling capabilities as well as Korg's powerful HI (Hyper Integrated) sample-based PCM synthesis engine, the Triton—along with its many model variants the LE, Studio, Extreme, Pro, and Pro X—provided an all-in-one solution for producers who wanted to build tracks with a single machine, from the ground up.", "The Triton's specs are impressive for its time. With 256 drum samples in 64 user drum kits and 375 PCM multi-sample sounds recorded at a 48kHz sampling rate, the Triton's sound was clear, punchy, and colorful. Sporting a large touch screen on its face, the Triton allowed users to scroll through a seemingly endless array of options divided into categories like woodwinds, brass, piano/keys, strings, and other instrument groups. The 16-track MIDI sequencer could be used to record and playback up to 200 songs, with one song able to use as many as 100 patterns.", 'With such onboard capabilities—and thanks to EXB-PCM expansion boards, the ability to add even more—the Triton either rivaled or surpassed any workstation that was on the market at the time.', 'In the hands of a generation of young producers, the Triton was a powerful workhorse whose sound would show up on an untold number of hit rap songs, while also making its mark on pop and R&B. Before DAW-equipped laptops became powerful enough to surpass keyboard workstations, it was the Triton that producers carried from studio to studio, showing off their latest beats and taking them to the next stage of production.', 'In a now-famous clip from Jay-Z\'s 2004 documentary, Fade to Black, the Brooklyn-born rapper visits beatsmith and music production savant Timbaland in the studio.

After Jay passes on the quirky, bass-heavy beats that would later become Ludacris\' thunderous club banger "The Potion" and Brandy\'s Middle Eastern–tinged, R&B banger "Come As You Are," Tim plays the opening of a rowdy, synth-heavy beat that forces Jay to jump up out of his chair.', '"Dirt Off Your Shoulder" and the scene is notable because it shows Tim cueing up the beats from a rig that includes a Korg Triton Pro, likely connected via MIDI to his trusty Ensoniq ASR-10. As Timbaland and his Triton would dominate the aughts, racking up production credits for Aaliyah, Missy Elliot, Madonna, and more, another production team from his home state of Virginia would rise to challenge his chart dominance—and push the creative possibilities of the Triton.', "As The Neptunes, producer/songwriters Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo spent the entire decade of the 2000s at the top of the charts, with many of their most memorable hits crafted using stock sounds from the Korg Triton. Utilizing the Triton's colorful sonic palette, Chad and Pharrell took their experience as high-school band geeks (turned apprentices for Teddy Riley) and applied it to their catchy fusion of heavy hip-hop beats and sweet, synthesized instrumentation.", 'From Clipse\'s minimal, lunch table classic "Grindin\'" (utilizing the Triton\'s B116:Percussion Kit) to the understated plucked guitar of Jay-Z\'s "I Just Wanna Love You" and Justin Timberlake\'s funky radio smash "Rock Your Body," The Neptunes and their Korg Triton scored the soundtrack to club nights, block parties, and radio mixes throughout the decade.', 'The Triton\'s dominance of the 2000s did not end with The Neptunes and Timbaland. The powerful and versatile instrument was used on massive hits from Lil Jon, Scott Storch, and Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins, and the Triton also found its way into the home studios of an untold number of aspiring music producers.', 'Producer/multi-instrumentalist Pat Van Dyke started his production career while attending college at William Paterson University in New Jersey. In those early days, the Korg Triton was an essential part of his setup.', '"Before the days of affordable interfaces and DAWs, the Triton was the machine every young producer wanted; an all-in-one workstation, sequencer, synthesizer, and sampler that had everyone thinking they were Rodney Jerkins in the privacy of their dorm rooms," he says. "The ability to load and chop samples, plug a microphone directly into the back, sequence individual sections as well as entire arrangements, a full keyboard, and the ability to mix internally made the Triton the go-to machine of the era."', "Two decades after the Triton's release, hip-hop producers have largely replaced it and other all-in-one hardware workstations with digital audio workstations, whether Ableton Live, Reason, Logic, FL Studio, or others. Despite this, the hip-hop, R&B, and pop hits produced on the machine remain popular, their bright, bass-heavy sound sparking deep feelings of nostalgia in the generation that grew up on them.", "In 2019, in celebration of the 20th anniversary of Triton's release, Korg released the first VST emulation of the classic workstation, letting today's producers bring the workstation's PCM sounds and its particular coloration into their DAWs.", "According to Korg's website, the process of creating the Triton VST was supervised by members of the original development team. Since its release, the VST has received near-universal acclaim with music production YouTubers like Weaver Beats and Ave Mcree, who praise the software for its accuracy at replicating the sound of the hardware original.", "The fact that the hits that the Korg Triton helped produce are still playing all around the world, and that a new generation of producers are able to capture that sound with Korg's software recreation, are testaments to the quality and enduring influence of this beloved machine.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

In the label\'s early years, Island was a vehicle to deliver ska and rocksteady records to English listeners, scoring early hits with songs like Millie Small\'s "My Boy Lollipop" and eventually making an international star out of Bob Marley in the 1970s.', "By the late '70s, Island had grown into a small empire. Still independent, Island had built an impressive, now-legendary pool of talent that included the likes of King Crimson, Spencer Davis Group, Free, Nick Drake, Roxy Music, and Cat Stevens, in addition to reggae artists such as Marley, Toots and the Maytals, and Junior Murvin. Blackwell had also opened two London studios—including Basing Street Studios, a converted church—but as he neared the end of his second decade at Island's helm, he sought to do the opposite of his first mission: He wanted to bring music back to the Caribbean.", 'In 1977, he saw that vision come to fruition with the construction of Compass Point Studios in Nassau, The Bahamas—christened, Lee "Scratch" Perry once apocryphally observed, with the blood of a freshly killed chicken spat from Blackwell\'s own mouth (a Jamaican custom, as Blackwell supposedly explained). The studio itself offered no sight so horrific. One part state-of-the-art studio to one part tropical getaway, relaxation and comfort was a built-in feature of the studio\'s environment. Outside of the intensity of a city environment, it allowed artists to escape everyday stresses and chaos while they were recording. Later on, Blackwell even opened up an adjacent property as a proper resort, reinforcing the idea of Compass Point as a getaway.', '"The idea was, get all of these folks together, put them in a very relaxed tropical setting, with a brand-new, state-of-the-art studio but with nothing else around it," says journalist David Katz in an interview with Public Radio International\'s The World. "In some ways it\'s the polar opposite of what one encounters in Kingston, Jamaica. … As soon as you step out of the studio, it\'s total chaos. You know, endless distractions and quite a volatile atmosphere. Well Compass Point was exactly the opposite. You step outside the studio, there\'s nothing but tranquillity."', 'Technologically, Compass Point\'s setup adhered to the state-of-the-art studio standards of the late \'70s and early \'80s, outfitted with an MCI 2-inch 24-track tape machine and mixing desk—the preferred console for producers like Brian Eno who had made use of the facilities. Yet aside from its equipment, according to a 2008 article in The Independent, there was "nothing remarkable about the studio itself. What gave it something special was the paradise-like setting, its \'restful\' location and the relaxed atmosphere."', 'Blackwell himself had a relaxed approach to production when he brought artists into the studio. As The B-52s\' Kate Pierson observes in the documentary, Keep On Running: 50 Years of Island Records, during the recording of the Athens, Georgia band\'s debut album, Blackwell put his feet up on the mixing desk, "lit up a fat one," and let the band do its work.', 'Much like Muscle Shoals had its Rhythm Section and Stax had Booker T & the M.G.\'s, Compass Point had its own house band of ringers that brought their own unique blend of funk and staccato reggae rhythm to its recordings: The Compass Point All Stars. Anchored by drummer Sly Dunbar and bassist Robbie Shakespeare, whose credits can be found on hundreds of records, the All Stars also included at various points French keyboardist Wally Badarou, guitarists Barry Reynolds and Mikey Chung, percussionist Uziah "Sticky" Thompson, and later Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz of Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club.', "An early microcosm of these combined elements, and the All Stars' chemistry in particular, came during the recording of two iconic Grace Jones albums, 1980's Warm Leatherette and 1981's Nightclubbing, which were birthed from the same sessions. Simultaneously inspired by Black Uhuru and David Bowie alike, the musicians found their muse in a glamorous, deeply funky approach to reggae and pop. It took some time to fully get situated; at first, Badarou—having arrived at the studio facilities weeks earlier than the rest of the band—wasn't entirely impressed with the material at first listen.", "It didn't take long for the musicians to get locked into the music. They put an oversized picture of Jones up on the studio wall to have her be present even when she wasn't in the room, as a kind of paper muse. Once they got going they moved swiftly and without any need for belaboring each detail. If they didn't nail a song by the third take, they'd simply move on. But they also came prepared—armed with both chops and ideas.", '"We loved dance music, we\'d listen to everything, because we were always working and wanting the reggae we did to move a bit forward, so anything that we could drag to it, we would bring that—as ideas, or as musicians coming to play with us," Dunbar said in an interview with FACT Magazine.', 'The chemistry and prowess of the Compass Point All-Stars, combined with the interaction of artists outside the islands, is what resulted in the kind of lightning-in-a-bottle magic that made it onto the records made there.', '"Assemble a core of session players that could rival the all-time great session players of studios like Stax or Motown, and get them together and let them jam and see what came out of it," Katz said. "And then bring down other artists that had no connection to the Caribbean, and have them interact with these musicians."', "In addition to the raw talent attached to Compass Point, its in-house engineer Alex Sadkin earned a reputation for his meticulous techniques. He would spend as long as four solid hours setting up Sly Dunbar's drums in order to capture every frequency.", "Compass Point's earned reputation as a kind of Muscle Shoals of the Caribbean led to it becoming one of the most in-demand studios of the 1980s. In addition to being the place where Grace Jones' iconic albums were captured on tape, it served as the venue for AC/DC's Back In Black, Talking Heads' Remain in Light, Iron Maiden's Piece of Mind, Black Uhuru's Red, and Gregory Isaacs' Night Nurse.", 'Eventually, demand had risen so high that the overbooked studio had necessitated construction of a Studio B in order to house the number of projects slated for recording.', "Sadkin died in a motorcycle accident in 1987, sadly, and that same year Blackwell grew increasingly distracted by Island Records' financial follies, including its ill-fated attempt at expanding into film, Island Pictures. The label's cashflow problems led to its inability to pay royalties it owed to U2 in the sum of $5 million due to the success of The Joshua Tree (which, it should be noted, were eventually paid back with interest). By 1989 he eventually sold Island Records to Polygram for the equivalent of $300 million. As this was happening, cocaine trafficking had risen throughout the Caribbean, and New Providence—the island where Compass Point was located—became a major hub. The rise in crime in the area ultimately made it a less desirable destination.", 'Blackwell was able to keep Compass Point open and running for another two decades, however, thanks to his hiring of Terry and Sherrie Manning, who had previously worked at Stax Records and Ardent Studios, as well as EMI\'s Abbey Road. And for a time, Compass Point enjoyed a second, prolific wave, becoming the venue for a new series of recordings by the likes of Björk, Lenny Kravitz, and Shakira. However, by the late \'00s, it once again ran into problems with personal safety and "an atmosphere that we knew to be threatening," as a post on the studio\'s official website read. The idyllic atmosphere Blackwell sought to create with his studio escape essentially nullified, in 2010, Compass Point closed permanently.', "Compass Point may have eventually reached its end after 30 years, but where only a shuttered structure remains, a legacy in innovation and musical freedom lives on. It's in the polyrhythmic grooves of Talking Heads' Remain in Light, in the global funk of Lizzy Mercier Descloux's Funky Nassau, and in the genre-bending riddims of Grace Jones' Nightclubbing.", '"There was a plan for all those albums we recorded there [in Compass Point]," Dunbar told FACT.

Hardcore punk was, to its benefit, politically minded. But it was also a mostly straight, male-dominated, cisgendered, and macho successor to the more open-ended punk of the '70s. In the same way that women would create riot grrrl as a counterpoint to hardcore punk's masculine anger, queer punks had to form their own genre to be heard.", "First called homocore and shortly thereafter queercore, the subgenre grew throughout the '80s and '90s as more and more fans and artists made a musical home within it. Arriving as it did in the pre-internet era, queercore spread like a slow-moving forest fire, with far-flung embers igniting smaller fires in distant cities, rarely if ever meeting at once. (Because of that slow growth, the subgenre was not really discussed in mainstream music outlets until after riot grrrl broke, though queercore predates and influenced it.)", 'The central dilemma of liking punk music but feeling shut out from its community was largely the same, whether in 1985 Toronto or 1990 San Francisco. Across time and place, there are similar stories.', "Tom Jennings, co-creator of the Homocore zine, which launched in 1988 in San Francisco, compiled a list of queer-friendly songs to accompany each issue. But he had trouble coming up with enough music that wasn't homophobic. Sometimes, in an act of subversion, he'd include those bands in his mixtapes anyway.", '"We were grasping for stuff that was musically compatible," he says in Queercore: How to Punk a Revolution. "Like, \'Look, oh, this is a great punk song!\' Oh, you\'re a bunch of dickheads. Ugh, that\'s less interesting now. Unless you\'re really cute, but that lasts for like 15 minutes, right?"', 'Jody Bleyle surveyed a similar problem in 1993, before co-founding Team Dresch in Olympia, Washington: "There weren\'t that many songs about love. I mean, can you imagine thinking that there\'s a problem because there aren\'t enough songs about love that you can relate to? I mean, that\'s crazy."', 'Chicago\'s Martin Sorrondeguy, who was the lead singer for hardcore band Los Crudos before forming the queercore Limp Wrist, told the Chicago Reader in 2019, "If I saw somebody that I could clock as being queer in a hardcore punk space in the \'80s, I was afraid for them."', 'Chris Freeman from Pansy Division (which would become one of the most commercially successful queercore bands) told Billboard in 1995: "When I was 15 and realized I was gay, I really needed to find a band like this. There was absolutely no one to look up to."', "Like their punk predecessors, queercore artists didn't set out to uphold the conventional standards of recording—they just needed to get down the song with the statement intact. With second-hand instruments and self-recorded anthems, all of these artists took the concept of queercore and ran with it. But where did it come from?", 'The band that launched queercore—years before the term would even be used—was more than a band. A collection of multimedia artists, Fifth Column was a feminist, collectivist ensemble that can lay just as much of a claim to launching queercore as they can riot grrrl, from way back in 1980.', 'In Any Night of the Week: A D.I.Y. History of Toronto Music, 1957–2001, soon-to-be-lead-singer Caroline Azar recalls seeing her bandmates for the first time as they performed at a house show under the name Second Unit:', '"I walked in, and I thought, ‘Whoa, this is the first time I’ve seen exciting, gorgeous, young Toronto girls doing their thing.’ I thought their look was impeccable, their attitude was pure, raw, and truthful, and what they played … It was a war of sound."', "That night, they played their only three songs on repeat until their set was over. Rechristened Fifth Column after Azar joined, the group wove post-punk angularity with '60s girl-group pop, soundtrack music, and experimental noise. Their first release, a four-way compilation called The Urban Scorch with March of Values, Diners' Club, and The Party's Over, arrived on a 60-minute cassette from Søme Records.", 'To promote the compilation, Søme Records printed broadsheets and interviews and enticed listeners to spread the music on their own. They sold the "sub-master package," which gave buyers a "real-time copy of the original mastertape" that they were advised to re-copy and sell themselves, so long as they sold copies outside of Toronto: "Order today and make yourself big kapital!!!" The standard release also encouraged proliferation via dubbing, declaring, "copyright: sudden death to all exploitative persons, however we welcome all non-commercial tape copying and broadcast."', 'The recordings themselves were relatively crude. Each band contributed 15 minutes of music, mostly taped from live shows (the only additional info on the liner notes for Fifth Column\'s contributions is: "produced by Jack F. & Fifth Column"). Nonetheless, the tape set the stage for the band\'s next decade of releases and multimedia campaigns.', 'Fifth Column\'s Azar and G.B. Jones had already created the Hide zine. Accompanying its varied Xeroxed salvos and collaged artwork were cassette tapes recorded at their living space and headquarters, featuring their post-punk peers and other assorted experimentalists. Hide\'s fourth issue, published in 1982, included the Urban Renewal compilation, which advised "no noise reduction/normal EQ" on its jacket.', 'Hide Records, as a label, was a natural outgrowth, which they used to self-release their proper debut album in 1986, To Sir With Hate. It was made on a shoestring budget with producer Michael Phillip Wojewoda, who had contributed as a solo artist to Hide tapes and, years later, would have the good fortune of producing several Barenaked Ladies records.', "The Fifth Column template—DIY zines and self-released recordings—was of course not limited to the queercore punk scene, but G.B. Jones' concurrent venture with Bruce LaBruce, a zine called J.D.s launched in 1985, is credited as the first self-aware queercore document—and it had an outsized impact that would be copied in punk communities far and wide.", "LaBruce, then and now an experimental filmmaker, had been performing live with Fifth Column as the group's male go-go dancer. He and G.B. launched J.D.s as an indictment against the scenes they inhabited and as an agitation toward a pro-queer punk scene that didn't yet exist. As Queercore: Queer Punk Media Subculture author and scholar Curran Nault writes:", '', 'Issues of J.D.s often contained lists of "J.D.s Top Ten Homocore Hits," which brought attention to historical punks like The Raincoats as well as burgeoning queercore newbies like Anti-Scrunti Faction (whose Leslie Mah would later co-found Tribe 8).', 'G.B. Jones and LaBruce continued to work hand-in-hand across media: LaBruce sang "The Fairview Mall Story" on Fifth Column\'s debut album. LaBruce\'s short film Boy, Girl— inspired by the lyrics of Fifth Column\'s song of the same name—co-starred Jones. And LaBruce shot the music video for the band\'s "Like This."', "If Jones and LaBruce's first issues of J.D.s were a clarion call for a future scene, it wasn't long before the vision was vindicated. Other artists and zine makers took up the mantle in Chicago, Minneapolis, San Francisco, and other locales.", "The Homocore zine mentioned at the beginning of this article took its name directly from J.D.s' Top Ten lists and included the work of a young Donna Dresch. Dresch's own Chainsaw, launched in Portland, Oregon, followed the Fifth Column/Hide playbook, morphing into a label through compilation tapes.", 'By 1990, the international queercore scene was coalescing. Dresch played on Fifth Column\'s album All-Time Queen of the World and became the inspiration for the group\'s "Donna." Calvin Johnson\'s K Records put out a split single of "Donna" and "All Women Are Bitches" for Fifth Column, which became the group\'s biggest release and plugged them directly into the riot grrrl scene they had inspired from afar.', "New queercore bands formed and rode the wave of independent music overtaking the country, like Tribe 8 and Pansy Division in San Francisco (both of which released through Outpunk, another zine-label), God Is My Co-Pilot in New York City, and a wide assembly of bands via Dresch's Chainsaw Records.", "Some bands on Chainsaw, like Team Dresch, were explicitly queercore, while others are more identified as riot grrrl artists: like Corin Tucker's Heavens to Betsy, Carrie Brownstein's Excuse 17, and their side-project that became their biggest band, Sleater-Kinney.", 'In her memoir, Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl, Brownstein recalls the atmosphere around Dresch: "Team Dresch tore up the stage, allowing their listeners—who included a lot of young queer kids—to act out their audience fantasies in a way they maybe hadn\'t been allowed to do, or felt safe enough to do, at other shows. … Many of us looked up to Team Dresch, Corin and I included. They were a few years older; they had a lot of experience touring, recording, and putting out records."', 'Sleater-Kinney asked Dresch to let them record and release their second album, Call the Doctor. According to Brownstein, the recording sessions were typical of the era: "We set up our amps and drums in the main room with no separation save for baffling. We didn\'t think to adjust sounds or levels between songs or to switch out guitars for a different tone."', "They made the album with John Goodmanson, who had recently recorded Team Dresch's Personal Best, along with records for Bikini Kill and others. Brownstein continues:", '', '', "Created under similar circumstances—in four days in Goodmanson's narrow studio—Team Dresch's Personal Best is a lasting testament to the time, a record that spread across the country through countless small shows and word-of-mouth, as queercore branched outside of its home cities.", 'In 2019, Team Dresch reunited for the 25th anniversary of its release. The intervening years had seen the continued growth of queercore—with queer punk nights and festivals dotting the landscape and an eclectic mix of artists, from Limp Wrist to Lesbians on Ecstasy, continuing to create under the queercore banner. Dresch had an opportunity to see just how far their message had spread.', 'In an interview with NewNowNext about the group\'s reunion tour, she said, "In the ’90s, people didn’t know who we were. Audience members often didn’t know what to make of a bunch of \'queer freaks\' onstage. We’d get a lot of blank stares. … But now, everybody sings along."', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Sampled from a recording of the classic mid-'70s cartoon Fat Albert and The Cosby Kids, it would be hard to imagine this minimal, incidental sound as the potential bedrock for a potent hip-hop tune.", 'The resulting composition, "Verbal Murder 2," finds Common, NORE and Big Pun trading bars over a bouncing, head-nodding beat. That single guitar strum is chopped and pitch-shifted into a four-chord progression; its tremolo effect puts to mind what Italian Soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone would sound like if he tried his hand at boom bap.', "Throughout the documentary, there are ample moments like this: Pete Rock chopping and manipulating impossibly small bits of sound, rearranging and fleshing them out into rich, fully realized hip-hop instrumentals. Twenty-two years later, Soul Survivor remains a landmark production, with each beat crafted on Pete's instrument of choice: the E-Mu SP-1200 sampler and drum machine.", 'Following on the heels of E-Mu\'s SP-12 ("Sampling Percussion 12-bit") from 1985, the SP-1200 found its way onto countless classic hip-hop records and was the go-to instrument of choice for hip-hop producers from the time it was originally released in 1987 until the late \'90s.', 'The list of hip-hop producers who have used the SP-1200 as their primary instrument reads like a who\'s who of Golden Age rap music: in addition to Pete Rock, DJ Premier, J. Dilla, Madlib, Lord Finesse, Large Professor, and his mentor, the late, mythical producer Paul C. In "The Dirty Heartbeat of the Golden Age," a 2007 Village Voice piece on the SP, Public Enemy/Bomb Squad cofounder Hank Shocklee describes the inventive production tricks that \'80s and \'90s hip-hop producers would use to push the technical limitations of the SP-1200 and realize their rich creative visions:', '"There\'s little tricks that were developed on it. For example, you got 12 seconds [10.07, according to the manufacturer] of sample time to divide amongst eight pads. So depending on how much you use on each pad, you decrease the amount of sample time that you have. You take a 33 1/3 record and play it on 45, and you cheat the system. [Another] aspect that we created is out of a mistake—one day I was playing "Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos" and it came out real muffled. I couldn\'t hear any of the high-end part of it. I found out that if you put the phono or quarter-inch jack halfway in, it filters the high frequency [Ed: The sound was an equivalent to a high-pass filter]. Now I just got the bass part of the sample. I was like, \'Oh, shit, this is the craziest thing on the planet!\'"', "The SP-1200 came stock with MIDI in/out/through, 5,000 note memory, and 10 seconds of sampling time at 12-bit resolution, divided into four banks. Combining a sampler and drum machine into one compact, portable unit, the SP-1200 arrived on the market as a more versatile extension of the concept pioneered by machines like Casio's RZ-1 from 1986. With eight outputs in the back, memory dedicated to 100 songs and 100 patterns, and a filter system based on the SSM voltage-controlled filter chip, the SP-1200 is a powerful workhorse and a standout for its time. Often used in combination with Akai's S-950 rackmount sampler, the SP-1200 and its gritty sonic character ruled the '90s until E-Mu discontinued the unit in 1998.", 'In the 2000s, before jazzy, instrumental hip-hop was rebranded as "lo-fi," a small cadre of underground producers like KicDrum Products, Reggie Reg, Loopwhole Beats, Damu the Fudgemunk, and many more, kept their SP-1200s. Sourcing samples from vinyl like their forebears, these producers stayed true to the gritty, beautifully muted sound that the machine was famous for, while a new generation was learning about the machine\'s legacy and dreaming of capturing its signature sound for their own productions.', "In the years since the SP-1200 was discontinued, the interest around it has built up to nearly mythic proportions. Articles were written, YouTube tutorials and testimonials were uploaded, and books were published (like Pbody and KicDrum Products' SP-1200: The Art and the Science). As the machine continued to gain notoriety, demand increased and the price tag attached to the SP grew. While the SP's original retail price was about $2,700, today, an SP-1200 can fetch more than $7,000.", 'In response to this demand, a number of manufacturers have found inspiration from the SP-1200, introducing new products into the market that allow producers to get that classic SP sound without shelling out top-dollar for the original unit.', 'Earlier this year, Low-Hiss Systems released the Beta version of their highly anticipated eSPi app. A number of SP-12 experienced producers like Kenny Dope, DJ Rhettmatic, Lord Finesse, DJ Scratch, and more have worked with early versions of the beta, singing the unit\'s praises. Compatible with Android, iOS, MacOS, Windows and Linux, the stand alone app emulates the warm filters and high-end "ringing" sound of the original SP samplers.', 'For users looking for hardware, E-Mu co-founder Dave Rossum has released a 35th Anniversary SP-1200 reissue—which, like the originals, is itself selling for a premium price— while Isla Instruments S2400 will be available for $949.', 'Talking with Reverb, Veteran DJ producer William "Kencut" Smith sheds some light on the SP-1200\'s enduring appeal:', '"I have an SP-12, SP-1200, an Emulator II and yes, I use my SP-1200 to this day—the best thing that could happen to music. I wouldn\'t trade the SP for the world, and the sound you get out of it is awesome and doesn\'t have that computer sound. Whatever you put in is the exact sound you\'re going to get coming out….that rugged boom bap sound!"', 'Over three decades after it was first introduced to the market, the SP-1200 continues to serve as the backbone for an untold number of hip-hop records. In a musical landscape where "vintage" is king and countless VSTs are rolled out every quarter designed with the intention of capturing that elusive, throwback sound, the SP-1200 remains a standard bearer.

I was sort of living in South America, and I bought it on credit from the Bell’s shop in Surbiton [south London]. I played it right up until I joined Roxy Music.”', 'He was not alone. The connection between Hofner and The Beatles is well known—mostly down to Paul and Stu’s basses and John and George’s guitars in the band’s early days—but thousands of young British guitarists started off with a Hofner. As well as Phil Manzanera, they included Ritchie Blackmore, Peter Frampton, David Gilmour, Peter Green, Mark Knopfler, Albert Lee, Hank Marvin, Mick Taylor, Roy Wood, and many, many more.', 'None of theses lads would have cared much about where their Hofners were made, but in fact they came from Germany. Hofner first produced guitars in the ‘20s, although the Karl Höfner company had been making instruments since its foundation in Schönbach in the 1880s. The firm introduced electrics in 1954, three years after it moved to its new HQ in Bubenreuth.', 'The huge popularity of Hofner guitars in Britain from the mid ‘50s well into the ‘60s was down to a restriction on US imports and the initiative of the Selmer company. It’s these instruments we’ll concentrate on here.', 'Following the end of World War II, Britain controlled American imports to try to improve the nation’s poor financial position. From that time, new American guitars were rarely seen in UK music shops. Broader restrictions announced in 1951 applied mainly to food and manufactured goods, such as records and several categories of instruments, including guitars.', 'The restrictions were eventually lifted during 1959, but in the meantime Selmer in London had been importing Hofner acoustic and electric guitars from Germany. Hofner acoustics first appeared in the UK in 1953 followed by electrics a few years later. Most were made or modified to Selmer’s specifications, and all were given new Brit-friendly model names.', 'Selmer’s first Hofner-made guitars were acoustic archtops, introduced into the British firm’s line in 1953: the non-cutaway Congress (the UK version of the German 449 model) and Senator (455); and the single-cutaway President (457), and Committee (no German version). Selmer added electric versions a few years later of the Senator, President, and Committee.', 'The Committee was aptly named, apparently designed in collaboration with a group of six professional British guitarists: Frank Deniz, Ike Isaacs, Jack Llewellyn, Freddie Phillips, Roy Plummer, and Bert Weedon.', 'The electric Committee sat at the top of that trio of hollowbody models, with two pickups, showy fingerboard markers, an ornate headstock (Selmer called it “frondose,” a suitably fancy word for leaf-like), and an inlaid body back. The other two electric models, the single-pickup Senator and two-pickup President, each had distinctive triple-dot fingerboard markers.', 'By the end of the ‘50s, Selmer–Hofner was offering nine UK-only hollowbody electrics: the Golden Hofner, Committee, President, Senator, Club 40, Club 50, and Club 60. Selmer described the Golden Hofner, in acoustic or electric form, as Hofner’s “masterpiece of guitar perfection,” and it was certainly the most ornate and attractive electric Hofner.', 'Selmer began to sell the Golden Hofner, this most luxurious of models, around 1959. The natural-finish guitar sat at the top of the British pricelist and featured fancy pearl inlays on the ebony fingerboard and the “frondose” headstock, decorative inlay work on the flamed body rear (there was also a Thin version with thinline body), ornate binding, and gold-plated metalwork. Few were made, and it has become the most desirable Selmer–Hofner among collectors.', 'Hofner had reflected Gibson’s thinline concept with those Thin versions of some of its hollowbody models, but the double-cutaway Verithin, launched in 1960, was a more obvious Gibson-alike. There’s no doubting from its name that the Verithin was a thinline, and it had the Gibson 335’s double cutaway, too, but lacked the internal block, making it more akin to a 330.', 'Other Hofner hollowbody models during our period included the double-cut Ambassador and the Violin Guitar, a guitar version of the Hofner violin bass famous for its Beatle connection.', 'Bert Weedon, the busiest UK session guitarist of the ‘50s, was a star Selmer-Hofner endorser almost from the start. “Xmas stockings will be an odd shape this year if predictions of the biggest ever guitar sales come true,” Melody Maker reported in December 1957.', '“So popular is the instrument in Britain today that Selmer has organised an airlift of Hofner guitars from Germany. The first Lufthansa plane delivering nearly 1,000 guitars was greeted at London Airport this week by Bert Weedon. To help budding guitarists, Bert is making personal appearances at music stores giving advice and demonstrations.”', 'Bert worked backing US stars visiting the UK such as Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland, and in the studio he helped to create Britain’s take on rock’n’roll with acts such as Billy Fury and Tommy Steele (another Hofner user). Bert started his career with an English Abbot-Victor guitar but soon moved to Hofner, at first adding a pickup to an acoustic Committee and later playing various electric Hofners.', 'His hugely influential Play In A Day teaching book was first published in 1957, with Bert and Hofner prominent on the cover. He made regular radio and TV appearances and had his first solo hit in 1959 with “Guitar Boogie Shuffle,” a cover version of The Virtues’ electric arrangement of Arthur Smith’s late-‘40s “Guitar Boogie” instrumental. Bert was a great ambassador for the guitar and, at the same time, for Hofner.', 'Hofner’s Club 40 and Club 50 electrics first appeared in 1955. These one-pickup (the 40) and two-pickup (50) models had small single-cutaway hollow bodies and no f-holes, loosely styled after the shape and size of Gibson’s recent new Les Paul models. The Club 40 was Selmer’s version of Hofner’s own model 125, and the Club 50 was the British equivalent of the German 126.', 'Like most of Selmer’s early Hofner electrics, the Clubs can provide us with two main visual clues to their period of manufacture. The earliest British examples had thin pickups with black plastic covers, coupled with a distinctive oval-shape panel for the guitar’s controls', 'By 1958, the style shifted to a new rectangular control plate, which Selmer called “the new flick action change,” and soon after that the electrics were given more conventional looking metal-covered pickups of various types.', 'The better quality two-pickup Club 60 model, with its ebony board and fancy inlays, was added to Selmer’s line in 1958, and the two-pickup Club 70 model appeared toward the end of the ‘60s after the demise of the 40, 50, and 60, notable visually as the only Club with controls mounted to the body.', 'Selmer’s first solidbody electric Hofners were the Colorama models, introduced around 1956. These first versions were cheap looking and basic (but “virtually indestructible,” Selmer noted helpfully), with a single cutaway, offered in one or two-pickup versions, and in various colors with a contrasting pickguard.', 'Later Coloramas included models with a double-cut body and Fender-style six-a-side headstock, and by the late ‘60s they had an offset body style. Other Selmer–Hofner solids were the offset V series in the early ‘60s and the Strat-style Super series a little later in that decade.', 'In 1963, Selmer introduced its most convincing solidbody Hofner, the offset Galaxie, the one that so attracted the young Phil Manzanera. It had strong stylistic hints of the Fender Stratocaster, combined with Hofner’s flair for detailed control systems, a typical German touch of the period.', 'The Galaxie had a Solo/Rhythm boost switch, three individual pickup tone wheels, a master volume wheel, and three pickup on–off switches marked Bass On, “Discant” On, and Treble On.', 'Selmer’s catalogue, never a document to hold back on the hype, claimed that the Galaxie was “backed by the craftsmanship that’s made Hofner a name to be reckoned with.” It was a name, too, that defined an era for many British guitarists who began their love affair with the guitar at the time.', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

But some classic signature models have almost become more famous now than the players themselves. But who are these guitarists of yesteryear?', 'In our video above, we look at the players behind the names on these six classic signature guitar lines.', 'One of the more well-known players on our list today, Joe Pass became popular for his solo guitar work, as well as recording with Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gilespie and many others.', "In much of his career, he seemed to favor his Gibson ES-175, which he received as a gift in the early '60s upon leaving drug rehab, after a wealthy jazz fan realized that Joe did not own his own guitar. At the time, he was playing a Jazzmaster owned by the clinic.", "He used this ES-175 on early recordings and well into the '70s. It can be heard on the beautiful chord melodies on his esteemed record, Virtuoso, as well as on For Django 10 years earlier.", "In the '70s, Joe had a custom D'Aquisto single pickup guitar built for him. Then, the Ibanez Joe Pass JP20 was in production from 1981–1990. The intention from Ibanez was to produce a more affordable archtop. The JP20 was slightly based off of the D'Aquisto, and Pass played it through the '80s live and in the studio.", "There was yet another Joe Pass signature model, from Epihone, the Joe Pass Emperor II, released shortly before Pass's death in 1994. But by this time, Joe had circled back to the Gibson ES-175, and now, it was custom-built for Joe, with the pickup immediately adjacent to the fingerboard.", 'Mary Kaye, otherwise known as "the first lady of rock \'n\' roll," was an early, influential guitarist who played a role in defining Vegas lounge music. And her signature guitar has an interesting story, which starts with a photo from 1956.', 'Mary Kaye and her trio bandmates were part of a Fender ad promo. In the photo, Kaye is holding the guitar that she would soon be associated with forever.', 'The guitar, which did not belong to her at the time, was the first custom Fender Stratocaster ever produced, and the first model Fender issued in this color scheme—a distinctive ash blond body with gold hardware.', "Now, before this photo, and after, Kaye used D'Angelico guitars, but the image of her with this Strat became popular in ads all over the world, as well as in the film Cha-Cha-Cha-Boom!", "It wasn't until 2005 that Fender issued the Limited Signature Mary Kaye Tribute Stratocaster. Then two years later, after Kaye passed away, they issued a special reissue 1957 Mary Kaye Commemorative Stratocaster, made to original 1957 specs.", 'Next on our list is the wonderful Barney Kessel—a prominent American Jazz guitarist that recorded with jazz greats Charlie Parker and Sonny Rollins, as well as pop groups like The Monkees and The Beach Boys. He was an early member of all-star studio session group, The Wrecking Crew.', "In 1957, Chicago's Kay Musical Instruments launched a line of guitars bearing Barney Kessel's signature. These guitars had a short original run, being discontinued in 1960, though as of 2019, the revived Kay brand is making them once again.", 'In 1961, Gibson launched the Barney Kesssel signature in two different models—the Barney Kessel Custom, and the Barney Kessel Regular. These beautiful double Florentine cutaway models were in production until 1974.', 'This move by Gibson made sense, considering Kessel seemed to have been a Gibson fan, as the main guitar he wielded was a 1946/47 modified ES-350.', 'Did you know that the guy who wrote "Walk, Don\'t Run"—which The Ventures turned into a surf hit—was jazz guitarist Johnny Smith?', "Johnny Smith was an incredibly diverse player. He could hang with players at Birdland, and could also sight read his way through orchestral arrangements at The New York Philharmonic. He recorded with Stan Getz in the critically acclaimed'Moonlight In Vermont.", 'Johnny has designed signature guitars with Guild, Gibson, and Heritage.', 'First was Guild, with the Johnny Smith Award, which was issued in 1955.', 'Then in 1961, Gibson president Ted McCarty, in an effort to expand the production of their hollowbody electric guitars with influential players, spent some time with Smith—and had Smith design the guitar he wanted. Gibson put it into production shortly after.', "With two signature guitars in Johnny Smith's name, there would soon be opportunity for a third. When the Gibson factory moved from Kalamazoo, Michigan, to Nashville in 1984, some of the builders stayed in Kalamazoo and formed Heritage Guitars. Smith's loyalty remained with these artisans in Kalamazoo, and together they designed the Heritage Johnny Smith, a model that was introduced in 1989.", 'Then, in 2004 Johnny returned his endorsement to Guild, knowing that master luthier Bob Benedetto would be supervising the construction. The Guild Johnny Smith Award by Benedetto was available for the next couple years, until Benedetto left Fender, with whom Guild was a subsidiary.', 'Guild, Gibson, Heritage, Guild, and the Gibson model is still available—now as the LeGrand.', 'But signature guitars aside, if you want to listen to one of the most beautiful performances ever recorded, check out Johnny Smith\'s version of "Shenandoah."', 'One of the most distinguished American jazz guitarists, songwriters, and singers, George Benson, is next on our list.', 'Benson is a prime example of an artist who has been able to successfully cross over from playing jazz to R&B to pop. He has recorded with the likes of Miles Davis, Freddie Hubbard, and Stevie Wonder, and he is known for his entertainment sensibilities as well as raw talent. He is a star.', "George Benson has always gravitated towards full hollowbodied F-hole electrics. And in 1977, Ibanez issued their first hollowbody artist signature guitar, in Benson's name: the GB10. It is also the longest running model in the company's history.", 'Several other models in this line have been released since, including the GB15, GB20, GB100, and GB200. And even as recently as 2012, another model, the LGB300, was released.', 'The last on our list today is a Mexican-American guitarist from Dallas, Texas, Trinidad "Trini" Lopez.', "Trini was seen in the early '60s playing a Barney Kessel Custom. And Gibson, having issued a few signature models for jazz players like Kessel and Johnny Smith, was now turning towards this young Latino artist who was then approaching pop stardom.", 'As Lopez was digging the Kessel model, he wanted to simply add a few features to customize to his style. This model, with the double cutaway Florentine horns, would become the Trini Lopez Deluxe. And he also inspired a more "rock model" design, based on an ES-335, which would become the Trini Lopez Standard.', "This was the first time that an artist had two very contrasting models with their signature on both, which paved the way for other artists to have these opportunities, including Chet Atkins, Les Paul, and B.B. King. Not to mention the obvious influence the Lopez Standard had on Dave Grohl's signature axe.", "All of these signature guitars have stories, as do the players behind them. Instruments of all stylings speak to us in different ways, not only tonally, but in terms of inspiration and image as well. The image of Mary Kaye with that Strat can have just as profound of an impact on someone as the tone of the Joe Pass model. Inspiration comes in all forms, and there's no slowing that down.", 'What are some of your favorite signature models?

Hancock\'s 1978 album Sunlight prominently features the Sennheiser Vocoder VSM201, a newly manufactured device that thinned and buffed his voice to a futuristic shine on the album\'s disco-inflected A-side. On songs like "I Thought It Was You" and "Come Running To Me," Hancock\'s heavily processed voice pitches higher than its natural range, its guttural qualities swapped out for an airy computerized whine. It\'s a voice that matches its partly synthesized, partly acoustic instrumentation, a tone caught between worlds—not quite human and not quite machine, but a third, cyborgian presence.', 'First developed in the early 20th century and used during World War II to encrypt telephone conversations between world leaders, the vocoder sneaked its way into popular music in the early \'70s by way of the soundtrack to Stanley Kubrick\'s 1971 science fiction movie, A Clockwork Orange. (The generic term "vocoder," a portmanteau of "voice" and "encoder," has since been applied to many different vocal-manipulation devices.) Wendy Carlos, whose 1968 album, Switched-On Bach, was largely responsible for popularizing the Moog synthesizer, signed on to write and perform a score fitting the movie\'s dystopian ambiance. The film\'s protagonist loves Beethoven, and Carlos and her primary collaborator Rachel Elkind had already begun work on a synth adaptation of the Ninth Symphony with its famous choral setting "Ode to Joy."', 'They had tried before, with little success, to get the Moog to "sing," but found it could not convincingly enunciate consonants. Rather than conjure up a voice fully from inside the machine, Carlos opted to filter Elkind\'s singing voice through a vocoder, a technology she had first encountered at the Bell Labs Pavilion during the New York World\'s Fair of 1964–65. The result fit the sound of the Moog perfectly: This cyborg voice retained enough human qualities to be decipherable, even as it was plated over with pristine computer tones. Early listeners were skeptical of the new sound. "The first reactions were unanimous: Everyone hated it!" Carlos wrote on her website decades later. "A playing synth was bad enough, but a \'singing\' synth? Too much, turn it off!"', '', 'Not long after Carlos and Elkind first applied the vocoder to music, it began reverberating across national borders, from the United States to Germany and Japan and back again. With each iteration, it accumulated new meaning and potential. In the soundtrack to A Clockwork Orange, the vocoder\'s cyborg presence deepened the movie\'s considerations of what it might mean to "program" a person against his will—to empty him of self-determination and turn him into something more like a computer. Across the Atlantic in Düsseldorf a few years later, the groundbreaking electronic band Kraftwerk began deploying the vocoder in their own explorations of personhood and technology.', "On albums like 1977's Trans-Europe Express, 1978's The Man-Machine, and 1981's Computer World, Kraftwerk sought to locate the role of the human in an increasingly surveilled and automated modern world. They declared themselves robots, speak-singing in dry, modulated tones over impossibly tight drum machine beats and synthesized arpeggios. Singing into machines, they professed their love for computers, serenading not the person on the other end of the line but the cold, impartial screens of the connective devices themselves. Though Kraftwerk's music was future-oriented (and certainly prescient), they rarely incubated a sense of cynicism or dystopia in their work. Their melodies slant upwards, more innocent than all-knowing; they sound helpless and in awe of technology rather than terrified of it.", "The open ambivalence toward technology that Kraftwerk maintained throughout their seminal work in the '70s and early '80s made their music and its techniques easy to reinterpret. Their use of the vocoder radiated into Herbie Hancock's work (he used the Sennheiser on 1979's Feets Don't Fail Me Now as well as Sunlight), populated Italo-disco producer Giorgio Moroder's 1977 album, From Here to Eternity, and found its way into the albums of the Japanese band Yellow Magic Orchestra. Beginning in the early '80s, the vocoder would begin to make a natural home in the new, Bronx-based genre of hip-hop—a form of music that, like Kraftwerk, challenged conventional narratives about the relationships between human beings and novel technology.", 'If a genre can be said to originate from a single moment in time, then hip-hop\'s starting point is well-documented. It sprang from a high school party at the end of the summer of 1973, hosted by a teenage DJ Kool Herc and his sister, Cindy Campbell. Herc spun records for his friends on his parents\' soundsystem in the rec room of their apartment building, opting for songs with long instrumental breakdowns that inspired the crowd to dance. His friend, Coke La Rock, started shouting out the names of his friends over these vocal-free segments, a musical style derived from Jamaican toasting that would later become rap. Word of the music at the party spread through the Bronx, and as Herc got hired at more and more gigs, he began extending the drum breakdowns of the soul and funk records he played, spinning two copies of the same record simultaneously and resetting the needle so that the break went on indefinitely. He dubbed this technique "the merry-go-round."', 'In this way, from its beginning, hip-hop consciously reinscribed the potential meaning of the consumer technology on which it depended. A turntable, as a product, came pre-loaded with a specific model of music consumption: It was meant to play a record from beginning to end, to serve as a delivery device for prerecorded music. It was never intended to be an instrument in itself, just an intermediary between record company and listener. Hip-hop, along with its Manhattan cousin disco, positioned the listener as an artist in her own right—someone who could take consumer products designed for passive consumption and flip them around into active, dynamic tools.', 'In an interview with Mark Dery for his 1993 book, Flame Wars, science-fiction author Samuel R. Delany noted the challenge that hip-hop posed to the technological tools in its arsenal. "To look at any of these black cultural youth movements as an easy and happy development blossoming uncritically from the overwhelmingly white world of high-tech production that, yes, makes that culture possible is, I suspect, thoroughly to misread the fiercely oppositional nature of this art: scratch and sampling begin, in particular, as a specific miss-use and conscientious desecration of the artifacts of technology and the entertainment media," he said.', 'The vocoder, another technology misapplied toward musical purposes, fit neatly into this schema, and by 1982 had found its place in hip-hop.', 'The subgenre known as electro-boogie bloomed that year, when the Boston-based rap group Jonzun Crew, the Bronx DJ and rapper Afrika Bambaataa, and the Bronx hip-hop group Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five all released pivotal vocoder-based singles. Jonzun Crew\'s "Pack Man (Look Out For The OVC)" drew references to Sun Ra\'s jazz Afrofuturism into a hip-hop context ("OVC" stands for "Outerspace Visual Communicator," a video synthesizer played by its creator, Bill Sebastian, at Sun Ra concerts in the late \'70s). Amid detuned arpeggios, sparse percussion, and minor key motifs in the style of Kraftwerk, a deeply corroded voice rasps, chants, and laughs. The song\'s title can be made out, and the name of the Outerspace Visual Communicator, and little else. The song plays like a garbled transmission from a distant planet; its central voice, engulfed in immeasurable space, holds a certain authority, as if it were calling out from a world more advanced than our own, and unintelligible in its advancement.', 'Jonzun Crew\'s 1983 debut album, Lost in Space, introduced more concrete pop elements to the group\'s futuristic sound, all while highlighting the vocoder as a primary tool. It once again pointed to Sun Ra as an ancestor with the song "Space is the Place," a reinterpretation of the Afrofuturist visionary\'s iconic 1973 track. If Sun Ra deployed the tools of jazz toward an expansive, utopian future, Jonzun Crew broke out of their own constraining present with instruments that gestured toward a post-human landscape, a place where the line between human and machine blurred away. The group readily transformed themselves into cyborgs with the vocoder, but their work\'s finer details retained a sense of human embodiment.', 'Toward the end of "Space is the Place," Jonzun Crew stage a call-and-response coda, a technique with deep roots in Black gospel. "You must follow me," speaks one voice, and a chorus of voices answers: "We will follow you." "You must follow me to space," clarifies the first voice, and as the vocals fade out, the sound of heavy breathing replaces them. By its nature, the vocoder irons out non-utterances like breathing. The song concludes not with the sound of robots blasting off into the heavens, but with the sound of a panicked, disoriented human being taking stock of an alien environment.', 'The year 1982 also saw the release of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five\'s "Scorpio," an electro single from the album The Message that similarly deployed the vocoder toward thinning and granulating the human voice to the point of near-unrecognizability. That same year, Afrika Bambaataa and the Soulsonic Force\'s landmark single "Planet Rock" interpolated two Kraftwerk songs—"Trans Europe Express," from which it gets its beat and synth motif, and "Numbers," from which it takes a vocoder sample—toward its own vision of post-industrial humankind. Bambaataa also processed his own voice on the track, using a vocoder and a Lexicon PCM42 digital delay to lend his raps a gleaming metallic edge. While "Pack Man" and "Scorpio" both carried an air of future menace in their refusal to yield the voice and their insistence on an enigmatic cyborgian presence, "Planet Rock" focused more on how technology could bolster, rather than disappear, the human. Bambaataa\'s calls and responses sound more as though he\'s speaking to a real, live crowd, rather than a congregation of robots. His sparing use of voice processing technologies line the song with futuristic potentials without drowning it in them. Technology is the starting point, but people are the end goal.', 'In Flame Wars, Mark Dery asks hip-hop scholar Tricia Rose how the use of consumer technology squares with the Black musical tradition. "Can one be funky and mechanical?" he queries. "No question; that\'s what hip-hop is!" she replies. "If we understand the machine as a product of human creativity whose parameters are always suggesting what\'s beyond them, then we can read hip-hop as the response of urban people of color to the postindustrial landscape... What Afrika Bambaataa and hip-hoppers like him saw in Kraftwerk’s use of the robot was an understanding of themselves as already having been robots. Adopting ‘the robot’ reflected a response to an existing condition: namely, that they were labor for capitalism, that they had very little value as people in this society. By taking on the robotic stance, one is ‘playing with the robot.’ It’s like wearing body armor that identifies you as an alien: if it’s always on anyway, in some symbolic sense, perhaps you could master the wearing of this guise in order to use it against your interpolation."', 'The idea of anticapitalist body armor appeared not just in electro-boogie\'s sound but also its costumes. Afrika Bambaataa and the Soulsonic Force wore flowing lame robes in the Afrofuturist tradition of Sun Ra and Parliament-Funkadelic for the "Planet Rock" video, while Jonzun Crew donned motorcycle helmets and sparkling military jackets for "Pack Jam." These outfits obscured the performers without fully roboticizing them, much as the vocoder did to their voices. If, in the 1980s, white society was content to file Black people away as cheap labor with no further value, Black artists responded by transforming themselves into cyborgs. Shut out from the full sphere of the human, but not content to be machines, either, they employed the vocoder as a mutating tool, an escape hatch from an impossible dichotomy. Bambaataa, Flash, and Jonzun Crew fashioned themselves a third entity, and found a way out.', '', 'In the 21st century, following the success of Cher\'s 1998 single, "Believe," the pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune has largely replaced vocoder as the voice processing method du jour, used to great effect by artists like T-Pain and Charli XCX. One notable holdout from the \'90s is Daft Punk, the French duo who siphoned techniques from house and electro-boogie to massive popularity and acclaim. Their robot voices derive from Black American uses of vocoder, in addition to Kraftwerk and Giorgio Moroder, and like many European mimics they have greatly outsold their influences. Singles like "Technologic" and "Harder Better Faster Stronger" loop vocoded phrases that vaguely gesture toward their capitalist environments through breezy, easily digestible pop structures, largely defanging the modes of resistance that have coursed through much of the vocoder\'s history.', 'The chirpy, French-accented vocals of "Harder Better Faster Stronger" were rerouted into hip-hop in 2007, when Kanye West sampled the song on his single "Stronger." If Daft Punk\'s original track cheerily gargled words that could have been taken from a manual on worker optimization, West\'s take funneled the same phrases into a biting tale of survival at any cost. The song\'s video borrows posthuman imagery from the 1988 anime Akira, casting West as Tetsuo, a biologically engineered teenager who has broken out of his captors\' control. He replaces the original\'s busy house beat with a darker and more pummeling drum pattern that lets its hi-hat linger, and raps seethingly over Daft Punk\'s vocoder. The phrase he loops the most from "Harder Better Faster Stronger" is the one that dips into a startlingly low register on the last two words: "Our work is never over." Taken into West\'s hands, the phrase bleeds menace. It\'s no longer merely a description of capitalism and the place of the human being within it, a source of eternal labor. Instead, it rings defiantly, the cyborg voice clanging against a cyborg beat, seeking escape and beginning the long, hard task of building the world to come.', 'About the author: Sasha Geffen is the author of Glitter Up the Dark: How Pop Music Broke the Binary, out now from the University of Texas Press.

His point won’t be lost today on guitar makers of any size, but it was a factor just as relevant around 1950, when the small new Fender company was taking its early steps toward greatness.', 'We all know how good a Fender guitar or amp from that period can be, whether by personal experience or received reputation. But without an efficient and assiduous sales operation, those wonderful instruments would have piled up in the factory with nowhere to go. Someone had to actually go out and sell Fender gear.', 'When Leo Fender opened his radio store in Fullerton in Orange County in the late 1930s, the ex-accountant probably kept his sales research pretty simple. He’d take notice of what his customers bought, make some calls when they asked him to get something he didn’t have, and examine carefully the items they brought in for repair. Leo’s business card reflected his stock and services: “Electrical appliances, phonograph records, musical instruments & repairs, public address systems, sheet music.”', 'Plenty of local musicians were regulars, including Clayton Orr “Doc” Kauffman, a professional violinist and lap-steel guitarist. Around 1940, Doc brought an amplifier into the store for repair, and the two got chatting.', 'Leo was 31, Doc 38, and Leo was fascinated when the older man told him how he’d amplified guitars and made designs for an electric guitar and a vibrato system. Leo was already looking into the potential for electric guitars and was playing around with pickup designs. The two men became friends.', 'Doc worked for an aircraft company during the war, while Leo, excused military service on health grounds, expanded his shop’s trade. The two tinkerers built a crude testbed solidbody electric guitar and secured a patent for its string-driven electro-magnetic pickup. They also produced a design for a phonograph record-changer and sold the rights for $5,000, using the windfall to jump-start their short-lived company, K&F (for Kauffman & Fender).', 'By now, Leo had a new location in Fullerton for his store, using the front part as the retail shop and the rear for making K&F products. In mid-1945, Leo and Doc built a handful of electric steels and amps and started concerted production in November with revised designs. It was a modest operation, but Leo must have been keen to sell the K&F gear beyond his own store.', 'The way instrument companies worked then—and mostly still do—was to employ a distributor, who would market the products at trade prices to dealers and other outlets. The big names often had their own outfit, or were linked to a parent company that took care of distribution—as with Gibson and Chicago Musical Instrument. Smaller firms like K&F had to look around for something within their range.', 'Leo knew all the distributor salesmen who visited his store—among them, Don Randall, the general manager of Radio-Tel (short for Radio & Television Equipment Co). Radio-Tel was owned by Francis Hall and based in Santa Ana, some 15 miles south of Fullerton, and as the name suggests, Radio-Tel dealt mostly in TV and radio-related stuff.', '', 'Don, who had spent three years in the Army, was looking for opportunities when the war ended. He started doing business with Leo again, selling him parts and equipment. Early in 1946, Radio-Tel became the exclusive distributor for K&F products, and Don’s chief salesman there, Charlie Hayes, headed the push to persuade dealers to stock Leo and Doc’s little steels and amps.', 'It was around this time that Doc pulled out of K&F, not least because Leo’s workaholic approach didn’t suit him, and he was nervous about the firm’s almost constant struggle with cash flow. Meanwhile, Leo moved on. He revised the setup and called the new company Fender Manufacturing, renaming it the Fender Electric Instrument Co at the end of ’47. He and a few employees continued to make steels and amps as he had with K&F.', 'Business was still slow, and Leo had to rely on a loan from Francis Hall at Radio-Tel to keep going. Leo was an introverted, hard-working man who enjoyed long hours and selfless application to the job, happiest by himself drawing designs for new projects. He thought that if there was a product on the market already, he could make it better and cheaper—and make a profit in the process.', 'With the war over, a fresh start loomed. Leo’s application of mass production to guitar manufacturing would be his masterstroke. But for now, he really needed to sell what he made.', 'Dale Hyatt had come on board in the first few weeks of ’46, at first helping to make the K&F steels, which with the change of company name very soon gained a Fender brand. “I was hand-sanding and making bodies,” Dale told me when we met in the ‘90s.', '“I was making them out of pine, painting them with grey paint, and sticking them in the oven until you got a crackle finish. There were about three or four people working there at that time. The steel guitars were the big thing, that was the craze that was on. There were a few amplifiers being put together, too, but very few.”', 'An early ad for the Fender Electric Instrument Co’s wares in the late-‘40s showed just three lap-steels and a couple of amps. “The company didn’t change much at first—we didn’t have enough money to change anything very fast. You could change the name, but you didn’t really change what you were doing,” Dale added with a laugh.', 'He recalled that the store-cum-workshop was located at 107 South Spadra Road in Fullerton. All these years later, that road today is called South Harbor Boulevard, and the building survives. If you want to look at it on Google’s Street View, you’ll see that 107 South Harbor now boasts a sign for Ellingson—a firm that makes parts for the aerospace industry.', '“It’s just south of the main intersection in Fullerton at Harbor and Commonwealth,” Dale told me back in ’92. “Yes, the building is still there, but the tin shed where we actually made those early guitars on the back side of the building has been torn down. The last time I was over there and looked it up, the concrete slab for the shed was all that was left of it, and they were pulling up and parking on it.”', 'Leo expanded production into larger premises nearby at 122 Pomona Avenue, at the corner of Santa Fe Avenue, separate from the radio store and described by one of his associates as “two plain steel buildings, not very handsome.” Meanwhile, Don Randall and his colleagues at Radio-Tel continued to sell the early Fender steels and amps. “They placed some pretty good orders and production boomed for a while,” Dale recalled.', '“Then, all of a sudden, the economy went downhill and we had a big recession in that period of time. I was the only one working in the daytime, and Leo would come in during the evening, because the bank was looking for him, trying to foreclose—that was probably the summer of ’47, maybe into ’48.”', 'Radio-Tel wasn’t the only Fender distributor at the time. “Radio-Tel was the first distributor and they’re given all the credit for Fender, but that’s not exactly so. There was a company called Pacific Music Supply,” Dale added, “and they were located in Los Angeles. They’re often overlooked. About 1950, a total of about five salesmen were working for the company.”', 'No one is sure who first came up with the idea of a Fender Spanish-style electric—the type today we’d think of as a regular guitar, in contrast to a lap-steel—although the Radio-Tel salesman Charlie Hayes may have suggested it to Leo. If he did, then it must surely count as the most important contribution he made to the company’s prosperity, even beyond all the amps and instruments he sold and the dozens of dealers he enrolled and encouraged.', 'As all good Fender historians know, the company launched its two-pickup Broadcaster solidbody in 1950, soon renaming it Telecaster (alongside the single-pickup Esquire). This marked the change of course that would make the Fender name. It was at this time that Leo added a more permanent concrete building alongside the two steel ones on Pomona Avenue, presumably with increased production in mind.', 'Dale Hyatt saw it all firsthand. “We sold guitars directly out of the factory, and I sold many of them on the bandstand myself, simply out of necessity to keep bringing money in. Leo and I and George Fullerton, we’d go out on to the bandstands, contact the individuals, meet the guitar players who might want to use them.”', 'Also at this time, Dale had taken over Leo’s store. “He had got so busy with the factory that he couldn’t manage both,” Dale said. “So I made a deal with him to buy his music store back, and I was selling the merchandise. I was out every night somewhere. Some bandstand somewhere, if there was some group playing, I was out there with the new guitar. But I didn’t last too long with the store. I had a very short tenure as a music merchant,” he said with a smile.', "“'Course, right after the war, things were hard to get, television was just beginning, and there was a big change in the record industry,” Dale continued. “I couldn’t see any future in that. So in ’51 I closed up the radio shop, went to work for Douglas Aircraft as a tool-and-die maker, but I didn’t like that too well. I finally decided I wanted to be in the sales end, which I enjoyed. I joined a company selling automobiles, first Hudson, then the Mercury dealership in Fullerton—and as a matter of fact I sold Lincolns to Mr. Fender. I was always in contact with him.”", 'The new solidbody model did not prove immediately easy to sell, as Don Randall soon discovered. When he went to the NAMM instruments trade show in Chicago in July 1950 he had a sample of the new guitar with him. Don represented Fender alongside salesmen Charlie Hayes and Don Patton at Radio-Tel’s display at the Palmer House. Don said he got laughed out of the place, that their new guitar was called everything from a canoe paddle to a snow shovel.', 'He did have at least one useful meeting at that show, when Al Frost from National explained that the absence of neck strengthening in the sample would likely cause problems later for neck stability. Don immediately contacted Leo and told him plainly that they must have a truss rod in the new guitar. Leo replied that they didn’t need one, saying that his neck was rock maple and pretty sturdy. Don was not pleased and suggested that no truss rod would mean no sales. The tussle was concluded and the result was that a few early Fender solidbody models had no rod, but soon they were leaving the Pomona Avenue factory with a truss rod in place.', 'Dale Hyatt, meanwhile, had to struggle with a less than serious view of the new Fenders when he tried to sell some further north. He had his samples and was out selling them in Manteca, a few miles inland from San Francisco. Dale’s brother, who lived in the area, had tipped him off about all the country musicians playing around town—just the kind of players who were beginning to show interest in the new Fender electric.', '“They had these nightclubs going and guys playing honky-tonk and country-western,” Dale told me about Manteca. “I’d taken five guitars with me. So I got a guy playing one. He quite liked it—and all of a sudden it just quit, and he didn’t know what was wrong with it. It was embarrassing. So I went out to the truck and got another one. It lasted about 30 minutes and it quit. Then they started saying: ‘There he goes again, ladies and gentlemen—wonder how many he’s got?’ Anyway, the third one kept on going and worked for the rest of the evening.”', 'Dale had stumbled on a weakness of the solidbody’s pickup shielding in the most public way imaginable. This was the cost of trying to sell pre-production versions and working prototypes. “But anyhow, that was the start of it,” Dale said, laughing at the memory.', '“That gentleman came down to my brother’s house the next day and brought his son’s electric train set, which he wanted to trade for one of the guitars. Another of the first ones sold of what we now know as the Telecaster—it might have been the second or third I sold, I’m not sure—was to a gentleman in Long Beach. He was one of the very first people to buy Leo Fender’s solidbody guitar, and I know he played that thing for years and years.”', 'Meanwhile, business picked up as news of the Telecaster and Esquire spread and as Radio-Tel’s five salesmen—Charlie Hayes, Don Patton, Dave Driver, Mike Cole, and Art Bates—began to persuade store owners to stock the company’s new solidbody instruments. Fender launched another important instrument at the end of 1951, the Precision Bass, the first commercially successful solidbody electric bass guitar.', 'Early in 1953, Fender’s existing sales deal with Radio-Tel was reorganized into a new distribution company, Fender Sales, operational by June. Based like Radio-Tel in Santa Ana, Fender Sales had four business partners: Leo Fender, Don Randall, Francis Hall, and Charlie Hayes—the last three all from Radio-Tel.', 'In June that year, Fender acquired a three-and-a-half-acre plot at South Raymond Avenue and Valencia Drive in Fullerton and put up three new buildings. Fullerton’s City Council was on a programme of rapid and significant industrial development.', '“Prior to 1950,” the Los Angeles Times reported, “Fullerton was a citrus area with its industries primarily devoted to citrus products and food processing.” The paper quoted a Fullerton official on the changes being made in the new decade. “Everyone liked the peaceful area geared to country living. But some began to realize that industry was needed to balance the economy as more and more people came in. Now there’s almost 100 percent support for [the expansion].”', 'Fender’s new buildings in the heart of Fullerton’s development area were a sign that the company was continuing to expand its line of products. As well as the two electric guitars, the Telecaster and Esquire, Fender had a line of seven amplifiers—the Bandmaster, Bassman, Champ, Deluxe, Princeton, Super, Twin Amp—along with five electric steel guitars—Custom, Deluxe, Dual, Stringmaster, Student—and the Precision Bass. But the firm wanted to produce more. The Music Trades magazine reported that, with its new property, Fender “hoped that production will be upped by almost 100 percent in the next few months.”', 'First, however, the haphazard production methods that had developed without much planning or forethought over the last few years needed to be organized more efficiently. This job fell into the capable hands of Forrest White, who joined the firm in May 1954 and set about the uphill task of improving the workflow throughout the growing Fender factory.', 'Toward the end of ’53, Francis Hall brought about his own departure from Fender Sales by buying the Rickenbacker company from Adolph Rickenbacker—in the process effectively becoming a competitor. Two years later, Fender Sales would shift down in size again, to a partnership between just Leo and Don, when Charlie Hayes was killed in a road accident. In reality, though, it was Don who ran this pivotal part of the Fender business.', 'Dale Hyatt remembered well the tragic accident in 1955 that ended the career of Charlie Hayes. “He was the top salesman in the country,” Dale said. “I was still working at the Lincoln dealership, and about 5 o’clock one day I took Leo’s Lincoln back to him after it had been serviced at our shop. Charlie and Leo were there and everybody else was gone. I talked to Charlie for a while, then I left with the two of them—Charlie was leaving the next day for the NAMM show in Chicago. On the way home, he was killed in a three-car accident. His car didn’t show that much damage—and I had sold him that automobile—but he died en route to the hospital.”', 'One thing led to another, and Dale ended up taking over Charlie’s patch. “I think through Leo’s insistence and so on, I was hired to go into the field to sell Fender. I know there were a lot of other people wanted the job, so it must have been Mr. Fender who did the pushing on my behalf. And that’s how I came to go back into selling Fender, in 1955.”', 'Fender was into a new era, the early days of struggle were mostly behind it, and this part of the story draws to a close. By the time of Dale’s return, the new Stratocaster was on sale. “Yes, and of course it became the hit of rock’n’roll,” Dale said. ”Even though Fender started off with the country enthusiasts, it really did start with rock. And later, when guys like Jimi Hendrix came along playing all that wild stuff, then we couldn’t build enough of them. As a matter of fact, I think Jimi Hendrix caused more Stratocasters to be sold than all the Fender salesmen put together.”', 'I asked Dale if he was surprised to have someone like Jimi as a leading Fender salesman. He laughed, then added: “As a matter of fact, he was not one of my favorite musicians, not at all. I never could get with it. To me it sounded like a bunch of junk. I have to hear a melody for it to be pleasing. I’m still the same today.”', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

Upon arriving at Auschwitz, his father, Henry, was recognized as a famous violinist. He was regularly asked to play for the commandant, which he did on the condition that his son wouldn\'t be harmed. Miraculously, they hung on until the Allied liberation, and emigrated to New York shortly after.', '"I arrived when I was 11 years old. I didn\'t read or write in any language. I didn\'t speak English. But I wanted to be an American very badly, so I jumped into the melting pot. I went to the movies, watched cartoons, and looked at comic books. I played marbles with the kids on Steinway Street, and in one year I spoke perfect English," Rosner recalls.', "Rosner grew up to be an engineer, and took a defense industry job, but lived a parallel life as a hi-fi enthusiast around the time the term was being coined. As a student he'd built his own speakers from cardboard, and went on to design a soundsystem for the pavilion at the '64 World's Fair, but it was a chance encounter, while dining, that changed the course of his life. The club's system sounded so bad he gave the owner his card, and before he knew it he was redesigning it.", "Not long after, he made his passion his full-time career. He read Paul Klipsch's audiophile dispatches, The Dope From Hope, and began repping the products. (Klipsch had debuted his world-famous Klipschorn—arguably the first real high-fidelity speaker—in Hope, Arkansas, around the time Rosner arrived in the US.)", 'He would lug heavy amps to clients, sometimes on foot, and build things if they didn\'t exist. As two turntable systems were developing he realized mixers didn\'t have the cuing features we take for granted these days, so he modified a Bozak unit, and called it "Rosie" after its red paint job. (Modular synth fans will recognize that the name lives on in Make Noise\'s mixer module of the same name, which also has a cuing feature.)', 'One on-the-job lesson followed another, and his expertise grew, but what would become his philosophy was forged one night when he got an emergency call at 1 am, which wasn\'t unusual. The system at Ginza, a club owned by his friend Robert Chiu, had failed, the patrons immediately left, and he was hemorrhaging money. "Mr. Chiu knew his stuff. He had two Altec speakers, a McIntosh MC275 amplifier, two Thorens TD124 turntables, and a mono Altec 1567A mixer. It sounded terrific."', 'The only problem was it was all driven by a single amp, which proved to be its Achilles heel on that particular night. Rosner quickly fixed it, and then had a vision:', '"I was crossing the desert in a chariot. Arrows were coming at me from all directions. If I stop, I\'m dead. If a horse trips, I have to be able to cut it loose and still have enough to keep going. I\'ve gotta have redundant, concentric wheels, in case one breaks. I cannot stop under any circumstances. The chariot is the soundsystem. It has to be designed in such a way that it can never fail, because the patrons leave and, you know, they may never come back. What I learned that night was the most important lesson of my disco career."', "David Mancuso moved to New York in the early '60s at the dawn of a major cultural revolution, immersing himself in all the city had to offer, far beyond what was typical. He explored the better-known hippie enclaves, but also worked his way uptown at a time few white people did. He studied the music he was hearing at rent parties in Harlem, and went to live performances, feeding his insatiable curiosity.", 'In the mid-\'60s he became enamored of Timothy Leary, attended his lectures, paying particular attention to his Tibetan Book of the Dead–inspired text, The Psychedelic Experience. Eventually he ended up deeper in Leary\'s circle, and was invited to private parties at his "League for Spiritual Discovery" offices.', "Two of the most meaningful things in Mancuso's life, at the time, were gathering with friends to enjoy music as a group and experimenting with psychedelics, and the two paired very well. As the nuances of music became increasingly more important to him, he fell into the orbit of fellow enthusiast Richard Long, purchased some hi-fi equipment from him, including some Klipschorns, and a friendship ensued.", 'Like Rosner, Mancuso was enthusiastic about The Dope From Hope. According to DJ Colleen "Cosmo" Murphy, "He would read those quite religiously, and shared many of Paul Klipsch\'s opinions."', 'Rosner recalls first meeting Mancuso: "I had become a Klipsch dealer. I think he may have had two Klipschorns already [referring to the speakers he\'d bought from Long]. I sold him some Cornwalls and some Model H series. In the early days of hi-fi, when you had two speakers in stereo and they were far apart, Klipsch recommended a center channel. There were several techniques for achieving this, but one just used a special transformer, and you stole a little bit of signal from the left channel and a little bit from the right. It made the impedance corrections. The problem was you couldn\'t adjust the center channel volume."', 'It didn\'t take Rosner long to figure out he wasn\'t dealing with a typical client: "With David it was less about his technical knowledge. He innately understood the acoustic problem, more in his heart than mind. We couldn\'t talk dBs, but he had a very clear understanding of what was needed to solve a problem, and I\'d fix it technically. If he didn\'t like it, we\'d try something else. My ego wasn\'t that big, and I was learning too."', 'Of course rooms tend to present challenges that aren\'t easily remedied. "The first thing you have to do is accept the space the way it is," Rosner says. "Most of the time it\'s your enemy, not your friend. I could go into a room and tell if it was good, fair, or terrific, but a few times I\'ve had to just tell the client it can\'t work. You\'re not going to hire an acoustic consultant like Al Fierstein and spend $100,000 fixing it."', "On Valentine's Day, 1970, Mancuso had what was officially the first Loft Party. Dubbed Love Saves the Day as a lysergic nod, it ostensibly was a weekly rent party intersecting with the counterculture but, in actuality, it was much more profound. By invitation only, people of all different races, genders, sexual orientations, and backgrounds gathered to listen and dance to music, often unfamiliar to them, but carefully selected for its special qualities, from fidelity to uniqueness, presented to them on a system of unparalleled quality.", 'Modern system designer Craig "Shorty" Bernabeu considers it "complete genius the way Alex and David designed it around a huge high-end consumer system. They also had to take into account necessary headroom, and how much time it would be used per night, which would be at least three times what a consumer used in a week."', 'The individual elements were by no means new. Soundsystem parties were a huge part of Jamaican culture, though fidelity wasn\'t really the focus. San Francisco\'s "Acid Tests" were designed to delight the senses and encourage free thought. Places like The Sanctuary, on W. 43rd St., were gay clubs, but also sites of some cultural crosspolination, unlike the bath houses that preceded it. The Loft, however, was a combination of those things, and more, providing an excellent-sounding safe space, and not just as defined in modern parlance.', "There was also a dedication to city ordinances, though David's home wasn't officially a club. Even in the wake of the Stonewall uprising, gay club patrons had been treated as second-class citizens. Low-grade cocktails, poor hygiene infrastructure, and lack of fire exits were overlooked by authorities on the assumption that attendees feared retribution. In some cases, well-known or wealthier clients were blackmailed if they wanted to stay closeted.", "Throughout The Loft's history Mancuso insisted that any attendee, gay or straight, sober or in an altered state of mind, regardless of race, should be free to be carried away by the music with no concerns about their well-being.", 'Douglas Sherman, a Loft attendee since 1979, said it even extended to people they hoped wouldn\'t show up: "We were setting up for the evening and David had me run out to buy some red buckets to fill with sand, to hang along the wall. It was about actual fire safety but also sending a message. Firemen risk their lives saving people, and if they showed up to check for violations we wanted them to see that we were thinking of them."', "No clocks or mirrors were allowed. Time was deemed meaningless, and the latter could make a person feel self-conscious when they were meant to let go. Alcohol wasn't served, but food and refreshments were included in the entrance fee. The common thread was all of the attendees had a deep connection with music and an interest in hearing it in its purest form.", 'Sherman explains that the arc of the evening, to this day, is supposed to mimic an acid trip. "People arrive and are greeted with mellower music. As the night goes on the music ramps up and sort of peaks, then there is a coming down period." It was inspired by Leary\'s take on The Tibetan Book of the Dead\'s three Bardos. Murphy, who has been an attendee, organizer, and selector at the Loft since the mid-\'80s, adds, "It\'s kind of a microcosm, trying to be an ideal vision of society, which relates to what people experience when they take LSD."', "Sherman would stay for the duration, and often arrived early on Saturday, sometimes to the mild annoyance of people setting up, so eventually they gave him odd jobs. This guaranteed he'd never miss the first song of the night. In time, after earning trust, he became a music selector, organizer and one of Mancuso's close friends.", '"This all took place in David\'s home, so people would take turns resting on his bed, or spending time in darker corners of his place, that only held a few people, then they\'d return to the party, ready to continue. Some would stay until 4 pm Sunday afternoon," Sherman recalls.', 'Murphy adds, "David wanted people to listen for eight or 12 hours and not come out with their ears ringing. He said he practiced \'safe sound,\' which was yet another gentle approach that protected the guest, because once you lose your hearing, you can\'t get it back."', 'All of this made Mancuso more like an MC of a sonic cocktail party rather than a DJ, which is why, even today, the music selectors at the parties eschew the term in favor of "Musical Host." Leary preached the absolute importance of "set and setting" to his disciples, and it had clearly influenced Mancuso\'s vision of The Loft.', "Up to this point, New York was a city with dance clubs, plenty of which catered exclusively to a gay clientele. It wasn't entirely unique in that regard. As the '70s emerged, however, it became the city for dance clubs, unchallenged, for much of the decade, and setting the bar globally. Between the time of Mancuso's incalculably influential first Loft parties and the disco-as-we-know-it years, there was a liminal period where more clubs were opening, still underground, but resembling what would soon come after.", "Better Days, Galaxy 21, SoHo Club, 12 West, Reade Street, and the Tenth Floor, to name a few, were writing the script for the next phase. Legendary DJ Nicky Siano opened The Gallery with his brother, and cut his teeth there. Its influence can't be overstated, and merits an article of its own. This was the world David DePino lived in; he was hitting all the clubs, and he was a Loft baby.", 'DePino remembers:', '"You know, when I think back I go, What the hell was my mother thinking? I looked 20, and had a mustache, but I was 14. I come from Mulberry Street, a white, Italian neighborhood, and my family was all mafia. My sister was six years older than me, and took cash at the door at some clubs my cousin\'s family owned. I told my mama I wanted to go. \'Alright, your sister will take you so you\'ll be safe,\' she said. I went and I was hooked. By 16 I was working at Sanctuary, which didn\'t even open until midnight! My mom asked me what the clubs were like. What did I do every night? I told her they were safe and she said if you ever do anything to embarrass us I\'ll go down to the club with a placard that says \'I\'M DAVID\'S MOM\' on it, and I was like, \'Don\'t you dare!\' Looking back I find it funny, but it terrorized me as a child. I first went to the Loft when I was 15 and immediately noticed the sound was very pure—Mancuso didn\'t blend songs, and there was no mixer to speak of. What the needle picked up is what the speakers put out. The Sanctuary was in an old church, so [the DJ] Francis Grasso had the organ behind him. He\'d hit the keys, and add to the music sometimes. David was a purist, cared deeply about sound, and the system at The Loft reflected that."', "In 1977, as things continued to fall into place in the club community, dance culture was growing, and pride and confidence was rising in the wake of Stonewall, a new idea for a club was emerging at a decommissioned parking garage at 84 King St., which had also had a short stint as the Chameleon Club. It represented a communion of ideas between a DJ, Larry Levan, who had been a Loft regular; Mancuso's old friend Richard Long, who was now designing soundsystems; and owner Michael Brody.", 'During the build-out phase, "construction parties" were held as a way to fine-tune the club and generate some cash flow. By coincidence, or by design, the official opening was Valentine\'s Day weekend, 1978. Levan had come from The Continental Baths, SoHo Club, and Reade St, ultimately landing at the Gallery, working alongside Siano, and Frankie Knuckles.', 'His reputation was growing, as was his deep understanding of how to build sets, effortlessly moving from Philly soul to Jamaican music, with its soundsystem tradition. Now it was time for Brody to build a club around him. DePino recounts:', '"Larry Levan and Richard Long designed a soundsystem first, and then the room was built to accommodate it, which had never happened before that I know of. David Mancuso had to cater his system to a room. Paradise Garage was a 20,000-square-foot space that was going to be sectioned off. The room where they\'d build the dance floor, and how they\'d do that, was designed around the kind of soundsystem that Larry wanted. The room was built for the sound, the sound was put in the room. Walls were built on two-inch tracks, so they moved with the bass. The floor was built on three-inch risers, to cushion your feet over a long night. That\'s what\'s wonderful about having a raw space and building it from scratch. Having an owner willing to spend the money to accommodate all of these aspects, and Larry\'s ideas were unheard of. Michael Brody was not greedy. If it was a good year, he\'d invest in making the club better. He didn\'t just stick it in his pocket."', 'Tim Lawrence, author of the extremely comprehensive Love Saves The Day: A History of American Dance Music Culture, 1970-1979, says, "Larry Levan was hugely influential when it came to the development of the Garage system. I don\'t know if he had quite the same influence over the system at the Garage as David did over his at the Loft, but it would have been close. He would make requests to Long and others, after which the engineers would seek to introduce his requests. As a symbol of his devotion to David and the Loft, his original idea had been for Alex to oversee the Garage system and for it to be built around Klipschorns, but in the end Larry decided that the space needed more power than they could generate."', 'During this ongoing conversation between DJ and tech, fidelity continued to be paramount, but some new ideas grabbed hold as well.', '"The Garage had a great system that would become the standard on which modern club systems are based, not Mancuso\'s," says Murphy. "Larry was a Loft devotee. He wanted a certain kind of Loft quality and clarity, but also a heavy bottom and punch. It was louder, and used subwoofers to enhance the bass for that physical experience, whereas Mancuso\'s was about having the music more floaty than punchy."', 'Indeed, Long developed the "Levan Horn" specifically to deliver more bass. Bernabeu adds, "Before the Garage there were no clubs with 10-foot-high stacks and massive bass cabinets. The technology didn\'t exist yet. There were no manufacturers making it, so they had to design it all. The Garage is where Richard debuted all his newest innovations."', 'With these developments came a different kind of interaction, and it became clear that, as with Mancuso, systems often acted as an extension of the DJ, like a musician and their instrument.', '"There is a symbiotic relationship between the DJ and their system," says DePino, "Nicky Siano, at The Gallery, was bold, like his system. Larry was a product of both Siano and Mancuso. He wanted quality sound like the Loft, but his personality was big, and over the top, so the system reflected that too. You went to hear what Mancuso, Levan, and Siano wanted you to, not just what was on the radio, and they wanted you to hear it the way they thought it should be presented, through the systems they developed to do that."', 'It should be stated that while the much better-known Studio 54 often gets mentioned in the same breath as Paradise Garage in any "Golden Age of Disco" pieces, the two had very little in common, apart from opening at roughly the same time and having Richard Long and Associates systems. Incidentally, Alex Rosner almost got the bid, but inadvertently missed out because he wasn\'t willing to "discuss something" when his phone rang at 3 o\'clock one morning.', "In the image of the Loft's invite-only policy, Paradise Garage required a membership, to guarantee people had the right spirit and dedication, but the overarching philosophy was still squarely rooted in inclusiveness. The Garage wanted to avoid attention. DePino has many stories about efforts to keep it out of the press. 54, on the other hand, invited it.", 'Tim Lawrence explains, "Carmen D\'Alessio, who was hired early on to help shape Studio 54, had been to the Loft and initially attempted to introduce aspects of Mancuso\'s invite system. Meanwhile, [one of Studio 54\'s owners Steve] Rubell had been frequenting some downtown spaces, including the Gallery. Having sampled the musical and communal intensity of them he hoped to integrate aspects into Studio 54, and even hired Nicky Siano. However, there was ultimately little to connect it to downtown spaces such as the Loft and the Gallery."', 'In short time, Lawrence says, it "became a place renowned for its door queue, exclusionary entrance policies, and emphasis on celebrity culture," even though the person in charge of the door list had come up through the Loft.', 'As Siano told The Vinyl Factory, "I just cannot condone that kind of door policy, anywhere, anyhow, anyway, it\'s not right. [Mancuso] did invitations, the Paradise Garage did memberships. There was a way to do it without offending everyone who came and making them feel like shit. It was cool if you got in [to 54], but it was really fucked up if you were left outside all night," referring to the legions of people who lined up to get a glimpse of modern Rome that never had a chance of getting in.', '54 tried to recruit Levan, who decided they weren\'t "ready for him yet." Additionally, Rubell\'s policy was to specifically not focus on the DJ. In the many histories of Studio 54, the person who successfully kept the dance floor alive, Richie Kaczor, is rarely even mentioned. Siano and Rubell butted heads often during his short tenure, and was reputedly fired for, among other things, playing Kraftwerk\'s "Trans Europe Express." Both the song and Siano would go on to be massively influential.', 'At the Garage, aka "Gay Rage," Levan carried on the Loft tradition of making sure everything was just so for the evening\'s guests. No alcohol was served, and refreshments were included in the door fee. There\'s the legend of him stopping the music, getting a ladder and polishing the mirror ball. It\'s hard to fathom something like this happening at any of the glamor spots, but the patrons waited patiently, and even applauded when he was finished. He had absolute freedom, and used it to start blending instrumental versions of songs, remixing in the moment, one of many common practices that he pioneered.', 'It\'s a large part of the reason the 12" single exists at all. They contain multiple versions of a song, and have better fidelity, owing to not having to worry about groove width, but the cost per song, per pressing, was hard for some to justify. The success of Larry\'s version of "I Got My Mind Made Up" by Instant Funk changed that though. Fidelity, the system, the DJ, and what delighted a crowd all worked in concert to ultimately standardize a format. It represented even more changes from the Loft mentality, though, which steered clear of mixing, and played songs in their entirety.', 'Some people saw all of this as the next chapter being written, however "Mancuso believed that the system, while impressive, sacrificed certain aspects of musicality," says Lawrence. He also disliked that, by 1980, Fridays and Saturdays became "gay" and "mixed" nights, respectively. "David\'s view was, we\'re all human beings, why can\'t we dance together?"', "Levan's power was such that a song endorsement translated to sales. If he played a cut five times in a night it was guaranteed there would be a line at the record shops the next day, who often didn't even have it in stock, owing to its newness. Furthermore, the clubs and their systems influenced how the music that would eventually be played on them was produced.", "There are stories of Klipschorns and dancers being hauled into the studio to give it a club feel, and DJs created the tradition of the remix by becoming producers in the studio. Michael Brody's life partner, Mel Cheren, impresario of the genre-defining West End record label encouraged this. Levan showed an aptitude for it, and it became a new calling card for François Kevorkian, who had already spun records at the Loft, the Garage, and Studio 54. Many times these remixes were test-driven on club systems to see how they'd perform before they were pressed.", 'DePino often had to stand guard over Levan\'s DJ booth. "\'Can you get Larry to play this before we master it to know if the EQ is perfect?\' It didn\'t happen often at The Garage, because they had to get through me first. Even if they got to Larry he often wanted to hear it before he\'d play it in the club, unless they had his trust. If François came to him with something it would be the next record he played."', 'The practice continued, DePino says: "In the \'80s, when I was at Tracks, David Cole from C+C Music Factory would come to me in the middle of the night and go, \'I\'m working in the studio right now. I need to hear what this sounds like on a big system.\' I\'d play it, and he\'d go \'okay, thanks David!\' He\'d leave, and an hour later, he\'d come back and go, \'Can you play it again?\' It sounded completely different, because he re-EQ\'d it based on what he\'d heard."', 'Club culture would continue to explode, not only in New York, but around the world. Even as the \'80s rolled in and the well-documented disco backlash kicked into gear, the Garage continued to sow its cultural seeds. It maintained a reputation as a place that felt more "real" than most, with upcoming visual artists like Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat passing through, as well as new crops of people who wanted to dance to handpicked gems, even as AIDS devastated the gay community.', "It would eventually close in 1987, having drawn up the blueprint for essentially every dance club that would follow, giving birth to a genre, and setting the bar for what a DJ or club goer could consider a perfect night. David DePino worked and DJ'ed there for its entire existence.", "Alex Rosner still installs systems, though he's moved on to mainly kitting out churches. Fitting, as The Sanctuary's Steve D'Acquisto often compared early clubs to houses of worship. By the time of Richard Long's premature death, in 1986, he had installed over 300 systems around the world, most of them in Europe and South America.", '"From making the Loft system work to realizing Mancuso\'s ideas, like tweeter arrays that hang above the crowd, Alex\'s influence can\'t be overstated," says Bernabeu. "Their ideas, and the cabinets Richard designed, even shaped the way records would be produced and mixed, which launched a new style of music. In one way or another, though, it goes back to Alex. He is the father of sound-driven spaces."', "At 7 pm, in February of this year, on the 50th anniversary of the first Love Saves the Day party, I was in Midtown eating Szechuan with Charlotte von Kotze, who was imparting upon me all of the things the Loft stood for, how every person involved, from organizer to attendee, had a deep connection with music, and its impact on her colleagues at Brooklyn's Lot Radio. I learned about Barbie Bertisch and Paul Raffaele's Love Injection 'zine, Murphy's Lucky Cloud parties and Classic Album Sundays. How Douglas Sherman, Takaya Nagase, and Yuji K had modeled their Joy Collective in the Loft's tradition, and that Loft music compilations were released by Murphy and her mentor, Mancuso, on the Nuphonic label.", 'Fascinated by what I was hearing, I imagined a tribe of kind tastemakers, who use terms like "milieu" and "oeuvre" earnestly, dancing together, to the best music you\'ve never heard. She looked at her phone, looked back up at me and said, "Do you want to go?" We were in a cab 10 minutes later.', "Through a connect we had been added as member's guests with the understanding that we'd jibe with the rules. Charlotte had been to a few before, and answered any questions I had. Soon I found myself in a repurposed banquet hall. Having moved from 645 Broadway, to 99 Prince street, to the downsized Alphabet City locations, over half a century, it finally landed at the location we walked into, where it's been held longer than any other, though only a few times a year these days. There was no age limit, no dress code, a diverse mix of people, and the sound was phenomenal. I asked Murphy about it later.", 'She explained:', '"It\'s the simplest sonic path from the record, to the ear. No compression, pitch control, or EQ is used because of a commitment to the artist\'s original vision. It\'s a tricky system to play on, really, because there\'s no enhancement anywhere along the food chain. Originally he used Mitchell A. Cotter turntable bases with Fidelity Research FR-66 tonearms, and Koetsu cartridges. Now it starts with Technics SL110s with Koetsu tone arms, Koetsu Urushi cartridges, then the preamp is Mark Levinson ML-1, which is very simple and pure. There are Phono 1 and Phono 2 inputs, no mixer, because any additional equipment means more circuitry, which is a weak link. The amps are Class A Mark Levinson, then it goes to the Klipschorns."', 'I walked into the packed main room and politely eased my way to the center of the dancefloor for just a moment, so as not to disturb anyone who had got there first. As I admired the sound of the seven-speaker system, I looked up at a giant net full of balloons that would drop on the crowd much later in the evening. I remembered staring up at it, later, when Douglas Sherman told me the story about how his first job at the Loft, long before becoming a Musical Host, was to be in charge of the balloons, removing shrunken and deflated ones, because everyone pitches in to do needed jobs.', 'As I made my way back to the edge, through a sea of smiles and, more than likely, people I would eventually interview for this piece, the second thing I noticed was everyone could easily have conversations. I had plenty, throughout the night, with people from all walks of life, including some who have been regulars for 50 years. I met journalist Piotr Orlov, who summed it up for me later.', '"The entirety of the environment is important. The energy in the room flows between audience and DJ, and the soundsystem fits into that equation as the conduit. It did at places like Paradise Garage as well," he says. Then he quoted The Grateful Dead, with an academic tone in his voice, "You know, in a \'the music plays the band\' sense."', 'It reminded me of something Alex Rosner said, when asked about the absolute commitment to the simplest, highest quality signal path for environments like this: "Say you have five panes of glass, each one representing a component. If they are absolutely clean you can see through all of them. If even one pane is filthy the whole view is blocked." At the Loft, the attendees are the sixth pane of glass and there\'s not a speck of dust on it.', 'It took awhile for it to sink in what I\'d experienced. It all happened so fast that it\'s kind of a blur, but I left with the only impression that really matters: I had gone in with the common notion that dance spaces were mostly packed with vain people getting assaulted by over-hyped bass, to understanding the "oneness" aspect of it. François Kevorkian once commented on clubs that don\'t get this concept when he said, "They don\'t understand that it\'s the crowd that makes the venue, not the furniture." I hope to go to the Loft again, one day, so I can be more in the moment, and watch the Musical Hosts more carefully, observing Mancuso\'s influence.', 'DePino sums it up nicely: "One day, about 15 years ago, my phone rang and the journalist on the other end said, \'Oh my god am I speaking to David? You\'re a legend!\' David Morales would stay with me sometimes so I asked if that\'s who they were trying to reach. They said, \'No! DePino!\' I said, \'Look, there is only one legendary "David" I know and his last name is "Mancuso."\' He started this whole thing and there can only be one first domino."', "Author's note: I've barely scratched the surface, here. An entire essay could be devoted to how Judy Weinstein's record pool drove a lot of what happened in the '70s. There are deep dives into this era at redbullmusicacademy.com about the people mentioned, plus other key players like Steve D'Acquisto, Michael Cappello, Walter Gibbons, many of whom were Loft alum, and details on how Frankie Knuckles—who had DJ'ed with Levan at the Continental Baths—moved to Chicago to set up shop.", 'Shorty\'s site, sbsslammer.com, offers a detailed, inside look at the components used to design modern clubs. I highly recommend Tim Lawrence\'s books. Special thanks to Charlotte Von Kotze, the people quoted in this piece, who were beyond generous with their time, and especially Paul Rafaelle, who was the ultimate linchpin. As Piotr Orlov said about Paul\'s commitment to archiving, "He thrust himself into this stuff and the next thing you know he was in the middle of it, dragging it into the future. In that way he\'s the consummate New Yorker.

When Stevie Wonder released "Superstition"—the first single from 1972\'s Talking Book—the deep, churning, percussive sound driving the whole thing along came from an instrument unknown to most people at the time: the clavinet. In fact, it had already been around for years.', "But once the wider world picked up on it, the quirky little keyboard from Germany became the centerpiece of so many hard-grooving '70s tunes that the Soul Train logo should have been altered to incorporate the instrument's outline.", "The clavinet's '70s heyday wasn't only about R&B either. With its utterly unique combination of bottom-end bump and upper-register bite, the keyboard cut a powerful path through roots rock, prog, fusion, and plenty of other styles. But the story of the sound that helped define the '70s actually starts with 15th century classical music.", 'The clavichord was invented in the 1400s as sort a the little sibling of the harpsichord. Pressing the keys brought down blades that struck the metal strings inside the instrument.', "But the clavichord was created strictly for home use, with a volume level suitable only for the parlor, not the concert hall. So, in the long run, it didn't achieve the relative ubiquity of its louder counterpart.", "Fast-forward all the way to 1964. West German instrument makers Hohner—best-known by that time for their harmonicas and accordions—had been making electrified keyboards since the late '50s, including electric pianos like the Cembalet and Pianet, and the two-and-a-half octave bass keyboard the Basset.", "Within a couple of years, other companies would be making electric harpsichords, presumably responding to the baroque touches cropping up in pop and rock via the enterprising likes of The Beatles and The Beach Boys. But Hohner designer Ernst Zacharias beat them to the punch by basically slapping electric pickups onto the clavichord template and mutating that most fragile of classical instruments into a big, bold bruiser, ready for the rock 'n' roll age.", "Hohner's Clavinet I debuted in '64, followed the next year by the Clavinet II. It was initially marketed to both classical and pop musicians, but the former pretty much laughed it off, and it seems to have taken a couple of years to really pick up steam on the pop side.", 'The clavinet apparently didn\'t turn up on record until 1967. Its first appearance is generally reckoned to be "Let Go of You Girl" from the debut LP by New York baroque-pop pioneers The Left Banke, released in Feburary \'67.', 'But plenty more followed later that year, including The Lovin\' Spoonful\'s "6 O\'Clock," jazzer Don Ellis\'s "Indian Lady" from his Electric Bath album (played by Mike Lang), Emil Richards\' electronic lounge pop LP New Sound Element (played by Paul Beaver), and Jamaican rocksteady group The Termites\' "Attractive Girl."', 'In \'68, the clavinet started finding its way onto R&B records, like Booker T. & The M.G.\'s\' "The Beat Goes On" and Sam & Dave\'s "I Thank You."', 'Unsurprisingly (and most importantly), the most visionary R&B artiste of all began his love affair with the clavinet that year. It\'s all over Stevie Wonder\'s For Once in My Life album, on "Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Da Day" and "I Don\'t Know Why," but "You Met Your Match" is where he really digs into the funky, staccato low-end riffs that would come to define the instrument in the \'70s, largely thanks to his own subsequent work.', 'By this time, Hohner had already released the Clavinet C and the short-lived L, with its reverse-color keys and weirdly angled body. In 1969 rock \'n\' rollers really started ripping into the keyboard. On the underground end of the spectrum, budding clav virtuoso Terry Adams tears it up on NRBQ\'s "Stomp."', '"Terry Adams, my God, that guy can do anything with a clavinet," says power-pop cult hero Van Duren, "he makes it talk. Not to mention riding it all over the stage. He\'s the master as far as I\'m concerned. There are many NRBQ tunes that I have to listen to really closely to realize that it\'s not a guitar, it\'s a clavinet. It\'s amazing."', 'But Garth Hudson\'s crackling clavinet lines in The Band\'s "Up on Cripple Creek" marked the first time the instrument really turned the heads of young rockers in the musical mainstream.', '"The way The Band used it, there wasn\'t just a straight clavinet sound, it was treated," enthuses Duren. "On \'Cripple Creek,\' he\'s using the wah-wah pedal on it, which makes it sound almost like a Jew\'s Harp. And shortly thereafter [1970], "The Shape I\'m In," Richard Manuel played it through a phaser pedal or something. He got a great sound out of it too and I was really turned on by it. It just sounds like a clavinet underwater, it sounds really punchy and cool."', 'With instrumental hits like Billy Preston\'s "Outta Space" and Emerson, Lake & Palmer\'s "Nut Rocker," the new decade\'s first couple of years weren\'t lacking in clavinet spotlights. But it was in 1972, after having had a few years to really dig into the axe, that Stevie Wonder changed the game forever with "Superstition."', "In the world of the clavinet, the tune from Wonder's Talking Book album is the Mona Lisa, Arch de Triomphe, and Great Pyramid of Giza all rolled into one. Aside from the synth bass, drums, and horns, it's the only instrument on the track, and it's overdubbed multiple times.", 'The impossibly funky main riff would inspire untold legions of clavinet-wielding groove merchants for generations to come. And its chattering, sometimes guitar-like overdubbed siblings on the track opened our ears that much wider to the instrument\'s possibilities. Though "Superstition" employed a Clavinet C, Hohner had already introduced the D6 in \'71, which would become the standard-bearer for the line.', 'Only a tune as epochal as "Superstition" could steal the spotlight from Bill Withers\' "Use Me," released a few months ahead of Wonder\'s track, where Ray Jackson\'s indelible clavinet lick feels deliciously dirty in both the tonal and sexual sense.', 'Joe McGinty, best known for his work with The Psychedelic Furs and as ringmaster for New York City collective Loser\'s Lounge, is among the many keyboardists whose head was turned by the Talking Book track. "I remember when a friend picked up the Stevie Wonder album and put \'Superstition\' on," he says, "My friend was like, \'That\'s not a guitar, that\'s his keyboard,\' and [I remember] not knowing how a keyboard could make that sound."', 'It took Wonder to lead the way, but the clavinet really lent itself those funky staccato figures. "You have to approach it like a percussion instrument," says McGinty, "almost play it like a drummer. That\'s why Stevie Wonder, all his songs are in all the flat keys, because it\'s easier to attack those keys that way."', 'Journeyman Charly Roth, who has been a keyboardist for everybody from Suzanne Vega to Ozzy Osbourne, concurs. "There was no action, literally, you would put your finger down on the key and it would just go dink. That\'s why that funk style came up, because it just kind of enticed your hand to play like that. You would never think of playing anything like that on a Rhodes or a Hammond. It was literally where the instrument led you to play."', 'When former Temptations singer Eddie Kendricks scored a huge hit less than a year after "Superstition" with the clavinet workout "Keep on Truckin\'," it was clear the funky keyboard was a full-blown phenomenon.', '"When you started hearing these funk records," recalls Roth, "it really became \'We\'re gonna put this instrument up front.\' \'Keep on Truckin\'\' to me is still the clavinet song of all time, it really puts the instrument through it\'s paces of the different ways it could be expressive as a featured instrument, but also the unbelievable range it has as a comping instrument."', 'But even while it was becoming the keyboard du jour for funkmeisters, the clav found plenty of fans in the rock camp in the first half of the \'70s. Most famously, John Paul Jones tore into it on Led Zeppelin\'s "Trampled Underfoot," The Edgar Winter Group took it for a "Free Ride," and Grand Funk harnessed its power for their hits "The Loco-Motion" and "Bad Time." But Todd Rundgren\'s guitar-like use of the instrument represented an entirely different aspect of its sonic personality.', '"Once you plug it through a very slow-moving not too heavily regurgitated flanger and a distortion box," says Roth, "it essentially becomes an electric guitar through an amp. The sort of runs you can do also lend itself very well to become an accompanying instrument for electric guitar. Rundgren, it\'s all over his records, but he uses it in a very different way. He basically uses it as a thing that could achieve a guitar-like tone but you could play keyboard voicings on it."', 'In 1975, Van Duren and Big Star\'s Jody Stephens laid down a batch of demos at Memphis\'s now-legendary Ardent Studio, which began the long path to Duren\'s cult-classic debut, Are You Serious. "I used the Ardent clavinet," he remembers, "a 1960s Clavinet C, which they still have.', 'By then I\'d heard Stevie Wonder and his application of it, which is more like a lead instrument. And Rundgren\'s, the way he used it in recordings, which is a lot of times doubling the piano. Which is what I ended up doing just to give it a different texture. It\'s like a keyboard guitar in a lot of ways."', 'By the time the \'80s rolled around, though, the clavinet was in decline. "It was heavy, it was expensive, and you had to store it somewhere," says Roth. Evolving synthesizer technology also contributed to the instrument\'s endangerment. "The same musical space the clavinet would have taken up was now being taken up by these analog stabby synth pads and these tight little \'80s chordings. Even something like the [Yamaha] DX7 had such a fast attack time that clavinet sounds were fairly easy to do on it."', 'When more sophisticated digital synths like Roland\'s D-50 and the Korg M-1 arrived in the late \'80s the clavinet might as well have been on the AARP mailing list. "Not only did the sound of that instrument fall out of style for a while," sums up Roth, "but it did it at exactly the same time when another technology could approximate it enough where the real instrument wasn\'t needed."', 'These days the clavinet\'s rarity rivals that of the Sumatran rhinoceros, especially onstage. "Nowadays all your gig keyboards like the Nord [Electro and Stage] or the Yamaha Motif, they all have pretty convincing clavinets" says Joe McGinty.', '"I haven\'t used an actual real clavinet probably since the late \'70s" affirms Van Duren. "In a live context you\'re using one or two keyboards, and if you can get that sound just by switching patches, that\'s far more convenient. When I got to using synths in the early \'80s and on, every one I owned had a great clavinet sound."', 'But as any analog devotee will tell you, as close as digital approximations may come, there\'s nothing like the real thing. Onstage substitutes aside, McGinty still keeps a clav in his studio setup. "There are some synthesizer patches that are pretty close but they\'re really not the same," he says, "they\'re kind of their own thing. Close enough for live. It\'s definitely better in the studio to have the real thing… you can change the pickup combination and things like that." Duren agrees, "The real thing sounds better as long as you know how to record it properly."', 'The clavinet still sounds as good today as it did when keyboardists like Wonder and Winter were flailing away at it in the \'70s. "It\'s a distinct sound," agrees McGinty, "you can cut through really well. It\'s very satisfying and a lot of fun. When you dig into it you can really feel it, it\'s definitely a very tactile and direct instrument. It\'s like a percussion instrument, you can really just whack it [laughs], it\'ll sound great."', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Others move throughout space. Rotary effects check both boxes. The vibe, warble, and spin of rotary effects have inspired sounds across genres, from down-home country sets to the stage of Woodstock. While rotary effects generally fit in the big bucket category of modulation sounds, they have a history all their own and relate to some iconic effects that have been cloned and reimagined in a variety of formats.', 'To understand the ongoing history of rotary pedals, however, means getting a sense of the effect’s bigger heritage. Much bigger.', 'Apart from that synth-hipster friend we all have, few normal people are thinking of plugging an organ into their pedalboard. Yet, not unlike the later Roland CE-2 Chorus geared toward keyboards but received among guitarists, the Leslie Cabinet was designed with organists in mind. It wasn’t until later that the sound was paired with the six string. So where did the idea come from and how did the item work? Meet Donald Leslie.', 'Donald Leslie perched upon the seat of his home organ in the 1930s pondering how to develop a sound that could match the cavernous chimes and tone of cathedral organs. If physical space was the problem, perhaps optimizing air was the solution. The feat of physics Leslie worked towards came to form in an effect as big as the organ itself, affectionately known as the Leslie Cabinet.', 'Picture a speaker box the size of your fridge. Inside there’s a downward-facing bass speaker within a drum. Up top are a spinning set of horns belting out the upper range frequencies. The player could then control the pace and pulse of these sounds by altering the speed of acceleration or deceleration. Where the magic happens is when these are out of sync, offering unexpected but unforgettable sounds that you not only hear but feel.', 'The Leslie Cabinet turned out to be a tough sell. Hammond Organs, the powerhouse brand of the day, turned down the design. Without the backing of a brand partner, Leslie went solo and founded Electro-Music. In 1941, the company released the Leslie Cabinet, which, while accepted by some organists, found unexpected acceptance with guitarists in the decades ahead. It also caught the interest of a prospective buyer.', 'Fast-forward to 1965. With the fame of the Leslie Cabinet crescendoing and the music biz changing, Electro-Music found itself scooped up by the media giant CBS. While CBS didn’t do much with Electro-Music itself, they eventually channeled the idea of the Leslie Cabinet into production under the name of another company they acquired: Fender.', 'Since guitarists had taken to DIY mods to make the Leslie usable with the six string for some time, Fender released its own massive rotary masterpiece: the Vibratone. Though inspired by the Leslie, the Vibratone achieved its rotary sound from a different angle, literally.', 'The design was essentially an oversized guitar cabinet. In front of the speaker, however, was a styrofoam disc with holes in it. When the disc spun, sound escaped the holes in rotation, offering up a warm hypnotic tone. Though a cult classic now, the most famous use of the effect is found on the track “Cold Shot” by Stevie Ray Vaughan.', 'Over the years, other companies have offered their take on full-form rotary speaker cabinets. More notable entries include the Maestro Rover R0-1 or Yamaha RA-50 and RA-100. But let’s face it, cabinet-based rotary units are hardly economical and ridiculous real estate hogs. If any effect was destined for a compact pedal, it’s this one.', 'Japanese pedal maker Shin-ei recognized this prospect in the 1960s and sought a solution in circuitry. While the magic of a Leslie was in moving air, Shin-ei developed a circuit that used photocells (think light and wires fused with fairy dust) to create an organic modulating wave effect. The result was the iconic Uni-Vibe.', 'The Uni-Vibe not only scaled down on the Leslie’s form factor but produced a modulation sound that spawned its own typology. While the original effect had a switch between chorus and vibrato, in reality the pedal was neither. This mislabelling, however, didn’t stall the effect’s rise to success. The most famous uses are arguably performances by Jimi Hendrix in “Machine Gun” or David Gilmour in “Breathe.”', 'With Shin-ei proving that even the largest effect could be placed underfoot, both big brand and boutique pedal makers over the years have drawn upon and extended the heritage of rotary sounds.', 'On the Leslie-esque side of things, pedal technology meant new ways of capturing and controlling the variable speeds and oscillating pulses of the speakers.', 'For example, the suite of Vent pedals by Neo Instruments, Strymon Lex, and Electro-Harmonix Lester pedals all allow for on the fly shifts in speeds that ramp up or rev down. These all also recreate the natural gain and compression profile of the Leslie’s preamp, giving your warble pedal a bit of gritty warmth.', 'The Fender Vibratone laid dormant in the company’s catalogue with few if any pedal versions until the recent release of the Fender Pinwheel. This stompbox offers some similar functionality to others on the market—speed, ramp, drive—but stands out for its tailored emulation of three different rotary effect voicings. One of them, of course, models the classic Vibratone. Spinning styrofoam wheel not included.', 'When it came to the classic Shin-ei design, the vibey sounds of the original resulted in both part-for-part clones and out of this world reimaginations. Arguably the most famous clone turned classic in its own right is the Fulltone Deja-Vibe, which nails the mojo of the resistance characters of the original Uni-Vibe like none other.', 'JHS Pedals also refined the design of the LED pulse circuit in their Unicorn pedal yet, by some mix of magic and innovation, added tap tempo functionality and sub-divisions to bring the vibe into this century.', 'Effects nerds will ex-communicate each other for confusing rotary speaker effects with vibe pedals. Now you know better. Yet, as with any effect debate, there’s a big backstory. In the case of rotary cabinet’s, that story looms larger than any other effect.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

I\'d get endorsements and take photos for the advertisements. After college, I worked at Modulus Graphite guitars in San Francisco for a while, and then moved to New York City to work for a sales firm who taught me the ropes on the East Coast. I earned an MBA at the University of Denver and officially joined the family business.', '"At St. Louis Music, my passion was working with artists, and I took on all the Artist Relations for Ampeg, Alvarez, and Crate. Some of my favorite relationships were with Crosby Stills & Nash, Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir of Grateful Dead, John Denver, INXS, and Johnny Cash. Soon, though, I was like: \'I\'m working for my father now?\' Everyone looked at me as the owner\'s son, which was not the easy experience that some people think a family business provides. My father, Gene, had grown St. Louis Music massively, but passing on a multi-generational business has its issues and risks for all involved. So we sold the company, and after a few years of being retained by the new owners, I parted ways.', '"It was probably in 2007 that I came upon Magnatone as I looked through some old St. Louis Music brochures. I went on eBay and started buying back vintage Magnatone stuff, a sort of archaeological study on the history of this forgotten brand. I found Magnatone nickel-operated radios made for motels, monoblock tube amps and preamps, uranium detector kits, portable tube record players, and all with an incredibly cool vibe. I now have maybe 500 individual Magnatone items, right back to the very beginning in 1937 in Los Angeles—including quite a few amplifiers, lap steels, and electric guitars. And I figured there was an opportunity here to go out on my own."', '"When I realized there was such a thing as Magnatone, I went online to the Trademark section of the United States Patent and Trademark Office and typed in \'Magnatone.\' There was a hearing-aid company called Magnatone, but Magnatone as in amplifiers came up as expired. I couldn\'t believe it! The brand had disappeared around 1969.', '"If a brand has lapsed, you can register it, and then it goes through a number of processes. You have to make a product and ship it out of state and have a sale receipt, which I guess shows interstate commerce. Then you have to register it in the classes you need, and because I wasn\'t only interested in guitar amps, I registered Magnatone in everything! Clothing, watches, hats—everything.', '"There was one conflict. There was a label called Magnatone Records, and that was music-related. So I wrote a humble little letter to Curb Records out of Nashville, who owned the name, told them about my family connection, that I wanted to resurrect this brand and do it justice. The owner wrote back and said I was more than welcome to use it in every category except for recorded music. I submitted his letter, and it went through.', '"That\'s the legal side, and anyone can do a brand resurrection like that. Billy Gibbons was one of the first people I told that I now owned Magnatone. Another was Neil Young, who uses an old 280 stereo model. About a year or two into it, when Billy saw I\'d made it a success, he said how impressed he was with me. A lot of people bring him ideas, say he should do this or that, but very few people actually go and do them, and then follow through. Billy said to me: \'Ted, you don\'t quit.\'"', '"I knew that if I brought back the Magnatone brand and was only making guitar amplifiers, that\'s a relatively small market, dominated by legendary brands. So we had to have some differentiating thing about Magnatone. And we do: We have real pitch-shifting vibrato, and we want it to be the definitive benchmark. We still use varistors made of silicon carbide for vibrato in our mono and stereo models. That\'s what Magnatone used originally to stabilize the image on old television sets in the \'50s, and for us it was the most important thing to keep identical to our patented circuit.', '"I saw Neil Young\'s guitar tech, Larry Cragg, who I\'ve known all my life, told him I now owned Magnatone. He said he\'d help me and give his input—and he\'s still intricately involved in the sound of our amplifiers today. Anyway, at the start he said, \'I gotta tell you, Ted, Magnatones had great stereo vibrato, but they weren\'t great-sounding amps compared to \'50s Fenders. They were a nightmare to work on and repair, and they were not roadworthy. If you\'re gonna do it, you\'ve gotta make \'em better!\' So when people ask me what\'s different about the new amps, I just say: \'They\'re better!\'', '"They\'re all handwired, but we don\'t point-to-point every little wire. We had custom eyelet boards made, so every part has a home—especially needed for the vibrato circuit, which takes up quite some space inside the chassis. All our cabinets are made of solid pine or Baltic Birch, and they\'re all finger-jointed. We use leather handles made by the Amish in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. We replicated the chevrons on the spun fiberglass grille cloth—one for a mono amp, two for stereo—and plated them with 14-carat gold. Most importantly, I set out to manufacture in America, because I\'m very much in favor of making products like Magnatone with American parts, work ethic, and pride."', '"I began to put a dream team of engineers together—and currently that\'s Obeid Khan, who runs engineering, Dave Ryan and Diane Villani, who are master builders, Brian Harvey, who does final assembly, and Chris Villani, who runs production and operations—plus Rod Washburn, who manages our business and our worldwide sales.', '"I wanted to have product development and R&D done before we came to market, and when we finally showed at NAMM for the first time, in 2013, I didn\'t tell a soul. I didn\'t invite one dealer to our booth, didn\'t make any press releases. I wanted to shock, and one company in particular was shocked—Gibson. They came down to my booth and said they were showing Scotty Moore\'s Magnatone amp at their booth, and they had no idea we were going to bring Magnatone back.', '"From my perspective, the Magnatone brand had been frozen, and I wanted to thaw it over time. The worst thing when you bring something new to the market is to overhype it. And one of the worst things to do is to say our amp is better than some competitor. There\'s only seven or eight amplifier brands in the history of the world that matter. And that\'s it. We all know who they are.', '"I always tell people the same thing, which is that when a company is in business for 50 years or 100 years, consistently, it\'s tough not to take side roads and make mistakes. Everyone does, because they need to make lower price points or they need to increase their capacity. But really, I wanted to learn what their mistakes were and not repeat them."', '"Billy Gibbons remembered the \'50s brown Magnatone amps and was really not a big fan of their aesthetics—and anyway, he wanted an amp to have a master volume feature. I thought OK, he\'s a Marshall guy—that\'s the holy grail of British tone. Then I went to see Neil Young, and he was all about the brown Magnatone era and the Buddy Holly model 280—he still uses one today, along with a couple of our new Twilighters.', '"So Billy didn\'t really want to discuss anything about the brown amps and their sound. He wanted me to \'retain the gain or feel the pain,\' which is exactly what he said. Neil didn\'t have any interest in going after the Marshall sound. He wanted to get power tube distortion and turn it up loud. And Billy was like, \'Well, I don\'t play loud.\'', '"I thought OK, why don\'t we just make two different collections of models and please them both? And since I\'m not a fan of channel-switching amps in general, we separated the new Magnatones at birth, so to speak, into our Traditional Collection and our Master Collection. One has master volume, the other doesn\'t.', '"I made a vow that I would not give any Magnatone amplifiers away for free. We don\'t to this day. If a musician won\'t pay for it, that means they really don\'t need it. \'One listen is worth a thousand words,\' is what Larry Cragg says. You\'ve just got to plug it in and listen to it."', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music. He is a co-founder of Backbeat UK and Jawbone Press.

And, chances are, the first several your brain conjures were released in the 1980s.', 'With the release of the big polyphonic synths like the Yamaha CS-80 and Oberheim OB-8 in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s and, later, the arrival of MIDI and sampling, the ‘80s were a golden age for synthesizer soundtracks. This was as true for horror and action as it was for science fiction. Blade Runner, anyone?', "While horror synthesizer soundtracks really took off in the late ‘70s, thanks to the pioneering work of director/composer John Carpenter and Goblin (the prog-rock band responsible for the soundtracks of many Italian gore-fests of the disco area, like 1977's Suspiria), synth-spiced sci-fi soundtracks are a little harder to come by.", 'But they do exist, and below, we’re taking a look at the synthesizers used in six 1970s sci-fi films.', "John Carpenter’s first film was 1974’s Dark Star, a spoof of 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey, co-written and starring Dan O’Bannon—who later went on to write another sci-fi film about an alien loose in the corridors of an interstellar freighter. Of course, John Carpenter would go on to make his own lasting waves in the film business, helping to popularize the use of synthesizers in soundtracks along the way.", 'The son of a musician, Carpenter composed many of his own scores, Dark Star included. The score prominently featured an EMS VCS3—a portable modular synth first introduced in 1969 and used by Pink Floyd, Pete Townshend, Hawkwind, and many others.', 'Always budget-conscious, Carpenter borrowed a VCS3 and recorded the entire soundtrack in around four hours. “It was an ability for one person—me—who’s cheap, to sound bigger than he actually is,” Carpenter told Vice in 2014. “To double, triple, and quadruple track these sounds. So that’s why I did it.”', 'His use of a VCS3 also references classic 1950s sci-fi films like Forbidden Planet (1956)—which used primitive electronics in its soundtrack—and The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951), which employed theremins and tape effects to evoke dread and a feeling of “the other.”', "Carpenter was going for something more light-hearted with Dark Star, though he would go on to write and record one of the scariest film themes ever written just a few years later—1978's Halloween.", 'Jerry Goldsmith was a prolific film and television soundtrack composer who was equally at home with synthesizers as with orchestras. His soundtrack for Logan’s Run was a perfect example of this. The 1976 film—about a dystopian, hedonistic culture where people are ritualistically killed when they turn 30—featured a score that alternated between synthesized and orchestral sections to contrast the artificiality of the enclosed city where everyone lived with the freedom of the natural world outside.', 'To achieve this tone, Goldsmith used an ARP 2500—which was first released in 1970, when the company was still called Tonus. A true beast of a modular system, it used a 10x10 pin matrix instead of patch cables (not unlike the VCS3) to connect its various modules.', 'The city parts of the film feature some incredible modular workouts. With its clangorous tones and cascading sequences, the 2500 here sounds almost Buchla-like and would not have been out of place on a Nonesuch release of the time. Goldsmith was also known to use an ARP 2600, the semi-modular follow-up to the 2500, and has stated that it was used on the Logan’s Run score as well.', 'From the application of percussion in The Planet Of The Apes to the use of the blaster beam in Star Trek: The Motion Picture to his blending of synthesizers with traditional orchestral passages in Damnation Alley, Goldsmith was never afraid of straying into avant-garde territory in his work.', 'Released three years after 2001: A Space Odyssey, Stanley Kubrick’s groundbreaking 1971 dystopian sci-fi film, A Clockwork Orange, shocked viewers with its graphic depictions of teenage hooligans on the loose in a dilapidated near-future. Also shocking to audiences of the time was the synthesized soundtrack, realized by Wendy Carlos, who again used her Moog modular system to bring the classical world into the electronic.', 'While her new versions of Henry Purcell, Gioachina Rossini, and Ludwig Van Beethoven weren’t so far removed from her wildly successful first studio album, Switched-On Bach, it was the Vocoder used in “March From A Clockwork Orange" (an excerpt of the 4th movement from Beethoven’s 9th Symphony) that was really novel.', 'On her website, Carlos writes about making the piece, saying, "At that time it was all unexplored territory, we were the first audacious (or just plain silly) enough to attempt this. Many have followed, so it must have been a decent idea." Remember, this is likely the first time anyone had ever heard a Vocoder before.', 'Although Moog would eventually release its 16-band Vocoder in 1979 (and then re-release it in 2020), at this time, Carlos was using one that had been custom-made for her by Bob Moog himself. A 10-band version, it utilized her modular system to act as the carrier, with her and her musical partner Rachel Elkind providing the vocal modulator.', 'With only 10 bands, it produced a haunting, fairly artificial sound—one that must have been shocking to ears unaccustomed to the idea of a singing synthesizer. Indeed, Kubrick hired Carlos based on this piece and the more avant-garde “Timesteps,” which she made to take advantage of the novelty of the Vocoder.', 'While “March” may sound quaint today, in our modern world of autotune and extreme vocal processing, it was a monumental leap forward in technology and creative expression at the time of its release.', 'A common thread that runs throughout most synth-heavy 1970s soundtracks is in how the synths were used. While the 1980s saw synthesizers spread into almost all genres of music, they were still very much brand-new in the 1970s.', 'Capable of producing a vast range of tones and timbres that had never been heard before, they sounded strange and alien to most every listener used to a palette of acoustic instruments. Composers exploited this quality, particularly in sci-fi soundtracks, where they were often used in contrast to more familiar and comforting symphonic sounds.', 'Andrei Tarkovsky’s Solaris, shot in the Soviet Union in 1972, is the story of a man sent to investigate the breakdown of a space station orbiting a strange planet. While on home Earth, we hear the music of Bach. But in the alien world of Solaris, the music we hear is made by the ANS synthesizer.', 'Built by Evgeny Murzin over the course of 20 years, from 1937 to 1957, the ANS synthesizer is a "photoelectronic" synth that uses the technique of photo-optic sound to produce music with light. The operator draws on a glass plate covered with a kind of black resin. As the plate is tracked from left to right, sound is produced. Played by composer Eduard Artemiev on the Solaris soundtrack, it generated haunting and unique sounds, perfect to represent the enigma of the possibly conscious water planet.', 'Unfortunately, there is only one ANS synthesizer in existence in the world. It has been used famously by Coil (on their album ANS) and by TGAC. For those of us unable to travel to Russia for time with the original, you can give the ANS synthesizer virtual simulation a try.', 'Phase IV, a 1974 sci-fi film about ultra-intelligent ants, is perhaps the ultimate midnight film. The one and only direction credit for Saul Bass, the famous graphic designer and film title artist, it’s a heady film that is both fiercely psychedelic and vehemently intelligent, with an incredible soundtrack to boot.', 'Composed by Brain Gascoigne with help from David Vorhaus (of cult electronic group White Noise), BBC Radiophonic Workshop member Desmond Briscoe, and Japanese percussionist Stomu Yamash’ta, the soundtrack veers from Ummagumma-era Pink Floyd-style bombast to deep, menacing synthesizer drones.', 'While there’s precious little information available on what gear was used in the making of the soundtrack, the drones are very VCS3-like, and sound remarkably similar to the kinds of VCS3 soundscapes Vorhaus was exploring on his White Noise 2 album, which was released the same year as the film. The soundtrack also features what sounds like traditional orchestral strings run through a filter—much like Brian Eno did with Robert Fripp’s guitar on David Bowie’s "Heroes." The squealing, biting resonance peak in these orchestral passages sounds very EMS VCS3-like.', 'Gascoigne, who went on to score The Emerald Forest (1985) and play on The Dark Crystal, was a known ARP 2600 user, so there may also be some of ARP’s famous synthesizer floating around this soupy, psychedelic soundtrack as well.', 'And so we come to 1977’s Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, featuring perhaps the most famous use of a synthesizer in a sci-fi film, or indeed any film. But unfortunately for synthesizer fanatics, there’s actually precious little synthesizer played in the movie.', "The story goes that director Steven Spielberg bought an ARP 2500 to use in the film to communicate with the alien ships at Devil’s Tower. The film's production team asked someone to come along to help set it up, so ARP sent Phil Dodds, who was the company's vice president of engineering at the time.", 'Apparently, Spielberg thought Dodds looked the part and asked Dodds to appear in the film as the synthesizer operator. Dodds plays the famous five tones to “speak” with the alien ships and then looks on in awe as the aliens take over the synth from a distance for the famous conversation scene (called “Wild Signals” on the soundtrack).', 'A great synthesizer movie story for sure, but unfortunately, that’s not an ARP 2500 on the soundtrack. In fact, it’s not even a synthesizer. While we do hear some of the synth in the film, the soundtrack—as written by composer John Williams—features clarinet for the “synthesizer” part and tuba for the ship. Williams had apparently considered using a Moog originally, but found the sound too alien. Go figure!', 'For more on ARP and its connection to Close Encounters, we recommend reading our tribute to the ARP 2500 and watching Alex Ball’s great documentary on the company.', 'About the author: Adam Douglas is a musician and synthesizer fan based in Tokyo, Japan.

She creates one-woman guitar soundscapes as Noveller and has appeared with Iggy Pop, in his arthouse mood on last year\'s Free album. "The bow has influenced the type of guitar that I play and how I approach composing," she says, "and it seems to make its way into almost every piece of music I write."', 'Talk of playing guitar with a bow will cause music fans of a certain temperament to think immediately of Jimmy Page, on stage in his pomp with Led Zeppelin, bow in hand, Les Paul slung low. But Mr. Page was not the first to consider the potential for taking an apparently simple piece of classical kit to a willing electric guitar.', "That honor goes to Eddie Phillips of The Mark Four. In the mid-'60s, Eddie was looking for a way to keep a drone going on his low E-string while he hammered-on a solo with his left hand on the other strings.", 'First, he tried sawing a string with a hacksaw from which he\'d removed the blade and added a taut guitar string. That seemed pretty good, until at one gig he noticed some kids in the front row pointing at his guitar and laughing. "I looked down, and I\'d worn three or four massive grooves in the bottom horn of my 335 from the ends of the saw," Eddie tells me. "Oh no! What have I done? So that obviously wasn\'t going to work."', "Next, he went to his local music store in northeast London, bought a violin bow, and tried that. Not great. Jack Jones, the Mark Four drummer, said he'd heard you had to put rosin on the bow. Eddie went straight back to the store for a block of solid orange stuff with a whiff of pine.", 'Once a bow is treated to some of this rosin, it has the right amount of "grip" for the strings, as Eddie discovered. "I tried it, and to my surprise it actually worked," he says. "OK, it didn\'t do the guitar a great deal of good—but it didn\'t wreck it like the hacksaw. It did the job. And then I found you could turn the bow over to play it almost like a bottleneck, if you could get it right. It was all hit and miss. It was the kind of thing where one night it would be great, and the next night you gave up on it."', 'On stage, The Mark Four played an extended version of Bo Diddley\'s "Mona," where John Dalton (later of The Kinks) would put down his bass and get on the drums with Jack to belt out the Bo Diddley rhythm. "That was a really great platform to do the bow work," Eddie says, "because Spud, the rhythm guitarist, would just bash away on the chord, and there was nothing in the way for my bowed guitar. It would really cut through."', "A guitar is not a violin, you'll be surprised to hear. So the absence of a violin's arched bridge means a guitarist with a bow who wants to play single notes is usually limited to the outer two strings, but double-stops and chords are available with a bit of practice, as Eddie discovered.", '"Yes, I\'d use it for chords, too, all the strings—I\'d play rhythmic patterns with the bow on the strings," he recalls. "I loved to do things like that on guitar that weren\'t normally done. People were still happy to play guitars in the normal way, which is OK, but I was always trying to do something a little bit different. It all added to our reputation as being this slightly off-the-wall band."', 'The Mark Four morphed into The Creation and signed to Planet, a label Shel Talmy set up after parting company with The Who following a disagreement. Eddie continued to use his bow, often in combination with his notable use of feedback, as on the 1966 Creation single "Making Time."', '"We came out of that mid-\'60s mod raving explosion on the London scene, just a mad, mad time," Eddie says. "When I picked up the bow, you\'d see the audience thinking oh, what\'s going on here? And you\'ll notice now in the online videos of the band that I removed the pickguard from my 335, because I had to make room for that downward stroke of the bow. Anyway, it was all part of this big fantastic thing that was going on. I tried to give it what I thought it needed."', 'The Creation never quite earned the fame they deserved, but it seems Jimmy Page certainly noticed Eddie\'s application of the violin bow to the electric guitar. The first recorded evidence of Jimmy using a bow comes with the brief solo on "Tinker Tailor Soldier Sailor," a July \'67 Yardbirds B-side (and also a track on the Little Games album).', 'The bow became a more important fixture with Jimmy\'s next band, however, the mighty Zeppelin. Following the sessions for their first album that included his use of bow and Telecaster in"Dazed And Confused" and "How Many More Times," he told Melody Maker: "I use an ordinary violin bow on the guitar, given a little more tension on the horsehair than one would employ for violin playing, plus lots more rosin. It gives an infinite variety of sounds, ranging from violin to cello and from a whistling wind to a Boeing 707 taking off."', 'When Jimmy picked up the bow on stage, it certainly provided visual drama, and "Dazed And Confused" provided a live showcase for the style, as seen in the footage of the band at London\'s Albert Hall in the opening weeks of 1970. Jimmy was nonetheless keen to underline the musical importance of the technique. "When I use a violin bow on guitar it\'s not just a gimmick, like people think," he told Chris Welch at the time. "It\'s because some great sounds come out. You can employ legitimate bowing techniques and gain new scope and depth."', "Other guitarists have since dipped into the scope and depth offered by a bowed guitar, including Colin Muinzer of Cruella de Ville and Jónsi of Sigur Rós. Nigel Tufnel of Spinal Tap ditched the bow and used the violin to scrape his strings, but that's not widely recommended.", 'Sarah Lipstate uses a bow for some of her Noveller solo work, and following Noveller\'s 2015 album Fantastic Planet she was invited to tour as part of Iggy Pop\'s band. "I\'m proud of my bowed guitar work on the track \'Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night\' that I wrote for Iggy," she tells me. "I\'d stumbled on the idea of a violin bow back when I was living in Austin for college. A friend had given me an eBow my freshman year. His uncle had given it to him and he thought it was boring, so he gave it to me."', 'The eBow is a small handheld device for guitar, originally introduced in the \'70s, that electronically induces string vibrations, potentially creating endless sustain. Sarah experimented with it, making four-track recordings of layered guitars. "So the next year, when I was browsing a vintage guitar shop and saw a violin bow hanging on the wall, I got really excited about the idea of creating that sustained eBow sound using the real thing."', 'Any tips for budding bow users? "Use rosin on your bow," she says with a smile. "I use a carbon fiber cello bow now, and it works really well for me. I wrecked so many bows in college by accidentally leaving them in the car. The Texas heat will warp a wooden bow in a heartbeat. I also lost a wooden bow after it was swept off a music stand by the tail of a giant T.Rex puppet. Carbon fiber is more durable!"', 'The guitar\'s body shape is a big consideration, Sarah says. "Offset guitars bow really well for me because I primarily bow the high E-string. For that reason, I find it\'s almost impossible to bow a Strat. My Jazzmaster is the perfect body shape for accessing notes high up on the neck where I tend to do most of my bowing. There\'s always rosin residue around the 19th fret of my Jazzmaster."', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

This tape would later be pressed to vinyl and distributed by Bozo Meko—a bootleg label run by BreakBeat Lenny and BreakBeat Lou, the team behind the foundational Ultimate Breaks and Beats compilation album series.', 'With “Fusion Beats” on the B-side—an early cut-up/sampling tape experiment produced by Afrika Islam and Jazzy Jay of the Universral Zulu Naton—the Flash to the Beat 12-inch is one of the most important documents of early hip-hop history.', 'While Flash does begin the performance by playing classic breaks like Juice’s “Catch A Groove," Flash to the Beat is unique for its time because, instead of backing the Furious Five on the turntables, Flash performs beats live using a Vox Percussion King v829. With its initial release in 1966, the Vox Percussion King was already a "vintage" machine by the time Flash got his hands on it.', 'An ad from the Thomas Vox (US) company gives us an insight into some of the Percussion King’s features and design specs:', '', '', 'With Flash’s funky kick and snare pattern and the Furious Five’s catchy rapped/sung routine, Flash to the Beat became a classic that has been sampled in countless hip-hop tunes. Most famously, it was used for the drums in Gang Starr’s “You Know My Steez” and has been sampled by The Beastie Boys and DJ Shadow.', 'In 1982, a group of New York-based musicians, who had come together to serve as Kurtis Blow’s touring band, released “Action"—a slick and catchy pop-funk anthem that ruled clubs and boomboxes that year. Although the song was a hit and has continued to live on in DJ sets since its release, “Action” has found an unlikely second life as the inspiration behind one of the greatest rap songs ever made.', 'Producer Larry Smith played bass on “Action,” and it was through his relationship with Russell Simmons (Kurtis Blow’s manager) that Smith would find himself in the studio with Hollis Queens trio RUN-D.M.C. In contrast to the first wave of rap releases, which had backing tracks mostly made up of interpolations of disco cuts played by live musicians, "Sucker M.C.\'s" was a strikingly rough and minimal production.', 'The song only featured the group\'s voice and reverb-heavy recreation of Orange Krush drummer Trevor Gale\'s drum beat from "Action." Programmed on the Oberheim DMX and produced by Larry Smith, “Sucker M.C.\'s” represented a sea-change in the way that rap records were produced.', '"[Smith] was just messing around with the drum machine and replayed Trevor’s beat," says writer and historian Jay Quan (of thaFoundation.com). "He called the beat \'The Krush Groove\' before it was renamed \'Sucker M.C.\'s\'."', 'Quan also spoke about Smith\'s ability to nail the raw sound RUN-D.M.C. was going for, being an instrumentalist who\'d emerged from the soul/funk era. "That was the genius of Larry. He used to hang out at The Fever (a legendary Bronx nightclub where RUN-D.M.C. got their start) and he witnessed Flash, June Bug, etc. He understood hip-hop."', 'In the late 1970s, multi-instrumentalist and programmer Roger Linn was working out of a small, four-track studio in his home. Armed with a Fender Rhodes electric piano, a guitar, and a bass, Linn was in search of a solution for creating realistic drum tracks for the demos he was producing.', 'Increasingly dissatisfied with the inflexibility and sound-quality of the few drum machines that were on the market at the time, Linn set about creating his own drum machine—one that was both programmable (as opposed to earlier machines that just played preset beats) and featured sounds that were sampled, lending to a more realistic sound. And in 1979, the Linn LM-1 Drum Computer was released to a hungry market.', "Musicians and producers alike quickly embraced Linn’s machines, and by 1982, Linn Electronics followed up its LM-1 with the LinnDrum—a machine that was cheaper and more accessible than the LM-1 and would eventually go on to provide rhythm tracks for many '80s hits.", 'One act that used the LinnDrum to help craft one of their better-known recordings was the Philly-based rap duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince. Known for their light-hearted and accessible take on rap, Jazzy Jeff & the the Fresh Prince’s sound broke from that of many of their peers by incorporating beatboxer Ready Rock C alongside samples, programmed beats, and Jeff’s virtuosic scratching.', "Their classic 1988 album He’s The DJ, I’m The Rapper was partially recorded in Battery Studios' state-of-the art facilities in London and featured the Roland TR-808, the Synclavier, and the LinnDrum. While recording in London, Jive (the group’s label) paired them with their own in-house production team that included keyboardist/producer Pete Q. Harris. Harris would be a crucial component in the album’s creation, playing keyboard, bass, and assisting in programming drums and samples.", 'By the time the record was released, the E-MU SP-12 was on the scene, the Roland TR-808 was still the center of many studio setups, and the LinnDrum was not considered a go-to machine for many hip-hop musicians.', 'In Brian Coleman’s book, Harris described the production of He’s The DJ, I’m The Rapper, saying, "The tracks we did for the album—which were recorded in Battery Studio Three—were done entirely with a Fairlight, with samples I had put in there from all over the place. Sometimes, we would use the LinnDrum or [Roland TR]-808 drums too."', 'When an NYC trio consisting of Bigg Jus, Mr. Len, and Company Flow released their debut album Funcrusher Plus, the project’s abstract rhymes and bruising chaotic beats threw down an aesthetic gauntlet that changed the sound of underground hip-hop.', "With production crafted by EL-P, Funcrusher Plus’s dramatic instrumental stabs, violent kick-snare patterns, and crisp turntable work characterized Company Flow’s sound as an update to the stripped-down sound that RUN-D.M.C. and Rick Rubin had pioneered over a decade prior. By incorporating haunting vocal and synth samples, CoFlow took the sonic lessons they'd learned from RUN-D.M.C. and pushed them into near-apocalyptic dimensions.", 'Speaking with The Fader in an in-depth interview about his production process, EL-P discusses how a sense of experimentation and discovery animates his work, while highlighting the EPS Plus as the machine that Funcrusher was created on. "In the early \'90s, I got my first real sampler, an Ensoniq EPS 16 Plus, and that was when it opened up for me in a lot of ways. That\'s what the Company Flow record was made on. After that, it went further. I started getting synths and Pro Tools, being able to layer more.”', 'In the mid-80s, West Philly hip-hop legend Schoolly D’s run of independently released singles would have a monumental impact on hip-hop moving forward. Acknowledged by many as the first gangster rapper, Schoolly’s funky, minimalist beats and vivid and graphic lyrics had a deep impact on West Coast rappers like N.W.A. and Ice-T.', 'One of Schoolly’s most impactful works was his 1985 single “P.S.K. What Does It Mean?” With its heavy kick and snare pattern, razor sharp hi-hats, and splashing cymbal rashes programmed on the Roland TR-909 and held together by a cavernous reverb, “P.S.K.” sounded like a bomb going off in the speaker systems of cars and Jeeps cruising around cities throughout the country.', 'One of hip-hop’s most enduring signature beats, “P.S.K.” has been sampled many times—most notably by Notorious B.I.G. (“B.I.G. Interlude”) and Siouxsie and The Banshees (“Kiss The For Me”).', 'Schoolly explained the process behind the creation of "P.S.K." in a 2004 interview with the Philadelphia City Paper, particularly illuminating how they achieved the booming reverb the single is known for while recording at Philadelphia’s Third Story Recording—a space outfitted to record orchestras.', '', '', 'Although the 909 remains a lesser-known alternative to its more famous predecessor, the TR-808, it has made its way onto a handful of classic hip-hop records. Few of these records have proven to be more unique and impactful than “P.S.K.”', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Today, it's most common for producers to rework a particular song's multitracks or stems from a DAW session. But where does remixing come from?", 'For the purpose of this piece, we\'re defining a remix as "a variant of an original recording ... made by rearranging or adding to the original."', 'In order for a remix to be a remix, the original recording has to be altered in some way, though in hip-hop, there are a few notable exceptions to this rule. (A Tribe Called Quest\'s "Scenario" and LA Jay\'s Fly As Pie remix of The Pharcyde\'s "Passing Me By" do not include any elements of the originals; both groups laid new vocal takes over completely new beats.)', 'But long before hip-hop, the remix as we know it was born in Jamaica.', 'In 1967 or \'68, Rudolph "Ruddy" Redwood, owner of the Supreme Ruler of Sound sound system, visited Duke Reid\'s Treasure Isle studio in Jamaica to create a dubplate of The Paragons\' "On The Beach." Dubplates were one-off acetates of brand-new songs that sound systems would get pressed up to premiere at dances.', 'According to Ruddy, as Treasure Isle engineer Byron "Smithy" Smith was cutting the acetate, he mistakenly left off the vocal track, leaving Redwood with one fresh acetate that only had an instrumental version of the tune (along with another acetate containing the standard mix). When Ruddy played this instrumental version tune later at a dance in Spanish Town, he\'d switch between the original vocal version and the instrumental, exciting the crowd and coaxing them to sing along. Energized by the crowd\'s reception, Ruddy convinced Duke Reid to begin pressing instrumental versions on the B-sides of his records.', "From that point throughout the early '70s, pioneering Jamaican producers like King Tubby, Coxsone Dodd, Lee Perry, and more gained renown by creating increasingly complex dubs—by turns leaving out or exaggerating different moments of the original recording. Using the mixing desk as an instrument capable of dramatically altering a mix, these early dub masters used tape delay, reverb, and EQ sweeps to transform classic roots reggae songs into ghostly, ambient renditions of themselves.", 'This practice of "dubbing"—and the subsequent stylistic innovations that it introduced—would have wide-spread implications for the way that music was made in Jamaica and beyond.', 'Around the same time, a fresh brand of uptempo soul music was taking over nightclubs throughout the US. The music that we now know as disco would play an integral role in helping to take the Jamaican practice of reimagining pre-existing recordings to a whole other level.', 'Outside of the dub masters of Jamaica, a DJ and engineer from New York named Tom Moulton is recognized by many as a pioneer of the remix—and the progenitor of the 12" dance single. In a series of events that were not dissimilar to Ruddy Redwood\'s happy accident that resulted in dub a few years earlier, Moulton stumbled upon the benefits of the larger-format disc.', 'In 1974, While working on a mix of Al Downing\'s "I\'ll Be Holding On" at Media Sound studio in New York, Moulton was informed that the studio had run out of blank 7-inches to press acetates on. Facing an impending deadline, Moulton and José Rodriguez, the engineer, pressed the song to the only available wax—which, that night, happened to be a larger blank. Moulton asked Rodriguez to cut the grooves wider, so that the track would fit as if it were a 7". In order to accomplish this, Rodríguez cut the track louder. When Moulton listened to the larger, louder record—which also benefited from a greater dynamic range—its effect was pronounced.', 'As Moulton told The Independent in 2006: "I almost died when I heard it. I knew I needed all my music like this." Soon, it would have a similar effect in discotheques the world over.', 'The new 12" single caught on, becoming a standard size for promotional discs given to DJs to break on disco dancefloors. Moulton, already an established DJ and a first-pick choice by record labels hoping to introduce new artists and songs to disco revelers, ushered in the new era.', 'In addition to his remixes for Downing, Moulton would gain renown mixing tracks for B.T. Express\' "Do It (Til You\'re Satisfied)" and Gloria Gaynor\'s Never Can Say Goodbye, as well as for classic labels like Salsoul and Philadelphia International.', "Moulton's mixes were characterized by echoed-out vocals, instrumental breakdowns, and extended play times perfect for DJs to continuously mix tracks and keep club-goers on the floor.", "As disco and club culture came to dominate the music scene in the '70s, a host of remixers emerged, taking a cue from Moulton and expanding on the blueprint that he laid down. Walter Gibbons, Larry Levan, John Luongo, François Kevorkian, and others would gain success with their inventive and memorable versions of disco and soul tunes, forever solidifying the remix's place in popular music.", 'As rap music began to migrate from the parks, rec centers, block parties, and clubs of New York, the genre\'s initial appearances on wax featured emcees backed by session musicians replaying grooves from popular disco tunes. Records like Sugar Hill Gang\'s "Rapper\'s Delight," Funky 4+1\'s "It\'s The Joint," "Body Rock" by The Treacherous Three, and more are classics in this style that live on as evidence of the connective tissue between hip-hop and disco.', 'In the 1980s, the production of hip-hop and dance music grew even more sophisticated with the increased availability of drum machines, synthesizers, and samplers.', 'Hip-hop pivoted away from the live band sound and would be largely produced with electronic instruments, while electro and dance music remixes from producers like John "Jellybean" Benitez, Tee Scott, Shep Pettibone, and The Latin Rascals ruled the clubs and radio.', 'One such remixer who got his start in the disco era—and whose work represents an important step in the evolution of remixing, as well as a bridge between the worlds of dance music and hip-hop—was Boston-born DJ/producer Arthur Baker.', 'He began his career independently producing disco/soul singles like The Hearts of Stone\'s 1977 single "Losing You." In the early \'80s, Baker rose to prominence working on a string of club classics like Freeze\'s "I.O.U." and Afrika Bambaataa & The SoulSonic Force\'s "Planet Rock" (created alongside his production partner, John Robie), as well as radio pop songs like Cyndi Lauper\'s "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun."', 'One of Baker\'s most innovative remixes of this era was his Special Dance mix of Paul McCartney\'s "No More Lonely Nights." In contrast to the common disco-era technique of remixing by rearranging and extending pre-existing elements from the original recording, Baker\'s remix of "No More Lonely Nights\'\' broke from convention by introducing completely new musical elements. With an additional synth melody, a percolating electro bassline, and booming beats, Baker transformed McCartney\'s dreamy ballad into an uptempo club jam.', "Around this time, one of Baker's proteges and former interns, a DJ/producer from Queens named Marley Marl, was making a name for himself producing a run of classic rap records, and completely reinventing what sampling and remixing could be in the process.", "Marl was one of the earliest pioneers of sampling, chopping one-shot drum sounds and using phrases scratched on turntables as the hook for a song—two techniques that are still widely used today. He became rap's premier super-producer in the '80s and early '90s, establishing himself as one of the most influential producers in contemporary music through his original work with Roxanne Shante, Biz Markie, and Big Daddy Kane, as well as his era-defining remixes for Heavy D, LL Cool J, Paula Abdul, and others.", 'Thanks to Marley Marl, and producers like "Hitman" Howie Tee and Teddy Riley, hip-hop remixing had, for the most part, shed the influence of disco and reggae. Gone were those genre\'s insistence on extended mixes and dubbing. Instead, new-school producers in hip-hop, house, and techno embraced the practice of crafting remixes that were completely new compositions.', "The possibilities of remixing were blown wide open as Chicago house and Detroit techno producers like Juan Atkins, Frankie Knuckles, and UK samplists like Coldcut were taking both new and familiar tracks and making them their own. One of hip-hop's greatest remixers in that regard was, not-surprisingly, a protege of Marley Marl.", 'DJ/producer Pete Rock came up as a teenager playing with Marley on WBLS radio in New York. When Pete broke out on his own as a celebrated producer and remixer, he went on a near-decade-long run, releasing several stunning remixes that are unparalleled in the genre.', 'Pete Rock\'s now-classic mixes of tunes like "Shut \'Em Down" by Public Enemy, House Of Pain\'s "Jump Around," and Das Efx\'s "Real Hip Hop" are characterized by his signature low-pass filtered samples, high-energy grooves, and funky rhythmic bounce. More often than not, Pete\'s remix of a song was vastly superior to the original and would take precedence as the definitive version in the minds of listeners.', 'Speaking on his process of remixing, Pete explains how he got into the craft: "The remix started with Eddie F and the Untouchables. I was doing R&B remixes at first. I thought it was kinda fun to create your own version of a beat to acapellas."', 'Today, the term "remix" has any number of meanings, all of which depend on the remixer, the genre that they are working in, and the creative method that they employ. While disco edits crafted by DJ Kon and labels like Razor-N-Tape, Midnight Riot Records, and Disco Deviants have kept true to the blueprint laid down by first-generation remixers like Moulton and Tee Scott, these days, a remix can be almost anything.', 'In the 2000s, inspired by smash hits like Busta Rhymes\' "Touch It" and Lil Wayne\'s "A Milli," rappers began releasing remixes that retained the music of the original, with multiple rappers jumping on and voicing popular tracks, similar to the ways in which Jamaican dancehall DJs would re-voice popular riddims.', 'In 2004, Danger Mouse\'s bootleg classic The Grey Album found the gifted producer aligning vocals from Jay-Z\'s The Black Album with original beats sampled from The Beatles\' White Album. With this landmark release, Danger Mouse sparked a legal firestorm, setting off the "mashup" craze (which has even deeper origins in \'90s "blend tapes" sold on the streets by hip-hop DJs like Ron G and DJ Juice) and raised questions about the nature of the remix and music creation itself.', "Whether it's Knxwledge's inventive, '80s-inspired flips of throwback Meek Mill freestyles or a club-ready remix of a chart-topping smash, our definition of what remixing really is—this practice of reinventing our favorite songs—is dynamic and ever-changing.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

It's a Russian invention that became a staple of Hollywood soundtracks. It's a seemingly cold, futuristic device that's forever linked to the work of the ultimate good-time, guys-next-door band, The Beach Boys. It's got a penetrating, visceral sound you create without making physical contact. All of the above apply to the Theremin, which has now been with us for a century.", 'In its basic form, the Theremin—named for its creator, Dr. Leon Theremin—is just a box with two antennae.', 'Those who don\'t get all goosebumpy over arcane electronic instrumentation will probably know it best as either the eerie, tension-heightening sound effect employed in countless \'50s sci-fi and horror films or the otherworldly swooping sound in the choruses of the aforementioned Beach Boys\' "Good Vibrations." (Trainspotters will cavil that the legendary tune actually employed a rare variation called the Electro-Theremin, which used a ribbon controller.)', "But the Theremin's legacy extends way before and after those famous phenomena. Its origins are part of a story straight out of a spy thriller full of international intrigue. It's been in and out of fashion several times, championed through multiple generations, by everyone from esteemed classical musicians to wild psychedelic adventurers and alt-rock rebels.", "Sometime in or around 1920 (the exact date is as mysterious as the inventor himself), St. Petersburg-born Professor Theremin was working for a government-run Soviet research center when he took the technological turn that led to the creation of what was originally called the Thereminvox. It was an electronic instrument with one antenna for pitch and another modulating volume, both controlled by moving one's hands nearer to or farther from the antennae without ever touching them.", "As a one-time cellist, Theremin knew how to coax melodious sounds from the invention that bore his name. Its keening tone could resemble a violin or a soprano voice, though playing it in tune was far from easy with no physical reference points. Theremin demonstrated it at the Kremlin for Lenin himself in 1922. The Soviet Union's big daddy was suitably psyched, and Theremin was eventually sent out as a musical ambassador to show it off to the rest of the world.", '"When Theremin went to New York, it was the classical music world that welcomed him," says Steven Martin, director of the documentary Theremin: An Electronic Odyssey. "[Legendary conductor Leopold] Stokowski commissioned him to build some Theremins that were tuned low for bass reinforcement, for use with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Except that Theremin made the frequencies so low that it was making the musicians sick."', "Nausea notwithstanding, the Professor's instrument was embraced by conductors and composers alike. The first composition for Theremin had already been written back in the Soviet Union in 1924 by Andrey Pashchenko, but in America, composers like Joseph Schillinger composed for orchestra and Theremin, with their works being premiered by prestigious orchestras. Even after the instrument declined in popularity in the '30s and '40s, forward-looking composers like Edgard Varese and Bohuslav Martinu continued to write for it.", 'But it was Clara Rockmore, the first Theremin virtuoso, who really showed the world at large what the instrument could do. "Clara Rockmore was a violin prodigy," explains Martin, "and was able to master the instrument to a level that no one has really matched. And in a way it validated the instrument. Without Clara, the Theremin would have just remained a novelty. She was on the radio several times, Stokwoski commissioned Anis Fuleihan to write a concerto for her, Concerto for Theremin and Orchestra, which was performed live three times. Bernard Herrmann, Stokowski, and Eugene Ormandy were the conductors. Clara was the only one who could play it."', 'In 1929, Theremin made a deal with RCA to manufacture his creation, finally patenting the instrument that had previously been considered the property of the Soviet Union. But due to an unfortunate confluence of factors, his name would never be seen in close proximity to the word "tycoon."', '"I think the Theremin may have been almost $500," ventures Martin, "and you could buy a car for that in the \'20s. They only built a couple hundred of these things, and it was released in 1929 the same week that the stock market crashed. So they only sold a few."', "Not to mention the inherent difficulty in mastering the instrument, which ensured that few would follow in Rockmore's footsteps.", '"Playing the Theremin is a little like playing the violin," says Martin, "in that it\'s essentially an endless fretless neck with an infinity bow. You can hold a note as long as you want, but you have to find the position where that note is. The problem with the Theremin was that since you didn\'t touch it, it was almost impossible to play. Anyone can make noise on a Theremin. To make music on a Theremin is something else."', 'Bad business became the least of Professor Theremin\'s worries when he was kidnapped in New York by the KGB and taken back to the Soviet Union in 1938. "What was envisioned as another tone color for the orchestra sort of ended up an orphan," says Martin, "and it was Hollywood that rescued it."', "Starting in the '40s, when composer Miklos Rozsa used it to underline Gregory Peck's psychotic episodes in Alfred Hitchcock's 1945 thriller Spellbound, the Theremin enjoyed a second life as the sound of all things spooky. Once it was picked up by Bernard Herrmann (who had once conducted Rockmore) for the 1951 science fiction milestone The Day the Earth Stood Still, the instrument became a staple of otherworldly cinema and TV for years to come, from 1953's It Came From Outer Space all the way up to '60s supernatural soap opera Dark Shadows.", 'During this Theremin renaissance, exotica king Les Baxter—never one to miss an opportunity—kicked off his recording career by collaring former podiatrist Dr. Samuel Hoffman to add some spacey touches to his orchestrations on the 1947 album Music Out of the Moon, which became a surprise smash and brought about two sequels over the next two years. When Neil Armstrong made his epochal lunar excursion in 1969, he brought a tape of Music Out of the Moon aboard the Apollo, literally bringing the sounds of the Theremin into outer space.', "Dr. Theremin's innovations led to the development of the modern synthesizer in the '60s. The voltage-controlled oscillators at the heart of all analog synth technology is a direct descendant of the discovery he made in four decades before. And Robert Moog, father of the synthesizer as we know it, actually got his start building Theremins before becoming an innovator in his own right.", "In the '60s, a gang of psychedelic journeymen with the memorable moniker Lothar & The Hand People took the Theremin someplace new, making it a full-time feature of a rock band for the first time—first onstage, as early as 1966, and then on their 1968 album Presenting… Lothar & The Hand People. The hippie crowd had never seen the like before, and Lothar—which was what the band dubbed their Theremin—went a long way toward turning paisley bandana-clad heads, for better or worse.", '"The first time we played it in San Francisco," remembers keyboardist Paul Conly, "at the Fillmore Auditorium, there were some young women that came up after we played one set and they were really freaked out. They were crying and almost hysterical. They were saying stuff like, \'Why did you do that to us?\' I felt bad about it! We were trying to put out loving vibes. But yeah, we did freak people out."', 'The band\'s singer and Theremin player, John Emelin, recalls an even more extreme reaction. "There was a guy who it turned out had a metal plate in his head," he relates, "and somehow the Theremin vibrated it. We didn\'t know what was going on, but suddenly this guy was writhing on the floor and twirling himself around and all that stuff. Had we known it was not just some creative dance move I would have stopped instantly, but later we found it out."', 'The Theremin employed by Lothar & The Hand People was Moog-built, and they were also among the first to bring an early Moog modular synth onstage. With their jungles of patch cords, unstable oscillators, and titanic dimensions, first-gen synthesizers were tough to tame. But synthesizers were still a lot more flexible than Theremins, and anybody who could hunt and peck melodies on a piano could make a synthesizer sing. So by the time the synth became more user-friendly and ubiquitous in the \'70s, most people pretty much forgot about its unique Russian ancestor (Jimmy Page\'s masturbatory onstage manipulations on Led Zeppelin\'s "Whole Lotta Love" notwithstanding).', 'That changed in the \'90s, largely due to the effect of Theremin: An Electronic Odyssey. In 1990, Steven Martin was in search of a Theremin for a different film project, and he ended up crossing paths with Clara Rockmore. "She showed me her instrument," he remembers, "the custom hot-rod model that Professor Theremin had built for her. My research told me that Professor Theremin had died in Russia sometime in the 1940s during the second World War, and she told me that he was still alive."', 'Before you could say "drastic change of plans," Martin and colleague Robert Stone were on a plane to Moscow to track down the unexpectedly extant genius. "It was still the Soviet Union, we had to sneak in pretending we were musicologists. The history books all said Theremin was dead, and we knew he wasn\'t. Lo and behold, there he was."', 'Over the next couple of years, Martin would come to know both Theremin and Rockmore well, eventually reuniting them in New York, and they became the core of a new story he wanted to tell.', '"I think I was the first one to put the big-picture story together with the arc," he reckons, "from Theremin to Moog, from Clara Rockmore to Miklos Rozsa and Bernard Herrmann. From Bernard Herrmann scoring science fiction and monster movies to Brian Wilson using it on \'Good Vibrations\' and Moog inventing the modern synthesizer."', "Released in 1993, Martin's documentary earned widespread acclaim, won the Documentary Filmmakers Trophy at the Sundance Festival, and received nominations for a BAFTA and an International Emmy. Unfortunately, 1993 also saw the death of Professor Theremin at the age of 97, so he didn't get a chance to see the new wave of interest sparked by the movie.", '"At that point no one was manufacturing [Theremins] anymore," explains Martin, "it really was considered an anachronistic instrument that was almost impossible to play." But after his film\'s release, Martin would repeatedly field requests from people seeking out the instrument.', '"I would give them Bob Moog\'s phone number. And enough people called, he started manufacturing them again. And now thousands and thousands of Theremins are out there, so there are more Theremin players now than there ever were back in the \'30s, in the heyday of the instrument," he says.', 'Since then, the Theremin has gone from overlooked wallflower to belle of the ball, lending its signature swoop to all sorts of scenarios. In 1996, alt-rock bad boy Jon Spencer used it while backing veteran Mississippi bluesman R.L. Burnside on A Ass Pocket of Whiskey. European bands like Stereolab and Pram used it to simultaneously signify vintage cool and point a way forward. A Theremin-based band even emerged calling themselves The Lothars, in homage to you-know-who.', 'And with a whole new field of instruments available to them, from Moog\'s Etherwave to its more recent Theremini, a new generation of true Theremin stylists have emerged, like Pamelia Stickney (nee Kurstin), Lydia Kavina, Carolina Eyck, Dorit Chrysler, and even former New Waver Bruce Wooley, most famous as co-writer of The Buggles\' "Video Killed the Radio Star."', "Chrysler is also co-founder of the New York Theremin Society, an extremely active organization promoting the instrument through workshops, performances, and more. To help celebrate the 100th birthday of the old professor's celebrated offspring, they've released the album Theremin 100, where artists from electronic music pioneer Herb Deutsch to synth-pop duo Hyperbubble contribute to the musical conversation that began a century ago in a Soviet laboratory.", '"Hardly any other electric instrument has the dynamic range and expression a Theremin can offer," says Chrysler. "Its unusual interface is hard to master and presents the ultimate challenge. No existing notation can grasp a Theremin\'s microtonal capacity ranging over seven octaves. Perhaps it will take another 100 years for the Theremin to find its true form, but its unique [tonal] color and versatility makes a compelling case."', "When the Theremin was first in vogue, it seemed like the instrument of the future. In the decades that followed, all manner of electronic instruments have followed in its wake, eventually coming to dominate the popular music landscape. It's a tribute to Dr. Theremin's lasting vision that, even after all that water under the bridge, in 2020 his box of wonders somehow seems just as futuristic as ever.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

A noise-canceling pickup that rejects 60-cycle hum, it has a sound all its own, and an abiding place at the center of many genres and playing styles. It’s also the name for the most valuable single electric-guitar component ever created… but more of that anon.', 'Mention the term “humbucker” and most guitarists will first think of the full-sized Gibson Patent Applied For (PAF) pickup of the late ’50s, which has become both the most revered and most reproduced form of this component. Cast your thoughts a little further, though, and likely you’ll stumble onto the Gretsch Filter’Tron, Epiphone and Gibson Mini-Humbuckers and Firebird pickups, Fender’s Wide Range Humbucker, a vast array of dual-blade and stacked pickups, and others.', 'But the humbucking pickup, and the concept behind it, existed long before the notion of bolting one onto a Spanish-electric guitar was even a glimmer in Ted McCarty’s eye.', 'The humbucker’s function is really quite simple, but also rather ingenious. Standard single-coil pickups produce an electronic rendition of your guitar strings’ vibration by means of a single coil of very thin wire wrapped around magnetic pole pieces (which might be either magnets themselves, or steel pole pieces connected to a magnet mounted beneath the coil).', 'Humbucking pickups, on the other hand, use two coils of wire each wound in reverse of the other, positioned around pole pieces of opposite polarity. When the two coils are wired in series, they still pass the guitar signal clearly, but the reverse-phase relationship cancels out much of the noise induced by electronic devices—the stuff that leads to the hum we hear in most single-coil pickups.', 'In conventional designs—the full-sized Gibson version in particular—the two coils are positioned side-by-side, which makes humbucking pickups a little wider than most single-coil pickups. The results of this extra width and the fact that the pickup is sensing vibration from across two different positions of the strings (and a little bit of everything in between) means that they also sound a little different from single-coil pickups, even when all else might be comparable specs-wise—regarding magnet strength, the length of the coil wire, and overall output.', 'Overall, and in simple terms, humbuckers are often heard to be a little warmer and smoother, although many can also be very bright and articulate, too. That “broad sonic window” can also push an amp pretty hard, even where vintage-style (aka “low wind” or “low output”) humbuckers are concerned.', 'Engineers were aware of the principles of using a second coil to cancel out the hum of the signal passed through the first, or both, since pretty early in the 20th century.', 'The “choke coil” was used in radio manufacturing long before the guitar amplifier was even a thing and passed into use in guitar amps too well before the concept was translated to pickup design.', 'So, who was the father of the humbucking pickup? You’re thinking Seth Lover for Gibson, or arguably Ray Butts for Gretsch, right? How about… Armand R. Knoblaugh, an engineer working for the Baldwin company in Cincinnati, Ohio. Knoblaugh filed a patent for a hum-canceling musical-instrument pickup in December of 1935 (awarded in 1938), a solid 21 years before Gibson filed for a patent for its own humbucking pickup. (If there are earlier humbucking pickup designs we haven’t found them, but feel free to call them out in the comments section below.)', 'Intended for use with piano, Baldwin’s stock-in-trade, the design on the patent application shows two long, stacked coils, one on top of the other, with multiple pole pieces to cover several piano strings at a time.', 'In the text of the application, Knoblaugh states, “The principal object of my invention is the elimination of effects caused by stray magnetic fields and such elimination of the device of my invention, without affecting its sensitivity to the motion of adjacent magnetized strings.” In other words—the humbucker is born!', 'What the…? No, this isn’t the name you expected to see tied to “first humbucker on an electric guitar.” But a probe of the history of the development of hum-canceling pickups for this market throws up some real surprises.', 'One of which is the fact that Leo Fender actually made the first application among notable manufacturers to patent a design for a humbucking guitar pickup, albeit one intended for use on a lap-steel guitar.', 'A little different from what we would conventionally think of as a humbucking pickup, Fender’s design specifies two coils wound in opposite directions, with magnetic pole pieces inserted at opposite polarities, and installed in a plate that makes them appear more like two entirely individual pickups, yet wired together in series as a single unit for hum-canceling signal generation.', 'Fender filed his patent application on March 29, 1956, nearly three months before Seth Lover’s application on Gibson’s behalf, discussed below. He was granted his patent relatively quickly, too, in December of 1957.', 'The pickup itself was only rarely used, first appearing, it would seem, on a 1957 Fender Deluxe Lap Steel. After this, Fender also developed a hum-canceling bass pickup in 1959, as used on the Precision Bass thereafter, but the company wouldn’t put a humbucker on a standard Spanish-style six-string electric guitar until the early ’70s.', 'In 1955, Gibson president, Ted McCarty, wanted a new pickup to provide a novel selling point, and he tasked engineers Seth Lover and Walter Fuller with the job. Lover decided the thing might as well improve on existing units, too, and hum rejection was the way to go.', 'Lover was already familiar with the concept of a choke, used to help suppress noise in the power supply of guitar amplifiers, so he ported those principles over to his dual-coil pickup design. Otherwise, the original Gibson humbucker that hit the market first on some Gibson lap-steel guitars in 1956, and the Les Paul Goldtop and Custom models in ’57 had largely similar ingredients to the preceding single-coil P-90 pickup—just split across two coils, and with one bar magnet rather than two.', 'It was also just a little different from his first functioning prototypes for the unit, thanks to some input from the sales department. Lover’s early iterations had fixed steel pole pieces in both coils, but, as he told guitar writer Tony Bacon in 1998, “When the sales force over in Chicago saw it, they said they didn’t have anything to talk about adjusting screws. So [laughs] they wanted adjusting screws, and that’s why we brought out this style here that has the adjusting screws.', '“And I set the pickups in the guitar with the screws towards the bridge and towards the fingerboard. People wanted to know why did I do that. For decorative purposes [laughs].”', 'Lover filed a patent application for the new design on June 22, 1955. Back in the day, patents tended to take quite some time to be awarded, so Gibson started applying little black decals that read “Patent Applied For” to the bottoms of the pickups in late ’56 or ’57, to discourage copying. Abbreviated to “PAF”, the term has come to denote the original Gibson humbuckers made up until early 1962, when a patent number was finally added to the new decals.', 'That’s “a” patent number, rather than “the” patent number: The patent itself was finally awarded on July 28, 1959, but the common theory has it that Gibson wanted to use up the existing decals before moving on. When the new “Patent No.” decals were eventually printed, they included the patent number for the combined trapeze tailpiece and bridge design used on the very first Les Pauls, not the number for the pickup itself. Whether this was an intentional effort to keep copyists from looking up the design at the patent office or just a clerical error is difficult to say.', 'In any case, Gibson’s PAFs of around 1957 (when the design really settled into itself) to early ’62 didn’t only succeed in their efforts to buck the hum; good examples are considered to be some of the most musical, dynamic, expressive, and overall lustworthy tone generators that have ever been coupled to an electric instrument.', 'Biting yet somewhat compressed in the attack, bright yet rich and warm, extremely dynamic, and loaded with harmonic overtones, the Gibson PAF has established a sonic template that has been central to some of the most classic recordings in the broad realm of rock, and original units have become highly prized as a result.', 'It is beloved for its ability to drive a cranked-up tube amp into toothsome distortion and singing sustain, yet can also be a sweet and musical sounding pickup when played through a clean amp. Find a set in good, original condition, and you’re likely to pay $6k, $8k, or even $10k USD for a pair of PAFs made between ’57-’60, and only a little less for units from ’61-’62.', 'Although Gibson is generally credited with being the first major guitar manufacturer to have brought a humbucker to the market, there’s strong evidence that the pickup that would become the Gretsch Filter’Tron was in development even before Seth Lover and Walter Fuller began their hum-canceling efforts up in Kalamazoo. The trouble seems to be that Gretsch was a little slower to start publicizing the creation, and to make it standard equipment on its guitar lineup.', 'It appears that some time in 1954, guitar star and Gretsch artist Chet Atkins asked his inventor pal Ray Butts to develop a tight, clean, hum-canceling pickup. Butts had designed and built the EchoSonic amplifier with built-in tape echo that Atkins had starting making good use of, alongside Elvis Presley guitarist Scotty Moore, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, and others, and he seems to have been pretty quick to get a working humbucker in motion.', 'During early disputes of “first-humbucker rights” between Gibson and Gretsch, Butts pointed out that he had photos dated from 1954 showing Chet Atkins using the new pickup, but he had applied for his patent just a little later than Lover had for Gibson’s, and the so-called Filter’Tron—for its ability to filter out electronic hum—wouldn’t appear on Gretsch guitars until late 1957, and more widely in ’58.', 'A narrower pickup than the Gibson PAF humbucker, with smaller coils and generally only about half the output, the Filter’Tron is known for its clear, crisp, clean sound—which makes sense, given it was designed for Chet Atkins’s articulate country picking. Played through an overdrive pedal, though, or into an amp that’s set at the edge of distortion, it can deliver anything from biting semi-dirty twang to a breed of snarling rock ‘n’ roll that still retains a crystalline clarity amid individual notes. As such, it has become another classic for yet another genre of player.', 'Much of the guitar industry’s quest of the late ’50s and early ’60s, and that of guitarists themselves, was for the greater treble content that would help them cut through the mix. As such, the desire for a brighter humbucker became a big part of what drove pickup design in general.', 'To accompany its radically new “reverse-body” Firebird of 1963, Gibson designed a mini-humbucker with a solid cover hiding two narrow coils, each wound around an Alnico II bar magnet that also served as its “blade” pole piece. Bright, sharp, and biting, they definitely fulfilled the desire for cutting treble content, while also pushing an amp decently well for more grinding rock ‘n’ roll playing.', 'Epiphone also had a smaller humbucker in development around the time Gibson acquired the company in 1957, and this is the pickup that appeared on popular semi-acoustics like the Sheraton. (It’s worth noting that a somewhat earlier and similar looking Epiphone pickup was actually a single coil, but one made with the pole pieces set off to one side of the pickup, making it appear to be a mini-humbucker).', 'In the late ’60s, Gibson adapted the format for the Mini-Humbucker that debuted on the Les Paul Deluxe of ’69. Despite the skyrocketing popularity of the original Les Pauls of the late ’50s—of which the full-sized PAF humbucker was a major ingredient—this Mini would be the standard humbucker for Gibson’s seminal single-cut electric throughout the ’70s, while the SG Standard took on the full-sized humbuckers.', 'When Fender finally decided to put a humbucker on a six-string electric guitar, the company’s former chief pickup designer—Leo Fender himself—was already exiting the stage, post CBS buy-out, so another legendary inventor was called up for the task. Seth Lover, the father of the Gibson PAF humbucker, went to work on a new design in 1970, and the resultant Wide Range Humbucking Pickup was soon in use on the revamped Thinline Telecaster, and found its way to the neck position of the Telecaster Custom early in ’72.', 'Although it appears outwardly to be much like the full-sized Gibson humbucker, if a little larger, the Fender unit actually uses cunife magnet pole pieces within each of its side-by-side coils, with offset sets of three per-side threaded for adjustability, while the remaining six are non-adjustable and hidden beneath the pickup cover.', 'True to Fender’s sonic legacy, the use of magnetic pole pieces, rather than steel pole pieces with a magnet charging them from beneath, results in a bright, clear humbucker, but one that is still fat and meaty, and which drives the amp pretty hard.', 'By the early ’70s, the majority of truly classic humbucker designs were already up and running, and most further developments would either be modifications or extensions of these templates, or—several years later—more radical re-thinks intended to further extend the format for more forward-looking guitarists.', 'Much of the tone quest of the ’70s involved a drive for power, output, and distortion, and many makers pursued these ends via hotter pickups. Larry DiMarzio designed his Super Distortion humbucker in 1972 along the basic lines of the Gibson PAF, but with more powerful ceramic magnets and a lot more turns of wire in each coil, and founded the DiMarzio company in ’75. Others like Carvin, Seymour Duncan, and EMG soon followed, each focusing for a time on the “high-output” humbucker, but often settling back into more vintage-inspired designs as well.', 'In recent years, of course, the replacement-pickup market has veritably exploded, with makers chasing both period-correct renditions of the classic original designs, and radical new inventions that entirely rework the concept of translating string vibration into electrical signal.', 'By about the mid to late ’80s, “humbucker” no longer necessarily denoted the wide format, or even a unit with two coils positioned side-by-side. Joe Barden pioneered narrow dual-blade humbuckers in 1982, after first winding several prototypes for Telecaster wizard Danny Gatton. DiMarzio and Seymour Duncan patented designs for “stacked” single-coil-sized humbucking pickups in 1984 and ’85 respectively, with two opposite-wound coils positioned one atop the other in, for example, a united designed to fit a traditional Stratocaster or Telecaster mounting.', 'Come the 21st century, myriad companies have pioneered entirely alternative designs for hum-canceling pickups that fit in traditional, narrow single-coil housings—Fishman, Lace Sensor, and Kinman being prominent among them—as well as futuristic new forms of full-sized humbuckers. All the while, the race for “best reproduction of a vintage PAF” might be hotter than ever among dozens of acclaimed boutique pickup makers, and many of the big names as well, and the popularity of the humbucker circa-’57 shows no signs of waning.', 'About the author: Dave Hunter is the author of The British Amp Invasion: How Marshall, Hiwatt, Vox and More Changed the Sound of Music—which contains further behind-the-scenes tales of the birth of the British guitar-amp industry—as well as The Guitar Amp Handbook, Amped, and more than a dozen other books on guitars, amps, and related gear.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

The second wave, led by The Who, Cream, Jethro Tull, Led Zeppelin, and many others didn't bring just one brand, but several—the biggest of which was Marshall.", "But there were plenty of other interesting British amps that came along from the '60s to the '80s and which are still to be found today, sometimes at attractive prices and often with great potential for the tone hound. Here are six makers and models worth looking for.", 'For more on vintage British amps, see the original entry in this series here.', 'Sometimes (and very wrongly), Hiwatt is thought of as just a sturdier Marshall. Hiwatt amps were the brainchild of the designer Dave Reeves, who cut his teeth working on Sound City amps before striking out in 1968 on his own with the Hiwatt brand.', "Popular legend associates Pete Townshend with Marshall, but as he has said many times in interviews, he was never a great fan of the archetypal Marshall distorted sound. Townshend had started with Fender amps and later discovered the huge, clean volume of Hiwatt's heads and the cabs loaded with Fane speakers.", "Robustly made to military specs, Hiwatt's amps had a sound of their own—and Townshend loved it. He was not alone. Jethro Tull, The Moody Blues, and perhaps most significantly Pink Floyd's David Gilmour all loved it, too. Hiwatt went rapidly from strength to strength.", 'Sadly, Reeves died in an accident in 1981, following which the company suffered a disastrous split in ownership. An American company acquired the rights to the name in the USA, and a separate company owned the name in the UK. Neither venture was showered with glory, meaning a good bet is to try to find a Hiwatt produced before Reeves died. This is easily spotted, because the tubes were mounted directly onto the chassis, where later ones were sometimes not so well constructed.', "Hiwatts came in 50, 100, 200, and 400-watt versions, with a variety of combo options. All are distinctive sounding, but probably the most sought after is the 100-watt EL34-powered DR103, much in demand by Gilmour fans. Teamed with a Fane-loaded 4x12, there isn't much to touch a DR103, though Gilmour famously paired his with WEM 4x12s.", "Don't overlook lesser Hiwatts—they all share the family sound and robustness, are easy to service and repair, but are unlikely to be cheap. Recently, the divided Hiwatt family was reunited under a single Canadian owner and is in the process of being revived.", 'If Hiwatt and Marshall epitomized British tube amps, HH was the exact opposite. The electronics designer Mike Harrison was a pioneer of high powered solid-state amplification, and he had an impressive pedigree, having worked on power amp designs for industrial users and the BBC.', 'Turning his attention to guitar, bass, and PA amplification, Harrison introduced solid-state amps to the musician\'s market in 1971. Despite being all-transistor at a time when "transistor" was a synonym for "unreliable" and "bad sounding," the new HH products met with some success, despite the fact that they, too, suffered from reliability issues. You can add "noisy" as well, because they were.', "As production continued, the amps became more reliable. They certainly stood out from the crowd, thanks to a glowing green electro-luminescent front panel that became an HH trademark. Loud and clean, they became popular on the semi-pro scene but won few notable pro users, with the exception of Marc Bolan. Unusually for solid-state amps from this era, HH's IC-100 models are still serviceable thanks to a dedicated specialist in the UK, MAJ Electronic, whose website is worth reading for the style, let alone the encyclopedic content.", 'HH made some very creditable PA amps, which at one time seemed more or less standard issue for British semi-pro bands, as well as similarly good bass amplification. But the HH amps to look out for are the "Music Range" V-S Musician models from the mid \'70s. "V-S" stood for "valve sound," which was stretching a point. What they did have was characteristic HH loudness and good looks, onboard distortion, and some attempt to get a tube overload sound.', 'Arguably it was the bass version, the V-S Bassamp, that was the best of the lot, but a V-S Musician (with or without reverb as an option) could make a useful purchase today.', "HH Electronic was a few decades ahead of its time as its loud, clean formula could appeal today to guitarists who derive their tone from pedals. Look out, too, for HH's superb power amps, like the V150-L, V200, V500, and V800 models. HH stumbled when it overreached for new markets, and it was eventually sold to a rival UK amp maker, Carlsbro, which sold on the HH name to fellow UK maker Laney in the '90s.", "Jim Marshall wasn't the only music-shop owner in Ealing, west London with a range of his own amplifiers. Dave Simms had some, too—and for a brief interval his amps were also very successful, though quite different from Jim's offerings.", "The Watts half of the name came from electronics designer Richard Watts. Simms-Watts offered sturdy and powerful amps for bass, keyboard, and guitar, as well as PA. They had some influential users, too, and the most prominent was The Who's John Entwistle, who endorsed the bass amps alongside those from Hiwatt.", "In some ways, Simms-Watts amps were more akin to Hiwatts than Marshalls, offering huge headroom before distortion and strong construction. It wasn't only bass players who liked the sound. Mick Ronson—David Bowie's guitarist during the Ziggy Stardust era—was another Simms-Watts fan.", "Two models in particular worth looking for are the AP100, with EL34 tubes, and the AP200, with KT88s. Both are loud, clean, and much liked by pedal users. Current users of vintage Simms-Watts include Jamie Cook of Arctic Monkeys, who favors an AP100. Simms-Watts was sold to the giant EMI company in the early '70s and vanished not long afterward.", "Inextricably linked with Hiwatt, Sound City was designer Dave Reeves' first foray into manufacturing, working either as a contractor or an employee (accounts differ) for the distributor Dallas-Arbiter. Reeves initially built 100-watt tube heads in the back of the Sound City shop in London, eventually settling on the L100 amp design, which was launched in 1967.", 'As with the amps Reeves later produced under the Hiwatt name, these were loud and a lot cleaner than the Plexi Marshalls they competed against. It was a formula much liked by The Who—they immediately became users and were soon followed by Jimi Hendrix, who sometimes used Sound City stacks alongside his Marshalls.', "After Reeves left to go solo, Sound City carried on, led by Denis Cornell (who is still in business as a boutique builder). Though it is said Dallas-Arbiter wanted to sacrifice some of Reeves's obsession with quality, Cornell's Sound City offerings are not to be sniffed at. The 200 was a KT88-powered 200-watt monster that stands comparison with the Marshall Major. It's well worth tracking one down, especially if you have the taste for clean and loud—and you look forward to becoming a good customer for a hearing aid specialist.", "Gregg Burman had a relatively short but meteoric career as a major-brand UK amp builder. Starting out in the industrial heartland of Newcastle upon Tyne in north-east England, Burman began making his characteristically bomb-proof tube amps in 1966. He labored away locally, earning a strong reputation, until the late '70s when his amps suddenly exploded onto the scene.", 'The exceptionally well-built (but heavy) Burman Pro Series was launched in 1974 and featured a triple preamp gain section. The first series came in 50-watt and 100-watt single or twin-channel combos, in 1x12 and 2x12 versions, and there were also 100-watt heads. Later models saw a switch to high quality Gold Lion KT77 tubes (they were badged accordingly) and were then rated at 70 and 100 watts respectively. Notable users included Thin Lizzy—Scott Gorham was particularly keen—and Status Quo.', "Burman launched the GX3 preamp, which received rave reviews and should have gone on to be a great seller. Unfortunately, Burman closed the company in the early '80s, having lost a controversial lawsuit with a publisher. A few years later, he suffered a disabling stroke and never returned to amp making. For all that, many Burman amps still survive. They were well ahead of their time, are still repairable, still sound extremely good, and are not overpriced.", "German refugee Mat Mathias formed RadioCraft in Yorkshire, northern England in the mid '40s, and for some years he traded in a small way above a shop selling sweets and tobacco. Mathias won a reputation for building great sounding, sturdy amps for local bands during the '60s.", 'In 1968, Cliff Cooper, who owned a music shop in London, approached Mathias, asking him to begin building amps under the name of Cooper\'s shop: Orange. The result was the near-legendary Orange Matamp, used by Peter Green (reputedly featuring on "Albatross"), Paul Kossoff, Jimmy Page, Wishbone Ash, and a host of other \'70s guitar heroes. Impossible to miss thanks to Orange\'s striking color and graphics, an original Orange Matamp head would be very desirable today.', "The partnership between Cooper and Mathias ended in the early '70s. The story goes that Cooper wanted more amps than Mathias felt he could build to the standards he insisted on. Matamp continued alone, and the rarest of these amps worth looking for from the post-Orange era is possibly the 1981 V-14 1x15 combo, of which only 40 were said to have been made. They were superbly versatile.", 'Mat Mathias died in 1989, but Matamp carried on and still produces very traditional tube amps. If you don\'t mind something more recent, try a 1992 (and later) Green Matamp, a sort of "breathed on" GT 120, named for Peter Green. Around 1998, a US Matamp was born, but space prohibits retelling what became a long and tangled story.', 'Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Rolling Stones used Sound City amps at their 1969 Hyde Park concert. They in fact used Hiwatt amps for the occasion.', 'About the author: Gary Cooper is a journalist working in the musical instrument and pro audio fields. He contributes to a number of music magazines and websites.

This sound has its roots in Houston, Texas, where the slowed down tempo flowed in lock step with the culture of drinking the sedative "lean"—a drink containing prescription cough syrup of promethazine and codeine—which also originated in Houston.', 'The world commonly refers to the sound as "chopped and screwed" music, a phrase coined by fellow Texas legend DJ Screw. Ron C may not remember every detail, but his memories aren\'t clouded by revisionism.', '"Chopped and Screwed is DJ Screw\'s version of slowed down music. So, the genre is slowed down music. Screw is the one who came through and made it popular. It\'s like a gumbo," Ron C tells Reverb. "Zatarain didn\'t create gumbo, they just made it cool for everyone to buy it in the store. That\'s basically what DJ Screw did."', 'Ron C has fond memories of the precedent-setting inventiveness ("I\'ve seen Michael Watts chop up a record off of two cassette decks"), productivity ("I\'ve done over 25,000 projects, for sure—I may be undershooting"), and how the equipment never made the magic—the elite understanding of DJing did.', '"If you know the real essence of how to chop up a record, then you\'ll know you\'re chopping up the record and not the words. The words will fall into place. A lot of people don\'t know that, so I just gave them some new game."', 'Reverb caught up with Ron C, 25 years after he and Watts started changing the sound of music, to hear how his approach and equipment evolved over time.', 'Before the days where an average person with any DAW can slow down any song they want in a few clicks, Ron C was making digital magic with analog tools. "Back then, we used Technics SL-1200 turntables and actually recorded to an analog Tascam multitrack tape recorder."', "Generally, the process went: Watts and Ron would listen to music and find the songs they felt were good to manipulate. Then, they'd get behind the 1200s, hook it up to a mixer that would then be connected to the Tascam—recording their transformation of that record on the spot to a cassette tape. That means those 70-minute After Da Kappa, Before Da Kappa, Spring Break, and Summer mixtapes from the '90s were recorded in one take; an extended moment of magic that can't be perfectly duplicated in recollection.", 'Ron C\'s name started growing with the Fuck Action mixtapes, a collection of slowed down R&B songs that were "strictly for the ladies, so it was R&B," as opposed to the hip-hop on other mixtapes. While DJ Screw was chopping up on the southside of Houston, Ron and Watts were on the northside working at Houston\'s KBXX 97.9 FM radio station. Watts, being the radio DJ, gave them an edge they rode for years.', '"It was really off the head. I don\'t want people to think we sat down and actually wrote down what songs we were going to have for the mixtapes," Ron C said. "Watts was the radio DJ and got all the music before a lot of [others], so we had to find innovative ways to get the music out to the public on the streets before they could get it."', "Ron C's DJing talents are central, but the technology dictated the limits of the magic. He fondly remembers the 1200s giving him the control to pitch a record as low as -8. Then the pair moved onto the Technics 1200 MKII, which took the sonic depths to -16. Then, in the late '90s, CDs surpassed cassette tapes and vinyl, and the pair got another edge that would cement them as legends in the South.", '"Whenever CDs came out, we were on it. That\'s how we got past Screw. We were the only people in the world where you could get music on a CD, because nobody had a CD burner. We found a place in Princeton, New Jersey called Princeton Disc that sold the very first CD burner made to the public, which cost $9,000 at the time."', 'In early 1998, Pioneer released its CDJ-100S, a turntable system that plays CDs instead of vinyl, but Ron C understood its value beyond simply being able to play music from the latest piece of tech. The CDJ-100S allowed Ron C to pitch music down to -24, three times as deep as he was able to just a few years before. It also allowed for the DJ to start and stop a record at a certain point with more precision, and the CD format dramatically improved the sound quality over cassette tapes. Watts and Ron C were on the frontlines of the next era of slowed down music and made sure to keep up with the latest gear to stay that way.', 'Recorded music is a symbiosis of man and machine. To some extent, it\'s impossible to separate the expansion of a genre from the advancement of the equipment available. Ron C admits he and Watts "always tried to stay ahead with our DJ equipment," but he staunchly asserts the magic was man-made.', '"We used to get criticized. We were so cold, people thought we were using computers, at one time, to make these chops sound like that. But, we never did. We only used computers to capture the moment."', 'In the late \'90s, as the pair was looking for ways to improve the sound, the Tascam was replaced with the Roland VS-880 and VS-1680, ushering them into digital sound quality. But, the process still involved a tedious tracking process. "You sit there, listen to it, and when it comes up to when you want to track it at, you had to make sure you hit it. If you didn\'t, you had an off track. If you listen to some of them, you\'ll see they don\'t start at the right point—they\'re off because it was a manual process."', 'Around 2000, slowed down music underwent two seismic changes: Ron C left Swishahouse and the personal computer started entering the home. After years of tedious recording with the Tascam and Roland gear, Ron C\'s mixes had finally transitioned to the computer via the multitrack recording software Cakewalk. Now, the CDJ would be connected to a computer, and Ron C could go back and make revisions if he messed up on a mix. "We already had our style and technique down, so it didn\'t take but one shot. We were professionals."', '"After the Cakewalk era, it went to the Pro Tools era and we ain\'t look back since then. Nothing has come to beat Pro Tools and Pioneer."', 'In this new era, Ron C connected with the new school of hip-hop greats, like the most streamed artist of the 2010s, Drake.', 'A noted admirer of the Houston music culture, Drake told Ron C in 2009 that he listened to all of the DJ\'s Fuck Action tapes to write his music. One day in Houston in 2009, Ron C brought Drake the entire catalog, and the pair have been close ever since, with Ron C giving his treatment—which he now calls "chopped not slopped," in reference to the influx of new slow music practitioners who lack his turntable deftness—to Drake albums, including Take Care and Scorpion.', '"For Take Care, we were probably on the [Pioneer] DDJ-1000, because they were cold. Those were the first ones they made that actually felt like a turntable," Ron C remembers. "Even if it was your album, I mixed it together to make it a mixtape, mixed and blended."', 'His decades of sonic alchemy attracted more than rappers. Filmmaker Barry Jenkins was a fan of chopped and screwed music and reached out to Ron C to give the "chopped not slopped" treatment to the Moonlight soundtrack. Ron C says Jenkins gave him original tracks from the film along with a few of his favorite songs.', '"There were parts of the movie that had sound in it that we needed without the acting over it," Ron C says. "We created our own pitch. We have always had our own way of how we pitch down records."', 'Now, Ron C is the head of The Chopstars, a collection of up-and-coming DJs keeping slowed down music alive. He may not remember every detail of every moment, but he does remember how he made the magic.', '"I\'m going to have to protect the secret with that one."', "About the author: Keith Nelson Jr is a seasoned music journalist who followed his innate passion for knowledge to interview some of the most influential figures in the music industry.

With rare exceptions, it's centered around a computer, file folders teeming with samples, plugins, and half-finished DAW projects. If there's real tape of any kind, it's in a vibey reel-to-reel, a Tascam Portastudio, or some similar analog appendage brought in when a producer wants a pinch of honest saturation or tape-loop experimentation.", "If you're one such producer, what could you learn from a pioneer of home recording? A man who burned through contacts in Britain's burgeoning studio industry, built his own processors from discarded machines, and tacked strips of taped sounds to his walls to use in his productions?", "Joe Meek, as that description may already make clear, was obsessed by the possibilities of recording. In the 1950s and '60s, he stretched available technology well beyond its established means, riling many of his coworkers while inspiring others.", "As Barry Cleveland writes in Joe Meek's Bold Techniques, Meek was also gay in an era and in workspaces that were hostile to homosexuality, with such ridicule no doubt leading to resentment. Meek's singular approach to recording could be seen as arrogant, and could put others in difficult positions: for example, the mastering engineers who had to contend with his highly compressed and EQ'd mixes, or the next session's engineers forced to find a new balance among the controls Meek had wildly spun to his liking.", 'Meek could also have aggressive mood swings, is reported to have been abusive to some band members under his charge, likely suffered from bi-polar disorder and schizophrenia, and, from about the mid-point of his career forward, was a heavy user of amphetamines and barbiturates. His life ended in violence.', 'But the work that he made—from early pop-inspired jazz records to chart-topping sonic experiments like "Telstar" and the cult-classic album I Hear a New World—are all documents of a pioneering producer. That some of his best and most experimental work was made in his own apartment, when even world-class studios were meagerly appointed by today\'s standards, is all the more astonishing.', 'So, what could Meek still teach us today?', "With so much recording technology at our fingertips and success stories of producers making hit records at home, it can be seductive to think you don't need to work with anyone else to get started. But Meek's later home-studio recordings greatly benefited from the years and effort he put into professional engineering work.", 'In Joe Meek\'s Bold Techniques, Cleveland recounts Meek\'s time with the People Are Funny road show, where Meek and another engineer would be sent with equipment by train to capture live performances. Left to his own devices, Meek inhabited a "show must go on" mentality whenever technical failures or challenges occurred. It was a trial-by-fire period in which he delivered the recordings no matter what.', 'As Cleveland tells Reverb, Meek\'s role on the show grew rapidly and set him up for his future: "A week after he was promoted from projector boy to junior engineer on People are Funny, he was promoted to chief engineer, responsible for overseeing the entire operation—and reportedly he pushed the crew to perform at a very high level. So, besides becoming a professional live-recording engineer and tape editor, he honed his skills as a team leader and producer."', 'Meek took his experience there to gain a foothold in recording studios. In a similarly fast career trajectory, his engineering skills were quickly recognized inside the studio walls, allowing him to become a de-facto producer. Sometimes he was given leeway to experiment, though often he had to deliver what lead producers or A&R men expected of him, pushing the boundaries where he could.', 'For example, on Humphrey Lyttelton\'s "Bad Penny Blues" in 1956, he compressed the sound of the brushed snare drum so much that it became a driving element of the recording. It may not sound like much to today\'s ears, but at the time, using such a high amount of compression was not common. The song popped out of speakers because of it, becoming an unlikely instrumental hit that later inspired Paul McCartney\'s piano part on "Lady Madonna."', "Meek experimented for experimentation's sake, from his early days of multitracking with two handheld tape recorders and throughout his career. But what made so many of his later home-studio experiments effective was that he had a sonic vision in mind: Not only had he spent enough time with gear to know everything it could do, but he often knew what he wanted the result to sound like, even if it would require some creative engineering to realize.", '"He was familiar with pro gear from having worked in major studios early on, and so wanted to achieve that level of sound quality to the extent possible given the resources available to him no matter what he was recording," Cleveland says. "On the other hand, he built a compact spring reverb in 1957, co-invented tape flanging in 1958, modified pretty much every piece of gear he ever owned, built his own equalizers and compressors, and made good use the Clavioline and other exotic instruments, all to in some way better realize his sonic vision."', "I Hear a New World, Meek's 1959 album—recorded at his apartment and mixed in stereo there by still somewhat unexplained means—is as illustrative as an animated movie. Maybe a bit of this impression is thanks to the characterful voices, like the pitched-up chipmunk vocals of the Globbots, but the musical arrangements move in and out of the audible frame, building, bar by bar, the scenes of Meek's imagined planet.", "In writing Joe Meek's Bold Techniques, Cleveland spent more time with Meek's original mixes than just about anybody. (In an unfortunate twist of fate, most of the available recordings of the album were re-mixed after Meek's death.) Cleveland released his own restored and remastered version of I Hear a New World, using Meek's original mixes.", 'As just one example of how Meek\'s creative arrangements create sonic scenery, Cleveland writes of "The Dribcots Space Boat":', '"This composition is highly programmatic, and consists of three distinct sections: take-off, flight, and being whisked away, as Meek says, \'perhaps into orbit around some other heavenly body.\'', '"Meek creates the feeling of rising by having the steel guitar slowly slide up the neck, in time with a fantastic creaking effect, almost like the sound of a door opening. … These two sounds are accompanied by cymbal washes in the background, and a minimalist bass part. At the end of the 20-second opening section the steel guitar plays a series of four very interesting chords, and then there\'s an abrupt tape splice into a completely different and entirely unrelated section."', 'At a time when pop, jazz, and classical recordings were still mostly about getting the song down on tape, Meek was one of the first to emphasize the sound, the visceral effect, and the imagery a recording could conjure.', 'As mentioned above, Meek had walls of tape loops and sound effects at his apartment/recording studio. Cleveland says, the "hundreds of tape loops hanging from nails … were essentially the equivalent of a modern sample and loop library."', 'On I Hear a New World alone, you can hear a huge assortment of sounds from this personal sample library. The liner notes of one reissue cite: "Running water, bubbles blown through drinking straws, half-filled milk bottles being banged by spoons, the teeth of a comb dragged across the serrated edge of an ashtray, electrical circuits being shorted together, clockwork toys, the bog being flushed, steel washers rattled together, heavy breathing being phased across the mics, vibrating cutlery, reversed tapes, a spot of radio interference, (and) some, well-quirky percussion."', 'But Meek not only used sound effects for his concept album. Cleveland says, "His sound effects were a huge contributing factor to the hit records he engineered for major artists at commercial studios in the 1950s, and were essential to his more campy productions later on."', 'Gary Miller\'s "Robin Hood" from 1956 featured Meek\'s self-created sounds of arrows. Anne Shelton\'s "Lay Down Your Arms" had the sound of marching soldiers thanks to Meek\'s box of rocks.', "More than any one novelty effect, Meek's work is marked by a fascination with sound. With the limited technology of his time, he went out of his way to capture the sounds around him, from thunderstorms to screeching tires, and create his own.", 'There are plenty of contemporary producers doing the same, like Havoc using a gas stove\'s click as hi-hats in Mobb Deep\'s "Shook Ones Pt. II" or Boi-1da sampling windshield wipers for Meek Mill\'s "Tony Story, Pt. II."

The Jazz Bass, which started production in March 1960, was a slightly more upscale model that sat above the earlier Precision Bass in the company\'s line. "This is Fender\'s newest addition to the field of electric basses and represents the standards by which others will be compared," boasted the press release, noting among the Jazz Bass\'s features list a "new" type of control layout: "Tandem tone and volume controls for each pickup permit mixing for wide bass tone selection."', 'It\'s one example of how Fender in those days regularly took ideas that already existed and adapted them for its own use. The "tandem controls" of those early Jazz Basses—today we\'d probably call them stack knobs—had already appeared on, for example, several Danelectro models since at least the mid-\'50s. Dano called them "television type" controls, and it was on TVs and radios of the period that they\'d originated.', "An amplified bass was not a new idea in 1951, when Fender introduced its first bass—the Precision—to the market. Thirty years earlier, in the '20s, Lloyd Loar, an engineer at Gibson, had experimented with a slimmed-down electric upright bass.", 'In the following decade, Rickenbacker offered a stick-shaped electric upright bass ("held upright or in playing position by our new folding adjustable stand"), as did Regal ("fine for all fretted groups as well as orchestras") and Vega ("bass players have been looking for an Electric Bass to enhance their own position and to give the orchestra greater bass foundation").', "None of these efforts were commercially successful, and they weren't helped by the quality of amplification at the time. It seemed as if makers knew that bass players wanted a louder, tonally pleasing instrument—but they couldn't find the right way to help.", 'Everett Hull, a working bassist in New York City, approached the problem from a practical angle. He figured you could take the existing upright bass and amplify that. In the late \'40s, Hull produced an amplification system for the acoustic upright with a microphone inside the bass\'s pointed peg, or base spike. This "amplified peg" gave the company its name, and Ampeg enjoyed moderate success with its scheme for adapting upright basses to amplified sound (and rather more with its amplifiers).', "The idea of a fretted bass wasn't new, either. Multi-string fretted bass instruments such as the bass lute and theorbo dated back to the 1600s or so. But at the beginning of the 20th century, Gibson came up with the Mando-bass, a four-string fretted instrument that continued as the largest item in its mandolin line for 20 years or so from the early 1910s.", 'A \'20s Gibson catalogue showed one Eleanor Camp seated and playing the acoustic Mando-bass with a pick. She held the instrument angled guitar-style across her body thanks to the support of an "adjustable extension floor rest," a metal rod that protruded from the lower side of the instrument and rested on the floor.', 'Gibson described the fretted Mando-bass as "unusually easy to play." What they didn\'t say was that this $150 instrument did little to project its sound through the band and into the audience. It was not a great success during its surprisingly long life—Leo Fender knew about a local band who used a Mando-bass in the \'40s.', "There was even an electric bass guitar that predated Fender's Precision. Paul Tutmarc, a Hawaiian guitar player and teacher based in Seattle, started a company called Audiovox in the '30s to manufacture electric instruments, including an electric bass guitar.", 'His Model 736 Bass Fiddle was first offered for sale in 1936. It had a simplified guitar-shape walnut body, a single pickup and control knob on a pearloid pickguard, a neck with 16 frets, and a cable emerging from a jack on the upper side of the body. It was a remarkably early electric bass guitar design, and Paul Tutmarc should be remembered as a man with admirable foresight, if little commercial luck.', 'Tutmarc\'s son, Bud, later marketed a similar electric bass guitar, the Serenader, through the L.D. Heater music distribution company of Portland, Oregon. Heater\'s undated flyer—Bud claimed the instrument was launched in 1948—described the $139.50 Serenader as "designed to eliminate the bulkiness of a regular size [upright bass]."', "None of this detracts from the significance and importance of Fender's introduction of the solidbody electric Precision Bass guitar in 1951. The Bass Fiddle and Serenader basses, even though they were first, made no impact on the market or on music. By contrast, Fender's electric bass guitars would become industry standards.", "Back at the close of the '50s, however, players were only slowly becoming aware of the potential for bass guitars, and most guitar companies still regarded the instruments with caution, despite tentative steps by Kay, Gibson, Danelectro, and Rickenbacker. A big maker like Harmony, never usually slow at identifying and exploiting market opportunities, did not offer a bass guitar model until 1962. Similarly, Fender did not feel that the market would support a second model in its bass line until 1960 and the introduction of the Jazz Bass.", "There are other examples from early Fender history of the company's tendency to look around itself, absorb what was going on, and adapt what it found into its own products. Fender's original solidbody guitar designs, the Tele and the Strat, lifted a few ideas from a one-off boutique guitar that Paul Bigsby made for Merle Travis a few years earlier.", 'According to Travis, Leo borrowed that guitar, returning it a week later and asking Travis to try one "almost like it" that Leo had made. "I told him I thought it was great," Travis recalled replying. Fender\'s marketing boss Don Randall wrote about Travis in a 1950 letter, saying: "He is playing the granddaddy of our Spanish guitar, built by Paul Bigsby—the one Leo copied."', 'Dale Hyatt, who ran Leo\'s radio store for a while and soon became an important part of Fender\'s sales force, described Leo as a real thinker. "His belief," Hyatt recalled, "was that he could take anything anybody else made and make it better—and make money doing it. He really felt that. No matter what it was, Leo thought anything he had in his store at the time, if he set out to do it, he could do a better job."', "It wasn't just the guitars and basses that revealed outside influences. When Leo and Ray Massie developed the first K&F and Fender amps, they looked up the circuits in manuals that RCA produced to promote its tubes—just as almost every other early amp maker did in the United States. And when Fender produced its first self-contained Reverb Unit in 1961, the device was adapted from Hammond's established spring reverb system.", 'In fact, Leo Fender and his colleagues were like any other team of product developers past or present—probably wondering if it\'s impossible to make something completely original and new. Anything supposedly "new" usually draws upon what has gone before, however inconspicuous or subtle the influence might be.', 'These are considerations that face every creative person. The French artist Eugène Delacroix put it well around 200 years ago: "What moves people of genius, or rather what inspires their work, is not new ideas," he wrote in his journal, "but their obsession with the idea that what has already been said is still not enough."', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

There were many older, analog drum machines on the market, but it was the release of cutting-edge sampling-based digital drum machines like the RZ-1 that would change the course of music-making as we know it.', "Unlike popular (and more expensive) '80s drum machines like the Oberheim DMX, Roger Linn's LinnDrum and Roland's legendary TR series (the 808 and 909), the RZ-1 was a fully digital drum machine with onboard sampling capabilities—and arrived as a more affordable alternative to pricier sampling drum machines like the Korg DDD-1 and the E-Mu SP-12.", 'But while it was an entry-level sampler, hip-hop producers would soon use it for top-tier productions.', "The RZ-1 comes with 12 factory drum sounds (bass drum, snare, open and closed hi-hat, clap, cowbell, ride, crash, and three toms). Users can control the playback volume of each drum sound with 10 volume faders, while stereo outputs let you route sounds into an external mixer. The machine also has a backlit LCD display screen and MIDI in/out/thru sockets. The RZ-1's internal memory has room for 100 patterns and 20 songs.", "Unlike the analog drum machines that preceded it, the Casio RZ-1's internal sounds are based on PCM technology. PCM, or pulse-code modulation, is a method of creating digital representations of sampled analog audio signals. In the mid-'80s, the PCM method was used in the sound engines of instruments like Roland's legendary D50 synthesizer and drum machines like the DDD-1. The Casio RZ-1's internal drum sounds are charmingly lo-fi, with audio specs registering at 12 bit/32Hz resolution.", "With a sampling memory that allows for just 0.8 seconds of sampling time, the RZ-1 is extremely limited by today's standards—or even when compared to contemporary machines like the E-Mu SP-1200, which was released a year after the RZ-1 and sported a massive (for the time) 10 seconds of sampling memory.", 'In addition to the RZ-1\'s factory drum sounds, assigned on 12 pads, the RZ-1 comes with four open user-assigned banks/pads, where users can either assign four samples of 0.2 seconds to each or one "long" sample up to 0.8 seconds.', "Released at the onset of rap music's first Golden Era, the RZ-1 was popular amongst first-generation hip-hop producers who were learning to make beats. With its affordable price tag, the RZ-1 allowed budding hip-hop musicians to pre-produce records in their homes, forgoing booking unnecessary hours in the expensive professional studios of the day.", "Veteran DJ/producer Prince Paul cut his teeth in the '80s as a member of pioneering Long Island rap act Stetsasonic—a group that is widely acknowledged as the first (self-contained) hip-hop band. Following his stint with Stetsasonic, Paul linked up with an idiosyncratic rap trio named De La Soul. Their 1989 debut, 3 Feet High and Rising, mixed up sampled sounds from a wide range of '60s and '70s artists including Eric Burdon & War, Steely Dan, and The Turtles.", 'Over three decades after its release, the album remains a watershed moment in hip-hop and sampling history. Speaking with The Guardian in the 2014 article "How We Made 3 Feet High and Rising," Paul gives some insight into the album\'s creation, name-checking the RZ-1 as an essential piece of its production:', '"We made the whole of 3 Feet High and Rising for $13,000, using just a Casio RZ-1 drum machine/sampler and another gadget called an Eventide harmonizer, which allowed us to match songs that had totally different pitches—we could put Daryl Hall\'s voice over a Sly & the Family Stone record. It was amazing."', 'When Reverb asked Paul about the RZ-1 for this piece specifically, he emphasized the machine\'s usability, saying, "It\'s like a Dollar Tree SP-12... not quite the name brand but still gets the job done."', "Before the MC, producer, and Wu-Tang Clan cofounder RZA would employ the SP-1200 and Ensoniq sampling keyboards to create countless hits in the '90s, he got his start crafting beats on the Casio RZ-1. In a 2015 interview with Kotori Magazine, RZA talked about his teen years, producing on the RZ-1 and making beats for his friends in the neighborhood:", '"Now I had to tell my man that I know how to make beats too, but I had never had that kind of equipment. I also had a Casio RZ-1 but I didn\'t have that SP-1200, which was the best thing you could ever get. It took maybe a year and a half until I finally got a hold of one. So I was about 19 when I first got my SP-1200, and on it I made \'Bring The Pain\' and a few other classic Wu joints."', "In the 2019 HULU series Wu-Tang: An American Saga, a dramatized version of teenaged RZA can be seen rocking an RZ-1, reflecting the producer's real-life history with the machine.", "Rapper/producer Beans of the legendary avant-rap trio Anti-Pop Consortium also cut his teeth making beats on the RZ-1. APC's production was a radical mixture of gritty hip-hop beats and minimal, experimental sounds. Unlike Paul and RZA, Beans would also use the RZ-1 as a live instrument with APC and when playing with his mythic live electronic ensemble, The Blank Slates.", 'Speaking with Reverb, Beans goes into detail about his work with the RZ-1:', '', '', "In the years since the RZ-1 helped shape the sound of '80s hip-hop producers, the machine has also gained a small but loyal following among the circuit-bending/instrument-modifying community. Even a quick Google search will lead you to forums with enthusiasts discussing techniques to expand and modify the RZ-1. On the circuitbenders.co.uk forum, a user called gmeredith explains the ways in which the RZ-1's sample memory can be expanded:", '"You know that you can do a sample memory expansion for the RZ-1, exactly the same as the sample expansion I did on my SK-8. I expanded my SK-8 from 4 samples (just like the RZ) to 128 samples! That sample RAM chip ... can be taken out and replaced by a much bigger capacity RAM chip. The expansion won\'t give you longer sample times, however, just more samples of the RZ\'s standard sample times. For the RZ, it will give you 128 banks of the 4 samples = 512 samples, at the push of a button!"', "Like any great instrument, the musicians that have employed the Casio RZ-1 continue to embrace its quirks and push past its limitations to make some truly great music. The fact that musicians have been utilizing and tweaking the machine more than three decades would've been impossible to predict when it was first manufactured way back in 1986.

The Moog modular system, pictured tantalizingly on the cover, that Carlos had turned into an orchestra, offered a whole new universe of possible sounds. But few would ever get the chance to own one of those elaborate and expensive systems.", "Annette Peacock, however, was not like most people. Soon after hearing the album, she'd convince Bob Moog himself to let her have a prototype of a new modular system. And shortly after that, she'd be performing with it live, routing her vocals through its modules to create an unsettling, alien voice.", 'But how did a young songwriter, still relatively unknown, get a new Moog system for free?', "By the late '60s, Peacock had already been steeped in Albert Ayler's free jazz, having toured with the saxophonist's group while married to its bassist Gary Peacock. After that short marriage, she began writing and performing with her second husband, pianist Paul Bley, for whom she composed what she called free-form songs, or sparse jazz ballads with plenty of room for improvisation.", 'When she heard Switched-On Bach shortly after its release, the record and its Moog synthesizer were a revelation.', 'Speaking to The Quietus in 2014, Peacock said, "I got really excited because it was the first new instrument in 300 years and I was trying to encourage Paul and get some enthusiasm going. I said, \'We have to get this instrument.\'"', 'While Bley was at first not enthusiastic, Peacock had more to prove. "He was not that interested because he didn\'t have to be," she said. "I was the young artist, so it was very exciting to me as I hadn\'t established myself yet. I didn\'t have an allegiance to anything that I needed to abandon to pick up the synthesizer."', 'Peacock saw the emergence of the synthesizer as the next step in her free jazz evolution: "That\'s what attracted me to synthesizers, thinking if I could create the sound, start from initiating the sound at the beginning, creating the rise time and the envelope and the decay time, I could slow things down even more. So I was interested in forming a sound that didn\'t already exist from the beginning."', 'The couple convinced Moog to let them come check out his work. But visiting is one thing; driving away with an expensive modular system is another. On the way there, Peacock thought up what would prove to be a convincing pitch:', '', '', "At the same time, rock luminaries like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones were buying and beginning to use Moog's new instruments—and they learned, as Peacock did, that the manual-less systems were difficult to learn.", "After having successfully commandeered a Moog, Peacock could barely use it for six months, as she and Bley tried to find someone to teach them how. Peacock took matters into her own hands. As recounted in Thom Holmes' 2008 book, Electronic and Experimental Music: Technology, Music, and Culture:", '"The instrument sat dormant in the bedroom of their New York apartment for several months until Peacock set up the complicated machine and started to experiment. After trying out various patches, Peacock discovered that she could plug a microphone directly into one of the modular\'s source input jacks and modulate it using the machine\'s filters and oscillators. By the end of 1969, they were taking the bulky instrument on the road."', "Performing and touring as The Bley-Peacock Synthesizer Show, the group's electrified jazz and Peacock's Moog-effected voice could be heard on stages like New York's Town Hall and, eventually, on the group's debut album. The record company and audiences both didn't quite know what to make of it.", 'In a short documentary about the making of her 2000 album An Acrobat\'s Heart, Peacock looked back on this time and said, "You bring things to people, right—you think they\'re going to be really excited about something. But we took it on the road and got booed off stages. That was a shock."', 'By her own account, it was a "nutty band," and one that also required quite a bit of set-up time.', '"At that time [a] synthesizer was generally very difficult to use in the live situation because it was huge and heavy to move around, and not designed for that purpose. And it was unstable. I was never quite sure what sound I was going to get and I was very much flying by the seat of my pants," Peacock told The Quietus. "When we first started performing with it, the audiences had to wait for 20 minutes between songs while I changed the patches from a book of diagrams I\'d made. It was very convoluted, but we were pioneering and one has to expect that sort of thing."', "You can hear Peacock's Moog-drenched voice on Revenge: The Bigger the Love the Greater the Hate, the Bley-Peacock Synthesizer Show's debut album that, while recorded in 1969, wasn't released until 1971, after her original record label refused to release it. (In 2014, Peacock re-released it under her own name as I Belong to a World That's Destroying Itself.)", "By 1971, Peacock was signed as a solo artist to RCA Records, bringing her street-wise blend of synthesis, rock, and avant-garde jazz to I'm the One. While that record too never caught on with a large audience, it did cement Peacock as an innovative artist, and, in the decades since, has become a cult classic along with later albums like X-Dreams and The Perfect Release.", "Enjoying the newfound appreciation for her early work, Peacock has been performing live again, on rare occasions, such as her scheduled appearance at this month's Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, Tennessee.

To be sure: Her sublime voice stands on its own in the Anglo-folk canon, but her songwriting and lyricism are equally impressive. Both aspects of her talents remain essential to the fabric of the British folk-rock movement of the 1960s and ‘70s. Though the modern music press frequently portrays Denny as a cartoon-ish caricature of a temperamental singing faerie, she in fact endures, 40 years after her death, as an unexampled lyricist and songwriter, and an equally magnetic performer.', 'Born Alexandra Elene MacLean Denny and raised in the London suburb of Wimbledon, Denny was inspired early on by her grandmother, Mary Smith MacLean, whom she didn’t know well, but whose presence was fierce. MacLean insisted young Denny be called “Sandy,” the Scottish shortening of Alexandra. She also brought to Denny’s blood a musical prowess and passion, as she’d been a known balladeer of arcane Scottish traditional tunes in her time.', 'After finishing primary school Denny began a short stint training as a nurse at a London hospital, at the behest of her prim parents, who didn’t see music as a viable career. Inspired by Bob Dylan’s Freewheelin’, and encouraged by her older brother David, she began working out covers by American folk singers, as well as Scottish traditionals, on a hand-me-down acoustic guitar. After learning a few chords and practicing at home, she became an audience fixture among London’s folk music houses, which were inspired by the American folk scenes in Greenwich Village and North Beach in San Francisco, and were spreading like spores across the Big Smoke. Denny soaked in each performer studiously, and often sang covers on the floor as an unpaid warmup between acts.', 'With a growing passion for music and live performance, Denny became acutely aware that nursing would never be a good fit. In the fall of 1965 she was accepted into a foundation course at Kingston College of Art—required studies for acceptance in a bachelors program—where there was a swelling folk music scene in nearby clubs like The Barge (an actual barge docked on the Thames). She’d already performed at the beloved floating club a couple of times and was becoming engrained in the local folk circuit, hobnobbing with scensters like visiting American Jackson C. Frank, and locals Bert Jansch and John Renbourn, who’d go on to form folk-fusion act Pentangle.', 'She didn’t last long at university. A busy schedule of performances at local nightclubs led to her earliest recordings with local folkies Johnny Silvo and Alex Campbell: Alex Campbell and His Friends and Sandy and Johnny, both released by London’s Saga label in 1967, when she was just 20 years old. On each LP Denny performed covers by Jackson C. Frank and Tom Paxton, as well as a number of traditionals. These earliest LPs endure as momentos of Denny’s budding folk club repertoire. Her stirring version of trad “Make Me a Pallet on Your Floor” prelude her emotive and heartrending original compositions soon to come.', 'A chance encounter at The Troubadour coffeehouse swung open a gate for Denny’s interest in songwriting. Dave Cousins of London folk outfit The Strawberry Hill Boys asked Denny to join the group after seeing her perform onstage in the club’s cellar. All Our Own Work by Sandy Denny & The Strawbs was recorded over two weeks in Copenhagen. Twelve songs were captured, including Denny’s breakthrough and most enduring composition, “Who Knows Where The Time Goes?,” which showcases her emotive power and palpable solitude simply and immediately in the first verse, over minor-key acoustic guitar:', '"Across the purple sky, all the birds are leaving\nBut how can they know, it’s time for them to go?\nBefore the winter fire, I will still be dreaming,\nI have no thought of time.\nFor who knows where the time goes?\nWho knows where the times goes?"', 'But with the release of that album greatly delayed, the world would have to wait two more years to hear that beauty, on Fairport Convention’s excellent third LP, Unhalfbricking. By the time Denny joined Fairport Convention in 1968, they were already the most besainted act of the British folk-rock scene, having magnetized UFO Club owner and noted producer of the period Joe Boyd, who’d helped them secure deals with Polydor Records and then Island Records. Denny won over the group with a cover of Jackson C. Frank’s “You Never Wanted Me” during her audition and replaced singer Judy Dyble, who’d founded the group with bassist Ashley Hutchings, guitarist Simon Nicol, and guitarist Richard Thompson, notable for his later solo works and collaborations with his wife Linda.', 'Denny brought a more plaintive, less pop-oriented intensity to the group with her wide vocal register and open-ended songwriting style. Under Denny’s leadership, they became less focused on ape-ing American folk acts, and instead carved out a signature appreciation for British traditional songs and the negative space between notes. The Denny-penned original “Fotheringay,” which opens Fairport’s second album, What We Did on Our Holidays, is the shaky and incongruous LP’s saving grace, a mystical meditation on isolation and death, inspired by the story of Mary, Queen of Scots.', 'The cover of her second album with the group, Unhalfbricking, released in 1969, features a portrait of Denny’s parents, Neil and Edna, standing outside their family home in Wimbledon—the band barely visible in the background. Though the Unhalfbricking version of “Who Knows…” is notable, and prompted a slew of covers, its full band noodling and subdued vocals temper its fire, making it more pleasant than powerful. Denny stayed on with Fairport through the recording of the heralded album Liege & Lief, their first record comprised mostly of adapted British and Celtic traditional songs, with Denny’s profound delivery front and center. Today, it’s considered the most important record in the British folk-rock movement, a beacon of modernity inspired by antiquity.', 'Conjecture about Denny’s departure from Fairport Convention abounds to this day. Some cite a new relationship with Australian folk musician Trevor Lucas—others, her increasing thirst for alcohol. Regardless, Denny left the band shortly after the release of their most prestigious album, as unceremoniously as her audition in a humble folk music dive.', 'Her short-lived collaboration with Lucas, also called Fotheringay, was unremarkable, and Denny soon embarked upon a solo career that yielded mixed results. As magnetic a performer as she was, her personal insecurities and alliance to folk music traditions muddied a clear path to crossover audiences. She wasn’t a pop singer.', 'Her 1971 solo debut for Island Records, The North Star Grassman and the Ravens, is no clearer testament to that. An album comprised of mostly Denny-written songs, the only time it veers off course is when she covers others—Dylan’s “Down in the Flood” and Charles Robins’ “Let’s Jump The Broomstick.” Of the album’s 11 original songs, eight are phenomenal. The title track, a core-rattler. It leaves one to wonder what Denny might have been capable of earlier, if empowered to write and record more originals by her peers in The Strawbs and Fairport Convention.', 'Her single album with The Strawbs, All Our Own Work, finally saw a release in 1973 via the Hallmark label, a nascent subsidiary of Pickwick International. For the first time, folk-rock fans heard Denny’s masterpiece, “Who Knows Where the Time Goes?,” in its purest and most arresting form. Though Denny would die five years later due to a brain hemorrhage, her compositions on the passing of time, loss, love, and tradition, and her unparalleled voice, live on.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

No, we’re not talking modeling amps or the all-the-bells-and-whistles solid-state combos that have begun to proliferate the market.', 'Instead, these are fairly simple, straightforward tube amps, yet they’re calibrated to work seamlessly with the effects pedals that play such a big part of so many guitarists’ creative endeavors today. Call them "pedal platform amps"—they’re exactly what many of us have been craving for years.', 'In the video above, Andy Martin digs into three main pedal platform amp categories—low wattage amps, high headroom amps, and dual channel amps—that pedal heads get great results with, and shares some of his go-to picks. Below, learn even more about what makes a pedal platform amp different and ideal for representing the sound of your effects board.', 'The term "pedal platform" refers to an amp that excels at being used with effects pedals—particularly drive pedals, which are connected in between your guitar and the amp’s input.', 'Sure, you can use your overdrives, boosters, fuzzes, and distortion pedals with any amp and they’ll work, but the true pedal platform amp translates the signal from these devices in a way that elevates both the pedal’s sound and the amp’s sound to the best that they can be. It’s a sound that’s better than the sum of its parts, or indeed than either of the parts used independently.', 'Put another way, a great pedal platform amp will sound very good all on its own, delivering a rich and clear clean sound or applying medium-crunch when cranked up a little bit—and your overdrive pedal will sound pretty darn good into just about any amp. Put them together, though, and they function as a seamless unit: The overdrive takes the edge-of-breakup amp into delectably tactile and euphonic territory that’s more playable and sonically appealing than either device on its own.', 'The reason these amps work so well when paired with pedals is that they have a preamp stage that’s designed to be pushed over the edge from clean to overdrive by a pedal, but before getting there, they have a lot of headroom—which is to say that they sound fairly clean up to relatively high volumes when played with just a guitar straight into the amp.', 'With a good pedal introduced, when pedal and amp get past the edge of breakup together, hand in hand, it’s a glorious tone—thick, articulate and touch-sensitive, and far more dynamic than the raw sound of an overdrive pedal slathered over a cold, clean amp.', 'Great pedal amps have been with us kind of "by accident" since the dawn of guitar amplification—before pedals even existed. But in recent years, several creative amp makers have been honing their designs toward the end of enabling them to cooperate well with pedals.', 'Clearly, they’ve recognized a demand for these things. Hardly a week passes by on any popular amp-related chat room or discussion board on the interwebs when some participant doesn’t ask other members to "recommend an amp that plays well with pedals." The demand is undoubtedly there and, boom, queue the supply.', 'You usually know an amp that’s not a great pedal platform when you hear one: Maybe your booster pedal accentuates odd frequencies when you switch it on, or your low-gain overdrive pushes something in the amp’s gain stage into unresponsive and ill-defined sonic mush. But what makes a pedal platform work with drive pedals, where others don’t do so well?', 'Many players seeking a pedal platform look for an amp that sounds great clean—rich, full, balanced and dynamic—with better headroom than average, and that’s certainly part of the equation. The other side of that coin, though, is that an amp that sounds great clean makes a great platform onto which to stack gain pedals to push the sound harder. So that’s step one, but there’s more to it than that…', 'From a technical perspective, great pedal platforms generally have preamp stages that are fairly balanced and robust-sounding on their own. They’re not especially finicky about input levels, so they aren’t likely to collapse into fizzy or shrill high-end spikes when hit hard. At the back end, such amps often have output stages that are pretty firm, tight, and punchy, relative to their size.', 'While plenty of amps using the popular 12AX7 twin-triode preamp tube can be great pedal platforms, lots of players and manufacturers alike have recognized that lesser-seen pentode preamp tubes like the EF86, 5879, and 6AU6 often contribute to preamps that handle overdrive pedals extremely well.', 'That’s largely because they are robust tubes that can be hit hard without crumbling into fizzy clipping. They also pass along well-balanced and full-frequency signal to the next stage down the line, rather than distorting and compromising the signal before it even gets to the EQ and output stages.', 'These pentodes can be run to achieve fairly high gain stages in some designs (like the "click" channel of the Matchless DC30), but in other amps that take a more reined-in approach, they can contribute to full, juicy clean tones and rich, dynamic overdrive when hit with a good drive pedal.', 'Vintage Gibson GA-40 and Vox AC15 amps used these tube types (although the latter can sometimes be a finicky pedal amp for other reasons). Newer examples that employ them include the Dr Z Z-28 and Route 66, the Divided by 13 JRT 9/15 and others, and the Todd Sharp JOAT series, all of which make excellent pedal platforms without necessarily having that as their stated intention.', 'Latching on to this new sector, several makers are designing and building excellent pedal platform amps from the ground up.', 'Nolatone’s Club Master is exactly such an amp, using a 12AX7 preamp tube in a "cascode" (yes, cascode with an "o," not cascade) configuration that mimics the performance of a pentode preamp tube. This enables a robust input stage that reacts beautifully with overdrive pedals. Likewise, 3rd Power’s Wooly Coats Spanky MkII combo was designed to be its best self as part of a pedal-lovin’ setup, as was Dr Z’s M12, which does its thing with an EF86 pentode preamp tube in the front end.', 'More powerful options come from Port City’s Pearl in either 50 or 100 watts—a bespoke design intended to gobble up pedals—and Creation Music’s Milano 50, a 50-watter with two independent channels offering EF86 and 12AX7 stages, respectively. (Creation also does 15- and 20-watt Milano combos for those needing less volume.)', 'Of course, an amp doesn’t have to be advertised as a "pedal platform" to do the job well, and you shouldn’t have to spend a fortune on it, either. Plenty of other types built over the years—from medium and large Fender tweed-style amps (and their clones) to the simpler, lower-gain Marshall designs—can make excellent foundations for a pedal-boosted overdrive sound.', 'There are a lot of great pedal platforms out there disguised as simple, no-frills tube guitar amps. If you’re on the hunt, though, in many ways it’s easier to identify what characteristics to avoid when seeking an amp that works well with pedals, and chances are the amps left standing after the elimination process might do the job perfectly well.', 'A great pedal platform will most likely not:', 'Be an overly saturated amp that has a ton of bright shimmer and harmonic jangle and swirl in its own tone.', 'Have cascading gain stages designed to generate a lot of preamp overdrive to produce its own lead sound (although the "clean" or "rhythm" channels of many such amps might themselves make good pedal platforms).', 'Exhibit over-hyped bands, notches, humps, or dips in its frequency response. That is, it likely won’t have a particularly scooped midrange with over-emphasized highs and lows, or a major midrange hump. And note that amps with sharp, spikey or overly harsh high-end responses often tend to make poor pedal platforms.', 'To be clear, many such amps that aren’t ideal pedal platforms might be superb-sounding amps on their own—and they may be some of the most revered amps around just as they stand. They might also interact perfectly fine with a pedal or two, but their general characteristics don’t tend to favor ideal pedal platform status.', 'You don’t have to spend a fortune or buy boutique to obtain a great pedal platform either. Consider these options among recent makes and bargain vintage amps alike:', 'There are plenty of others out there, too. In the end, you usually have to just plug in a selection of your favorite pedals and play to find out if any particular amp will be the right pedal platform for you. But following some of these guidelines and learning a little in advance about any amp you’re considering should help you cut out a lot of the legwork.', 'Do you have a pedal platform that’s working great for you that hasn’t been mentioned here, or which might take other guitarists by surprise?

Kirk's band defined a sound on the previous year's Master Of Puppets album, and Metallica had been touring relentlessly since, sometimes with Scott's band Anthrax on the bill.", "Following Cliff Burton's tragic death in a tour bus accident in Sweden, Jason Newsted had taken Cliff's place in Metallica's bass slot, playing his first shows with the band in November '86.", '"We played a few shows, to break Jason in," Kirk tells me. "Meanwhile, I\'d noticed that Scott had this really cool guitar, with a cartoon graphic painted on the front of it, which he told me he got from a Japanese company called ESP that had an office in New York. And just right off the bat he said: \'And they\'ll give you a guitar, too!\'"', 'At that point, Kirk says with a smile, no one was exactly tripping over themselves to sign him up as an endorser. "Our band was still quite the bastard stepchild of the music industry, the media world, and just overall culture. So I said to Scott, \'Yeah, man, I\'m totally, totally into it—no one has really given me a free guitar before.\'"', "And so here they were, Kirk and Scott, freshly arrived in the upstairs rooms that served as ESP's American headquarters, and excited as hell.", "ESP (Electric Sound Products) began in 1975 as a small custom shop in the back of a Tokyo music store, established by Hisatake Shibuya. He gradually expanded the business to include manufacturing, retail, and music education. At first, ESP's Navigator-brand guitars were copies of the usual US classics, alongside a large and impressive line of parts—bodies, necks, hardware, and so on.", "When Hisatake sent one of his employees to open ESP's first overseas office in New York in the early '80s, it gradually became clear that there was potential for a more original take on the traditional models—especially when key players like Kirk, Scott, and others began to provide input about their own particular tastes in modern high-performance guitars.", 'Matt Masciandaro was a tour manager and guitar tech at the time, working with Aerosmith, Motörhead, and the like. During 1985, he was hired by Dokken as tech for George Lynch. Matt remembers George finding an ESP neck he liked at a store and asking Kramer if they could reproduce it.', '"The builder at Kramer said, \'Well, you\'re going on tour in Japan, aren\'t you—why don\'t you just go to ESP and get a neck?\' Kind of dumb," Matt says with a laugh, "you know? But sure enough, George and I went to ESP in Japan, into one of the retail shops, and they said, \'You\'re George Lynch! We\'d love the opportunity to build you a guitar!\'"', 'George recalls that a number of ESP people were present at the Tokyo meeting toward the end of 1985. He\'d had a short-lived endorsement with Aria, and Kramer had talked about signing him up, too. But here was a real opportunity. "ESP had their technicians there, in lab coats, pen protectors in their pockets, the micrometers, taking down notes," George tells me. "We sat around all afternoon riffing back and forth, working out what became my ESP Kamikaze guitar."', 'He told them exactly what he wanted. "Back then, bigger was better, heavier was better, more was more. So I said it had to be a high-gain pickup, a heavy piece of wood, very thick, a minimal amount of routing. And I wanted graphics: a Kamikaze pilot, some bombs, a couple of kanji characters. I guess because I was in Japan for the first time in my life, the first thing that popped in my head was a Kamikaze pilot. In retrospect, it seems like probably a little politically incorrect. But anyway, as a starting point we used my Tiger guitar, a parts guitar I\'d put together."', 'George had built a number of parts guitars before Dokken and in the early days of the band, using necks, bodies, and bits and pieces by Charvel, Mighty Mite, Sandoval, and others. Not only for himself, but also for the students he\'d teach locally. "Everything was pretty much Strat-based, superstrat, generally one hum but sometimes more than one, and graphics that me and my friend Irv Veech would come up with and paint in his garage."', "The first ESP Kamikaze guitars mimicked the Tiger body's weight and wood and, to an extent, the neck profile, along with a reverse hockey-stick headstock, a surface-mounted Floyd Rose vibrato system, a custom Duncan Distortion humbucker at the bridge, and an ESP single-coil at the neck. Those early ones were indeed very heavy, George reports.", '"Nowadays we think of light guitars as the way to go, and that\'s true in a lot of respects, but sometimes there\'s something about a heavy guitar that does a really, really cool thing. It has a focus to it. You lose some of the big bloomy bottom end and so on, but you do gain something—when it works. Those early Kamis had that."', 'The custom Kami guitar arrived from Japan at the ESP office in New York a few months later, into 1986. George was delighted with the result, and his Kami became the model for ESP\'s first signature guitars for an American musician. "I\'d tried to come up with something that was more in tune with my specific needs," George explains. "For example, I love having that single-coil fluid kind of legato tone at the neck, and then if I want to also just back it off, I can get a crystalline Strat sound—I know it\'s going to be in the neck, so not so bright, but still it gets you part way there."', 'He employed simple controls, too. "I had a push-pull volume—now I use push-push, but back then push-pull—and no tone, for as direct a signal as possible. I see more than one knob and I just get confused and stop playing," he says, laughing. "The wide-flat neck dimensions, too, were something that back then wasn\'t as common as now. Plus I had the personalized graphics. None of it was treading any new ground, but when you put it all together, I think it was really the predecessor to a lot of guitars that went on to try to fill that space."', "After working with ESP on the Kamikaze project for George, Matt Masciandaro was told by the company's vice president that he could have a job at ESP any time he wanted. As it happened, Matt was beginning to tire of the life of constant touring, and in 1987 he took up the offer and went to work at ESP's New York office at 151 West 19th Street. It was a fabulous time to be in the thick of things in the city.", '"The New York recording scene was probably at its peak," Matt recalls. "You had the Hit Factory, the Record Plant, Power Station, RCA, CBS. A lot of the great records of that period were recorded in the city, and a lot of artists were located there. It was a testing ground for ESP products, because we developed relationships with those artists, they\'d give us feedback on what we were making, ask us to make something special for them."', 'Vernon Reid from Living Colour was one example from those early days.', '"We worked with Vernon when the band was playing at CBGBs, about to get signed, going on tour with the Stones," Matt continues. "Well, Vernon could just take the train to 19th Street, walk into ESP, and talk about what type of guitar he wanted. Ron Wood was an early one, too. He wanted a Tele with a string-bender, which ESP was able to do, and he still plays the two he has. See, no other guitar company was located in the city, pretty much, unless it was a music store that had some sort of boutique manufacturing or repair. We were the only national guitar company located in the city."', "When Matt came on board in '87, ESP was in the process of changing its focus.", '"We were going from the original vintage guitar reproductions to creating our own identity, by making custom-color neck-through guitars with locking tremolos," he says. "We were just starting to become the guitar company that people would go to if they wanted something beyond what was traditional. I think that was the edge that we had, because people would come to us and get something that—and this might be a cliché now—that wasn\'t the guitar your father played."', 'There seemed to be a growing buzz about ESP. "Artists started to find out that if they had a vision or a concept or a dream for a guitar that wasn\'t a stock Les Paul or Strat—if they wanted a graphic on it, they wanted a Floyd Rose, they wanted custom inlays—ESP was the place to go," Matt recalls of this East Coast scene—and similar to what was happening at Charvel on the other coast. "One by one, the word would get out, whether it was Scott Ian in Anthrax who told his friend Kirk Hammett in Metallica, or whoever. The word was that ESP will make you what you want. They won\'t tell you that this is what you have to play."', "It was probably around April of '87 that Kirk and Scott showed up for their appointment at ESP in New York. At the time, the firm had about six people working in its US office, and Kirk stood among them, excited about the possibility of a good (and free) guitar. When Scott had showed Kirk his ESP, Kirk had no doubts that it was a good guitar.", '"It seemed to have a good body, nice neck, the electronics seemed to be alright, and it seemed to be somewhat solid," Kirk remembers. "So at the meeting, I asked them, well, can you make me a neck-through-body Strat-style guitar with EMG pickups? I was putting EMG pickups in all my guitars at that point." (His main guitars were a \'70s Gibson Flying V, a Jackson Randy Rhoads, and a Fernandes Strat copy.)', '"I said, well, you know, there\'s a couple other specific things I want," he continues. "I always liked the look of upside-down Strat headstocks, the Jimi Hendrix thing. So I said to them, please make it with an upside-down headstock. I wanted the heel of the neck to be beveled a little bit, as well. And if you can, I would really like it if you can get a skull-and-crossbones kind of graphic to put in the fretboard as fret markers. I also wanted 24 frets, double octave, whatever it is. A Floyd on there, as well, and I wanted two volumes and a master tone, like a Strat kind of thing. For the style of music I was playing back then, one tone knob was good enough, but I definitely needed two volume knobs."', 'Kirk took a breath, glanced up at the ESP people, and wrapped up his wants list.', '"Last, there was something I really wanted to do, but I didn\'t know if they were able to do it. I said I wanted to go through all their necks, the necks that aren\'t mounted on any guitar bodies, and just pick one out that felt right to me. So I spent like a good half-hour or so going through all the necks that they had on hand, in stock, feeling them with my left hand, feeling the radius and the fretboard and the frets. I found one that felt good, and I said can you make this neck-through-body? To me, neck-through-body guitars sounded a little bit fuller, a little bit heavier than bolt-on necks and glued-on necks."', 'Kirk looked over to Scott, wondering if he\'d asked for too much, then turned back around to check the response. "And they just said, \'Yeah, we can do all that stuff.\' I couldn\'t believe it! They were so accommodating, and I couldn\'t believe that they were actually going to do all this stuff for me. So that\'s pretty much what I ended up getting."', "A few months later, Kirk had his first ESP, delivered from the Tokyo custom shop to the New York office, exactly as he'd asked for. He was certainly playing it by the time Metallica visited Britain in August '87 to appear at the 100 Club and then the Monsters Of Rock festivals at Donington and in Germany.", 'Kirk recalls using his new ESP in the studio for the …And Justice For All sessions in early \'88. It\'s the guitar that later became known as the Zorlac, thanks to a damaged-pirate sticker (designed by Brian "Pushead" Schroeder for Zorlac skateboards) that Kirk later added to its body, and it\'s the guitar that was the basis for Kirk\'s first ESP signature model, the KH-2.', '"I remember taking it into the studio and recording a bunch of tracks with it, along with my Gibson Flying V that I\'ve had for ever and ever and ever," Kirk says. "I just fell in love with my ESP right away. The neck felt amazing, felt real even, right from the first fret all the way up to the 24th. I loved the frets, big and high. And then I remember saying hey, can I get another one to take on tour? The idea was to take one on tour and leave one at home, but I ended up taking them both on tour because they just sounded so great."', 'That second guitar is the one that became known as Caution, thanks to another sticker Kirk added later, an orange one near the controls reading "Caution Hot," along with a piece of tape above the neck pickup identifying this as Kirk\'s Guitar.', '"Those two guitars are super, super adorable!" he says of Zorlac and Caution, which collectively he calls his Skully guitars. "Made really strong, really well. I\'m hard on my instruments, it\'s the way I play, a pretty heavy right-hand technique. And the way I keep them, too. I\'m lazy: I never put a guitar back into a case. Once it\'s out of the case, it\'s out for months and months, so I can just grab it and play it. Anyway, the Zorlac is the one I wrote a bunch of riffs on. I wrote some of the stuff that ended up in \'The Unforgiven,\' the main riff from \'Enter Sandman\' was written on that guitar, as well as parts of \'Of Wolf And Man.\' So, you know, in that regard that guitar is kind of important to me."', "Matt Masciandaro says that almost every guitar that ESP has made Kirk since—and there have been many—has been based to a large extent on the Zorlac original. At the time of writing, that guitar had just come back to Kirk via ESP's current US headquarters in Los Angeles. (In 1989, ESP moved to its final New York location, on 48th Street, and Matt was put in charge of the US operation. Today he is president and CEO of the company. They moved from New York to LA in 1993.)", '"Kirk\'s Zorlac guitar had been on display at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland," Matt reports, "and Kirk asked that we could make him a reproduction of it, because he doesn\'t take this one on the road any more. It has the wear and tear, the stickers, all the things that 30 years and more on the road will get you."', 'Once ESP realized they had an avid supporter in Kirk, they continued to build him more instruments. There were some Flying Vs with EMG pickups and Deviled Ham fingerboard inlays, and a guitar with a Les Paul Junior-like body and a Pushead spider-and-web graphic. "They also gave me a blank Strat that wasn\'t finished," he says, "and I had my friend burn a bunch of stuff into it, but I think I traded that for a horror movie poster or something."', 'More striking was a series of guitars featuring colorful movie-poster graphics. The trend started in the early \'90s with a KH-2 decorated with elements from posters for the 1932 Boris Karloff film The Mummy. When the guitar arrived, with a big bold Boris between the pickups, Kirk was awestruck. "I opened up the case, I thought oh my god, it\'s as good as the movie poster—maybe even better. From that point on, I considered that guitar a fucking work of art! It started the whole movie-poster thing of me putting graphics on the guitars."', 'There were guitars with bodies that had Ouija-Board graphics, like the ones used to try to receive messages from the dead. "I thought it would be freakin\' great to put this on a guitar," Kirk says. "I got one that had glow-in-the-dark lettering, and that\'s a phenomenal thing." Does he ever get any messages? He laughs, and says: "Well, sometimes my hands will magically go to the Yes or No when I\'m working on a musical idea."', 'Kirk reckons ESP made him a guitar with a working theremin installed, one with a Randomizer effect built in, another with a Roland guitar-synth pickup. There were Wavecasters, with Tele-style clear plastic bodies made by George Fedden that contained blue oil and water, which would ebb and flow as the instrument was moved around. "I played one on tour, actually a great-sounding guitar, but when it went into storage something happened," Kirk says, "and it started to leak through one of the seams. It just became so rusted out, it wasn\'t playable any more. I do have more ideas for other ESP guitars, but these days, as Matt would say, I have to be careful not to overwhelm the custom shop."', "That long relationship between Kirk and ESP is unusual in the guitar business, although as we've seen, George Lynch has been associated with the company even longer. After his original Kamikaze guitar, George had ESP make a few more custom instruments with arresting graphics, including one he called Skulls & Snakes and also some variations on his stripey Tiger guitar. Both Kirk and George have several signature models still in the ESP line today.", 'Looking back to those early days of ESP, George reckons there was some kind of movement. "Maybe that\'s just the benefit of hindsight, but it seems there were quite a few people thinking along similar lines, and wanting that kind of guitar. A faster neck and all that, but real high quality, that was the other thing. I think some of the guitars in that \'80s era missed the mark, because although they had the hot pickups, the locking tremolo system, really fast necks, and so forth, they didn\'t really have the three-dimensional depth and quality that we loved about guitars from previous eras and generations. I think the Kamikaze and other high-end ESPs did have that—their own unique quality to their sound."', "As you might imagine, George has a sizable collection of instruments he's accumulated over the years.", '"I have 12-strings and baritones and tenor guitars—you know: whatever I need for different sounds and layering and so forth," he says. "But my core has always been ESP, that\'s my signature sound and my signature guitar relationship. They\'ve been family to me, and recently they even allowed me to do my own Mr. Scary Guitars project. So ESP have been there for me for—well, whatever that is if we count back to \'85. Not a lot of things last that long in our lifetimes! Marriages, bands, not too many things last 35 years and counting. It\'s a very healthy, productive relationship, a great symbiotic relationship."', 'Kirk, too, values this constant through what has been a long career full of the inevitable ups and downs.', '"I love that ESPs are super consistent," he says. "A lot of times I\'ll get a new one right out of the case, and I\'ll need to play at least two or three shows with it, bang on it, spit all over it, you know? And then something magical happens, and it kind of finds its voice after I do that. I guess all of those different parts need to congeal or something, for want of a better word. But it\'s crazy—all the different components come together and the guitar sounds like it should. Sometimes it\'s a bit of a wait for a new one, sometimes it can be a year, but when I get that guitar, when it finally arrives, I am so excited. You know? I am so excited."', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

Tagged as “God’s greatest hitmakers,” the Staples’ discography is testament to the profound imprint they’ve left on gospel, soul, folk, and R&B. Started by father/guitarist Roebuck “Pops” Staples in the late 1940s, the singing family used their craft to advocate for social activism, equality, and self-empowerment.', 'Influenced by guitarist Charley Patton and other seminal blues musicians, Pops started his career as a solo artist performing at community get-togethers in and around his home of Winona, Mississippi. In the 1930s, before relocating to Chicago to begin a family with his wife Oceola, he spent time singing with spiritual group the Golden Trumpets. Upon arriving in the city by the lake, he linked up with gospel sextet the Trumpet Jubilees.', 'In 1948, frustrated with the groups lack of conviction, story has it that Pops grabbed his $7 pawn-shop guitar from the closet and boldly declared, “I’m going to sing with my children.” Alongside daughters Mavis, Yvonne, and Cleotha and his son, Pervis, the Staple Singers were born.', 'Spanning a half century and more than a dozen labels, the Staples’ sound was always one step ahead of the curve. Mavis’ arresting, high-spirited lead vocals combined with Pops’ warm, unforgettable blues-tremolo guitar put them at the forefront of both secular and religious markets, creating a rare space of peace, community, and togetherness throughout severe periods of unrest in America. Songs like “Reach Out, Touch a Hand, Make a Friend” and “Respect Yourself” remain equally poignant in 2018. Today we are lucky to have Mavis sustain the messages her family sang so adamantly about.', 'Early Staples’ material consisted mainly of plantation spirituals, blues, and gospel. Another record for a local label ("Won’t You Sit Down,” on United) led to a contract with the Chicago-based Vee-Jay Records. The Staple Singers would remain at Vee-Jay from 1956 to 1963, a time period that included their breakthrough single, “Uncloudy Day.”', 'The first Staple Singers LP was marked by sparse instrumentation—just Pops’ guitar, light drumming, and stunning, rural harmonies from the family. In an interview with AARP, Bob Dylan called this album the “most mysterious thing I’ve ever heard, it was was like the fog rolling in.” Mavis, only 16 when recorded, sounds remarkably powerful. It includes the standout 1956 hit “Uncloudy Day” and “I Had a Dream.”', 'On the followup, Swing Low Sweet Chariot, Pops’ playing is top notch, and his love for the blues is coming through strong. The vocal harmonies are near-perfect and the group seem to have refined their sound and message. It includes the spiritual “Swing Low Sweet Chariot” and emotional standout “Going Away.”', 'By the early ‘60s, the Staples were pivoting away from strict gospel music and beginning to add Civil Rights–oriented protest songs to their repertoire. Referring to the work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. during an interview for their 1999 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Mavis said, “If he can preach it, we can sing it.” Dr. King, whose favorite Staples song was “Why? (Am I Treated So Bad),” set the Staples on a path of righteous activism.', "With performances at Newport Folk Festival and Carnegie Hall, the Staples also gained the attention of a predominantly white folk-music audience. Staples-style, “soul-folk” arrangements of message songs like Dylan’s “Blowin In the Wind” and Buffalo Springfield's “For What It’s Worth” solidified the group as one of the most respected artists across the great divide.", "Recorded live at Chicago’s New Nazareth Church, 1965's Freedom Highway is one of the defining albums of the Civil Rights Movement. Reissued in 2015 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery Marches, the raw power of this performance is eternal. On “Build On That Shore” and Civil Rights anthem “We Shall Overcome,” Mavis holds nothing back, her voice taking on almost supernatural powers.", 'Hearing the frenzied sounds of the congregation is a reminder that the Staples are here for the people. Despite its troubled lyrics, the title track remains of the most impassioned and uplifting in their catalog. There is nothing quite like hearing Pops and his kids singing “Marching up freedom highway / marching each and every day” together.', 'Soul Folk In Action was their first LP for Stax records and featured a notable shift in their sound. Where previous releases utilized the go-to formula of family group vocals supported by Pops’ electric guitar, Soul Folk in Action took on a full-band arrangement backed by Booker T & The MGs.', 'The secular songs chosen for this record all had socio-political messages, with the Staples transforming them into something of their own. Does it get any better than the Staples doing “The Weight”? At the time of the album’s release, Stax simultaneously signed Mavis as a solo artist and began pushing her even further into the limelight.', 'By the early ‘70s, the Staples were unstoppable as they experimented with contemporary folk, rock, soul, and even disco.', 'Between 1971 and 1975 they’d crack the Top 40 a total of eight times, crossing into the pop mainstream without losing their church credibility. Two singles hit the top of the charts—the groove-heavy, far-out “I’ll Take You There” and “Let’s Do It Again,” a soundtrack song recorded for Curtis Mayfield’s Curtom Records.', 'Featuring the infamous Muscle Shoals rhythm section and the Memphis Horns, the Staples tidied up their gentle folk-gospel and traded it for a far funkier sound.', 'Produced by Stax co-owner Al Bell, Be Altitude: Respect Yourself saw the group part ways with Pervis, making even more room for Mavis’ lead-vocal to shine. Adapting to the soul energy of Stax, it balanced modern, Southern funk without losing the bluesy gospel their fans had come to associate with the group. The album include three Top 10 R&B hits—“I’ll Take You There,” “Respect Yourself,” and “This World.”', 'Originally part of a soundtrack to a comedy film of the same name starring Jimmie “Dynamite!” Walker, Bill Cosby, and Sidney Poitier, “Let’s Do It Again” was written and produced by Curtis Mayfield and performed by the Staple Singers. By 1975, The Staple Singers had been releasing socially conscious message music for more than a decade.', 'Staying relevant meant keeping up the times, and the Staples made a bold move with the album of the same name. Much to the dismay of some of their more orthodox fans, the record introduced a far edgier, sexier side of the Staples. With Mayfield at the helm, “Let’s Do It Again” was the group’s last single to top the Billboard R&B charts.', 'Update: In the comments section below, a reader drew our attention to The Staple Singers\' version of Talking Heads\' "Slippery People," which really should be heard. It captures as much as any track the expansive and shape-shifting sound of the Staples as their career continued into the \'80s. Their 1984 version of "Slippery People" features David Byrne on guitar, and, while it wasn\'t as large of a hit as some of their previous work, it performed well on pop, R&B, and especially dance charts upon its release.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

The Sugar Hill Records\' house band Tackhead provided the grooves for "Rapper\'s Delight," "The Message," and "White Lines," while studio veteran Phil Austin, who worked with the likes of Rod Stewart and Muddy Waters, mastered The Sugar Hill Gang\'s 1979 smash "Rapper\'s Delight." Despite being recorded during the genre\'s infancy, these records sounded like the work of seasoned pros. But listening to the record\'s low-end today, the live-recorded acoustic drums and bass don\'t jump out of the speakers quite the same way drum machines and sampled breaks soon would.', 'When "Rapper\'s Delight" hit shelves, however, a proliferation of home stereos with cassette decks and an estimated 7.8 million boomboxes sold globally in 1980 led to an explosion in pause tape beats and DJ-style mixes. It was possible, albeit with great limitation, to sample without the astronomical cost of a Fairlight CMI and make a rough beat sans the expense of renting a studio and hiring musicians. As if to usher in the new era of pause button ingneuity, Afrika Islam created the classic bootleg party record "Fusion Beats Vol. 2" on a tape deck in his bedroom that same year.', 'With the price of actual samplers becoming increasingly affordable in subsequent years and the advent of cheap, limited, yet effective Casio SK-1 keyboard in 1985, sampling at low bit rates became commonplace in rap music during the 1980s.', 'Shortly after the advent of the SK-1, Public Enemy became an industry standard in gritty, dusted, and visionary sampling techniques—often preferring imperfect sounds over superior sampling technology.', 'This philosophy was prevalent on some of their biggest records. While remaking the pause tape demo of "Public Enemy No. 1" for their 1987 debut Yo! Bum Rush the Show, both Chuck D and Hank Shocklee were dissatisfied with the studio quality version. "Hank [Shocklee] and I considered it too clean," Chuck told Jeff "Chairman" Mao in a 2008 Red Bull Music Academy interview. "The breaks in the pause tape gave it that funkiness of feel and direction."', 'Shocklee found it similarly irksome to remake "Rebel Without A Pause" from It Takes A Nation To Hold Use Back with a 12-bit Akai S900 after making the original on an 8-bit Ensoniq Mirage keyboard, believing that the upgrade in technology lacked the same punch. The Bomb Squad\'s preference for grimy sonic elements would remain a constant throughout the making of Public Enemy\'s most successful albums in the late \'80s and early \'90s.', 'Around the time Chuck D used his pause button to loop Fred Wesley and the J.B.\'s "Blow Your Head" for the demo of an enduring hip-hop classic, Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest started extending sampled loops with his father\'s record collection and his parent\'s cassette deck in the mid-1980s. It wasn\'t long, however, before these trial and error sessions quickly morphed into something much more rich and complex, and by age 16 he had rough versions of many beats that wound up on Tribe\'s critically acclaimed 1990 debut, People\'s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm.', 'When his fellow Native Tongues crew members De La Soul started recording their 1989 debut 3 Feet High and Rising at Calliope Studios, Tip saw the studio sessions as a way to further his recording savvy beyond tape decks and four-tracks. "I\'d just show up at Calliope with a bag of tapes, trying to figure out how to make them come alive," he said in Brain Coleman\'s book Check The Technique.', 'It was during these sessions that engineer Shane Faber showed Tip how to use the E-Mu SP-1200 and the Akai S950, two samplers that were frequently used in tandem to produce many classic rap records over the years', "After drafting much of People's Instinctive Travels using the pause tape method, he recreated many of the beats with an E-Mu SP-12 and SP-1200 sampler—with each legendary machine sampling at a 12-bit rate.", "The pause tape aesthetic would not suffice when Tribe started working on The Low End Theory. Though the group used the 12-bit 1200 and S950 samplers to make the album's beats, pristine sound soon became much more of a focus.", 'Part of this change was due to Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Q-Tip\'s admiration for NWA\'s careful attention to detail and frenetic energy on Straight Outta Compton. As they studied Dr. Dre\'s groundbreaking production, Tip recalled being especially drawn to the use of hard-hitting low end throughout the album—a sound that was further enhanced by engineer Donovan Smith and mastering engineer "Big Bass Brian" Gardner. "What resonated was just that bottom, that bass and the drive of it," Tip told Jeff Chairman Mao in a 2013 Red Bull Music Academy interview.', "Another factor in Tribe's transition from the beloved grit of their early production to a more polished aesthetic was the group's relationship to Bob Power, who served as a mixing engineer for the Tribe's first four albums and several other Native Tongues projects. Power used a Neve 8068 console to mix The Low End Theory and helped them achieve a level of crispness and clarity that was rarely found on rap records in 1991.", "He stripped away fragments of sound that weren't central to the main sample during their studio sessions, even going as far as using a Burwyn Noise Eliminator and selected stereo components to take out the static and crackle from recorded vinyl snippets—background noises that were a frequently heard and often-appreciated textural component of sample-based rap production.", 'Many have praised Power for his outstanding feat of engineering, but he has been equally quick to cite Tribe\'s musical knowledge and elite sample stacking as critical components to the final version of The Low End Theory. "Q-Tip and Ali Shaheed were at the leading edge of a new wave where people started making elaborate musical constructions out of samples from different places that would not, and in many ways, could not, have been played by regular players," he told Carl Jacobson in a 2011 Electronic Musician interview.', 'When The Low End Theory dropped, listeners took note of the impeccably mixed songs and the effortless balance of crisp textures and heavy bass. A teenaged Havoc from Mobb Deep, who would later produce the majority of the The Infamous album with some mentoring from Q-Tip, remembered being floored by the sound. "Whatever engineer they had, Bob Power, he acoustically murdered that album," he said in a 2011 XXL interview.', "The industry's elite producers were also wowed by Tribe's trendsetting LP. Just as Dr. Dre had inspired Tip and company to craft the beats on The Low End Theory, Dre later informed Tip that the album inspired him to make The Chronic—a project that would once again elevate what rap connoisseurs expected in terms of hi-fidelity sound.", 'Though Dre had collaborated with musicians like Colin Wolfe during NWA\'s Efil4zaggin sessions, he started pushing the fusion of live instrumentation and sampling even more while working with Wolfe on Jimmy Z\'s Muzical Madness—a forgotten and eclectic 1991 non-rap release from Ruthless that Dre produced in its entirety. By the time The Chronic recording sessions started at the SOLAR Records\' studio the following year, Dre had coordinated an incredibly impressive ensemble to help bring his beats to unprecedented levels, including Colin Wolfe on bass and keys, Katisse Buckingham on flute and sax, and notable engineer/producers Greg (Gregski) Royal and Chris "The Glove" Taylor as engineers.', "Building off of different people's unique talents, Dre gave extreme thought and care to each track in his quest for a perfect beat. To get all of the elements in each production exactly right, he sat behind a SSL 4052 E mixing desk—the same desk was used on Death Row-era classics like Doggystyle and All Eyez on Me—as well as projects by Pink Floyd, Pearl Jam, and Stone Temple Pilots.", 'On the classic "Nuthin\' but a \'G\' Thang," Wolfe credited Warren G for bringing in the Leon Haywood sample that served as the basis for the song. Meanwhile, Wolfe played the bassline and the synth live, while Dre came in with the right percussion to make the production truly sing. "Dre added an 808 to the kick to make it thump harder," Wolfe told Tony Best in a 2014 Wax Poetics interview.', 'Though fair credits and the exact attribution of who produced what on The Chronic have been a long-disputed issues, Dre\'s tireless efforts to achieve the perfect final mix cannot be denied. In the years since the release of the album, Chris "The Glove" Taylor has credited Dre for his studio proficiency. "The credits say, \'mixed by Chris Taylor,\' but I admit that he mixed more of that album than I did," Taylor said in a 2012 AllHipHop.com interview. "He sat in front of those boards."', 'The importance of Dre\'s willingness to spend countless hours in front of those boards cannot be overstated, as the album now remains an industry standard of perfectly produced, mixed, and mastered rap production—even though it came out nearly three decades ago. "The Chronic is still the hip-hop equivalent to Stevie Wonder\'s Songs in the Key of Life," Kanye West wrote in a 2005 article for Rolling Stone. "It\'s the benchmark you measure your album against if you\'re serious."', "Dre's west coast peer DJ Quik also deserves credit for bringing increased focus to hi-fidelity sound during the early '90s. On his 1991 debut Quik Is The Name, the multi-talented MC and producer employed a variety of elements to get optimal clarity in his beats.", 'In its first iteration, however, the album had more in common with Tribe\'s early pause tape demos than The Chronic. "I recorded it on a Tascam four-track," Quik told Keith Murphy in a 2011 Vibe interview. "I did all the over-dubs, all the blending, and mixed it down on one of those Maxwell metal tapes they used to sell."', 'When Profile records caught wind of the album, however, a bidding war ensued that ended with them signing Quik and giving him $30,000 to mix the album in a professional setting. As the album was mixed again, Quik played beats out of the SP-1200 and redid cuts on the turntables live in the studio. He also employed the legendary behind the scenes talents of Stan "The Guitar Man" Jones on bass and guitar to add some extra low end to his beats.', 'Quik\'s The Name received an additional sonic shot in the arm from the mastering services of Howie Weinberg, whose credits include Thin Lizzy, Rush, Rod Stewart, and countless others. This careful attention to all facets of album creation has been a constant throughout Quik\'s career, as he also brought Straight Outta Compton mastering engineer "Big Bass Brian" Gardner into the fold for his 2011 critical success The Book of David.', 'Though Quik recorded the first version of his platinum debut on a four-track, he later emphasized the importance of working in professional studios, even pointing out the benefits of studio power sources vs. consumer sources. "In real recording studios, they condition their power so the power is clean," he said in a 2005 Scratch interview. "You don\'t get spikes or fluctuations that cause anomalies in your equipment, which end up affecting your sound."', '', "Though skilled live musicians, accomplished recording, mixing, and mastering engineers, and professional studios were not new to rap music in the early 90s, these elements certainly played a pivotal role in the creation of engineering and production masterpieces like The Low End Theory, The Chronic, and Quik's The Name. These albums ushered in a new decade for the genre while setting a high bar of sound quality that influenced the next generation of producers like Havoc and Kanye West.", "It's easy to simplify what goes into mixing, mastering, and producing a rap record, but the process is much more complex than most people realize. Q-Tip and A Tribe Called Quest, Dr. Dre, and DJ Quik, were able to incorporate the raw sonics of low bit sampling into their definitive masterworks while polishing each production to give them a timeless quality—one that continues to influence and inspire today.", 'About the author: Gino Sorcinelli is the writer, creator, and editor of Micro-Chop, a Substack newsletter that dissects beatmaking, DJing, music production, rapping, and sampling.

There, Lee Dorsey opened a bustling auto repair business and sang in clubs at night, winding up with a recording career at the age of 35.', 'In Dorsey’s inimitable voice, the inherent carnival of New Orleans nightlife can be heard, as well as a trait that no doubt helped him in the ring, a sense of buoyancy and indomitability in the face of adversity.', '', 'In 1961, Dorsey was introduced to Allen Toussaint, a pianist in the New Orleans boogie-woogie lineage of masters like Huey “Piano” Smith and Professor Longhair.', 'By then, Toussaint was already in the business of penning R&B classics like “Mother-in-Law” and “Fortune Teller”—songs that would go on to be covered by the likes of the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Yardbirds, and more.', 'And while Toussaint had a formidable stable of talent, from the eccentric Ernie K. Doe to the Soul Queen of New Orleans, Irma Thomas, Dorsey’s gifts stood apart. “He had a happy voice and he wasn’t too cool to sing a humorous song,” Toussaint said of the singer.', 'Despite nearing middle age, the spry and youthful Dorsey took direct inspiration from playground skip-a-rope chants for a string of early singles: “Do-Re-Mi,” “Shortnin’ Bread,” “Eenie-Meenie-Minee-Mo” and “Ya Ya.” In 1961, “Ya Ya” hit the Billboard top ten, moved a million copies and became a gold disc. No more hits followed, so Dorsey just went back to his shop, while Toussaint wound up drafted in the army for two years, discharged in 1965.', 'Dorsey then climbed the charts again with a decidedly more grown—but no less playful—tune. Penned by Toussaint and backed by a band of incredibly in-the-pocket, second-line players known as the Meters, “Ride Your Pony” remains a strip club anthem without peer.', 'Dorsey, Toussaint, and the Meters proved to be a potent triumvirate of Naw’lins power. From there, Dorsey would be the main vocal conduit for the prolific pen, production, and piano playing of Allen Toussaint, with songs like “Get Out of My Life Woman” and “Holy Cow” following.', 'Clanging metal on metal lent “Working in the Coalmine” a distinct chiming, mechanistic groove and gave Dorsey another Top 10 single, its hammering beat ringing through new wave and even country, covered by the likes of Devo and the Judds. Dorsey could bop and weave through such rhythms, humorous and spot-on with his interjections, which once led critic Robert Christgau to gauge Dorsey “as much a percussion instrument as JB, only funnier.”', 'Dig through any of his late ‘60s singles—even on songs that didn’t become staples—Dorsey always hits: the sweetness of his duet with Betty Harris on “Love Lots of Lovin’” and his own “Candy Yam,” the slinky funk sitar of “Give It Up,” the breakbeat fury of “Four Corners,” the daily affirmation of “Everything I Do Gonh Be Funky (From Now On).”', "New Orleans music always enjoyed a bit of distance from the rest of the world, with life moving a little slower in the Big Easy and that laid-back feeling permeating every aspect of the city's sound. But as the volatile ‘60s bled into the ‘70s and civil rights and black pride came to the fore in the work of James Brown, Nina Simone, Marvin Gaye, and the Temptations, even the vivacity of New Orleans funk allowed for some deeper insight.", 'And with Dorsey’s 1970 album Yes We Can, Toussaint provided one of the most empowering anthems in his mighty songbook, crafting a towering achievement in New Orleans music with Dorsey on the microphone and the Meters backing him up.', 'Decades before it echoed through the presidential campaign of Barack Obama, "Yes We Can" finds Dorsey at his most sagacious and optimistic leading into the chorus: “I know we can make it work/ I know we can make it if we try.” Even in the midst of the era’s upheaval, Lee Dorsey’s voice soothes while the bouncing beat, swells of organ, and triumphant horns all reinforce the positive message without a hint of false hope or disbelief in a good outcome.', "The rest of the album is just as joyous and affirmative. “Riverboat” transforms the Meters into a steam room, all bleating horns, hissing hi-hats, and drums that churn like pistons, while the wah guitar eddies alongside the titular boat and Dorsey floats across the song. He sings of the overwhelming bigness of life, as well as the grain of love that counterbalances it all, riding out the tumultuousness that “on land they're fighting man to man” with love.", 'The rest of the album wonders about heartbreak, poverty and paying bills, the disappointing side of human nature, failure, and more. But Toussaint’s arrangements remain light throughout, the Meters lay down the most liquid of rhythms, and the esprit of Dorsey infuses it all with sweet sanguinity.', 'While the title track dented the singles charts, Yes We Can as an album didn’t and the faltering sales led Dorsey back to his auto repair business. But his influence could be heard on the likes of the Band, Robert Palmer, John Lennon, and Van Dyke Parks, who would cover two songs for his 1972 album Discover America. And in 1980, the Clash brought Lee Dorsey out on tour with them.', 'In two years time, Dorsey himself would be gone. But for all the punches that Lee Dorsey took—in life or in his songs—his music never once loses its footing or goes down.', 'On his best singles, he conveys a sound of joy. “If a smile had a sound, it would be the sound of Lee Dorsey’s voice,” Allen Toussaint once said. “No wonder he inspired so many of my favorite songs.” Forever a boxer, Dorsey remains deft and undefeatable. “Another failure, another try,” as he reminds us on “O Me-O My-O.” “Just keep on pushing.”', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

In the early 1950s, Cooke was the divine voice fronting the Soul Stirrers, the mighty gospel quartet whose harmonies influenced everything from doo-wop to Motown. The young Mayfield followed in his footsteps with his first group, Northern Jubilee Gospel Singers.', 'And when Cooke pivoted from the church to pop, Mayfield also took note. He too would transition from sacred music to secular stardom, becoming one of soul music\'s enduring icons, but Mayfield made sure to safeguard his legacy early on in his career. "When my father started recording in 1958, no Negro artist [owned their work]," his son Todd Mayfield wrote in Traveling Soul, his biography of his father, but Curtis looked to the example of Sam Cooke\'s SAR Records, which the singer started in 1961. "Already one of Dad\'s heroes in music, Cooke became his hero in business, too. Dad followed in Cooke\'s footsteps and founded his own publishing company. He called it Curtom."', 'Curtom would soon become one of the most vital record labels of the late \'60s, run by Mayfield and Eddie Thomas, its name a melding of their names. And while Cooke never recorded for his label (instead using it to promote other artists), Mayfield handled Curtom\'s daily business, was its main A&R, and wrote and produced albums for its many acts—all while being its biggest-selling artist. For the first half of the \'70s they had one of the most successful black independent labels this side of Detroit. "Own yourself, own yourself, own yourself," was Mayfield\'s mantra, his son recalled. "Curtom made him a titan. He\'d done what a black man in America wasn\'t supposed to do—snatched control from a system designed to subjugate him."', "Mayfield remains a singular talent in pop music, his gifts still not properly perceived and revered in the culture. His aching falsetto and politically aware songs kindled a fire in Bob Marley, his adroit and awe-inspiring guitar work heavily influenced Jimi Hendrix, while his way with a beat has made him a foundation of hip-hop, sampled numerous times by Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar. Mayfield knew his worth though and saw firsthand how labels pilfer from their artists, how they paid pennies on the dollar for smash hits, taking the publishing with them. And while Mayfield's first two imprints, Windy C and Mayfield, suffered from distribution problems, with Curtom, he finally took control of his fate.", '"Black Power\'s emphasis on economic autonomy resonated with Mayfield\'s determination to control his music," Craig Werner wrote in Higher Ground, and his increased social consciousness in turn powered his songwriting and business dealings. With his band The Impressions, Mayfield\'s pen led to songs that inspired and empowered their audience, such as "Keep On Pushing," "People Get Ready," and their 1967 hit, "We\'re A Winner." It also led the group to leave their label, ABC-Paramount, for Curtom. "We were trying to equalize things," Thomas said of the label and its roots in Black Power. "That was our whole policy cause we were not equal, we were stuck down at the bottom and no matter what happened, we stayed there. That\'s why we were fighting to get up."', 'In 1970, Mayfield went solo. His first five solo albums all made the Top 40: His debut, Curtis, went Top 20, Curtis Live spent 38 weeks in the Top 100, and with his soundtrack for blacksploitation classic, Superfly, Curtis reached No. 1. Such success allowed Mayfield to move his mother out of the Cabrini-Green projects and provide for his extended family. At the label\'s pinnacle, Mayfield did it all—head writer, producer, A&R man, CEO, president, and star artist. But while he envisioned a Motown-like level of success, it was basically a one-man show: "My father pulled off the staggering task of creating an entire record label\'s worth of music by himself," Todd Mayfield says.', 'Yet outside of his own iconic songs, Curtis\'s magic touch never quite extended to the other artists on his roster. So while he recognized the genius of Donny Hathaway and released his earliest singles on Curtom, it was only when Hathaway went to Atlantic that he became a star. In trying to help out old friends like Major Lance, Gene Chandler, and Billy Butler, the only one to taste the R&B Top 20 was Major Lance\'s "Stay Away from Me." In signing the family group the Five Stairsteps, Mayfield anticipated the future success of other family acts like the Jackson 5 and the Osmonds.', 'Mayfield knew what he had and produced lush soul albums like the group\'s 1968 LP Love\'s Happening, which Craig Werner called "a weirdly appealing combination of flower-power musings and gospel-bubblegum production." That album boasts one of hip-hop\'s foundational breaks in the form of "Don\'t Change Your Love," sampled by A Tribe Called Quest, Common, De La Soul, LL Cool J, Pete Rock, and many others. But the band could never break through commercially on Curtom. Ironically, it was only when Mayfield\'s workload kept him from working with the band—leading them to move over to the Buddah imprint—that they finally achieved soul ubiquity with 1970\'s "O-o-h Child."', "Mayfield also knew he had a star with the mighty-voiced Baby Huey. If the 400-pound soul belter hadn't succumbed to a drug-related heart attack at the age of 26, he might have become a superstar on the imprint. As it was, Mayfield produced the posthumous The Baby Huey Story: The Living Legend, which didn't sell well upon its release. But it too would become a hip-hop staple, its breaks powering everyone from Eric B. & Rakim and A Tribe Called Quest to Ice Cube and Ghostface Killah.", 'But while Mayfield might have anticipated hip-hop, as the \'70s went on, he stubbornly did everything he could to avoid bowing to the unrelenting rhythms of disco. As R&B, soul, and funk all became absorbed in it, Curtis Mayfield and Curtom found themselves on the outside looking in as disco took over dancefloors, black radio, and the pop charts. Only Linda Clifford, Mayfield\'s sometime duet partner, had measurable success with "If My Friends Could See Me Now" and "Runaway Love."', 'Even Mayfield\'s film scores finally faltered during the \'70s. While Mayfield had chart success working with soul queens like Gladys Knight and the Pips, Aretha Franklin, and Mavis Staples on various soundtracks, in 1977, under the long shadow of Star Wars, the gritty prison film Short Eyes—with a deep Mayfield soundtrack—failed at the box office and on the charts, nearly bankrupting Curtom. He enlisted Mavis Staples for his second movie soundtrack, A Piece of the Action, but that film was eclipsed by Saturday Night Fever and the rise of disco. Mayfield took his own half-hearted stabs at disco, with Do It All Night and Heartbeat. And while those albums offer some sweet moments (check out the exquisite "In Love, In Love, In Love" and the space disco stomp of "What Is My Woman For?"), Mayfield couldn\'t adapt to the changing trends and by 1980, Curtom formally ceased operations.', '"I had the ambition to want to be rich like Motown and Berry Gordy, I was striving for that like you can\'t believe," Mayfield told The Face in 1983. "But it took a little bit more than I could handle myself to make another Motown. It just wasn\'t in the cards for one man to run a publishing company, be a recording artist, and be a producer." Curtom may have faltered, but its example lives on. Rappers not only sample Mayfield\'s music, but model their own labels on the example of Curtom. One need only look to the massive success of P. Diddy\'s Bad Boy, Jay-Z\'s Roc-A-Fella, Rick Ross\'s MMG or Kanye\'s G.O.O.D. Music to see that there is immeasurable power for such African-American artists, provided that you "own yourself."', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

The initial inkling of the process became visible via an astonishing appearance on BBC television\'s Old Grey Whistle Test in 1973, yet the Wailers had been recording for nearly a decade before their Island debut and much of the output is simply astounding in its excellence.', 'Throughout the 1960s and into the early \'70s, the Wailers evidenced a lot of concerted evolution that greatly influenced the course of Jamaican popular music itself, from their time as ska kings at Studio One, contrasting with the slim self-produced rock steady they cut for their fledgling Wail \'n Soul \'m label, and on to the revolutionary reggae they recorded with external producers such as Leslie Kong, Danny Sims, and Lee "Scratch" Perry.', "Here's a brief guide to the various distinctive phases that pre-date the Island breakthrough.", 'The Wailers reached Studio One as an unruly five-piece in late 1963, having been introduced to founder Clement "Sir Coxsone" Dodd by percussionist Alvin "Seeco" Patterson. The group\'s lead singer was then Junior Braithwaite, and female backing vocalists Beverley Kelson and Cherry Green were sometime members, but the lineup was soon pared down to the robust core of Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, and Bunny Livingstone, their exceptional harmonic skills being equalled by their original songwriting abilities.', 'From the recording of debut hit "Simmer Down," one of the very first songs to address Kingston\'s growing phenomenon of "rude boy" street gang violence, the Wailers swiftly became one of the hottest groups of the ska period. Hit followed hit for the next few years, but by the time that the slower and more spacious rock steady style came in, the Wailers ultimately opted for self-reliance, ditching Dodd to take a stab at things on their own.', 'Clement Dodd productions: "Simmer Down," "It Hurts To Be Alone/I Am Going Home," "Rasta Shook Them Up," The Birth of a Legend, The Wailing Wailers at Studio One', "Frustrated by monetary arrangements at Studio One, the Wailers tried to gain better control of their financial and artistic destinies in 1966 by forming the Wail 'n Soul 'm label, the name referencing The Wailers and The Soulettes, the latter being the harmony group fronted by Bob's wife, Rita. Ever a grassroots affair, with something of a haphazard feel about it due to a lack of infrastructure, Wail 'n Soul 'm only issued material sporadically for the next few years, yet pretty much everything on it is worth tracking down.", 'The mellow rock steady of "Nice Time"was something of a local hit in Jamaica, and later recordings, such as Peter Tosh\'s "Funeral," are far more anti-establishment in theme. There were also some intriguing instrumentals, such as "Lyrical Satirical," which evidenced a keen Rastafari underpinning that hearkens to the ancestral African homeland. Collectively, these Wail \'n Soul \'m nuggets can be seen as crucial stepping stones in the group\'s long and tumultuous career, bridging the gap by helping them to reach more solid ground as artists and music producers.', 'Self-produced Wail \'n Soul \'m releases: "Nice Time/Hypocrites," Wail \'n Soul \'m Singles Selecta', 'The black Texan balladeer Johnny Nash first decamped to Jamaica in 1967 with his shrewd manager, Danny Sims, to record some tracks at Federal recording studio. Returning to the Island the following year, Sims encountered Marley at a Rastafarian "groundation" ceremony and instantly recognised his enormous potential. A songwriting deal was soon struck with the Wailers, who recorded dozens of tracks for the company during a period of flux that saw Bunny Livingstone imprisoned on a marijuana charge (with Rita Marley temporarily taking his place) and Marley spending a long stretch at his mother\'s home in Delaware.', 'Precious little surfaced at the time of recording, and despite the commercial nature of tracks like "Reggae On Broadway," the little that did get released failed to hit. Nevertheless, the recordings are compelling to listen to in retrospect, forming another piece of the convoluted Wailers puzzle.', 'JAD productions: "Chances Are," "Reggae On Broadway," Chances Are, Complete Bob Marley and the Wailers 1967-1972 Part 1, Mellow Mood', "The Wailers were hoping for a major breakthrough with JAD, but progress was painfully slow. The company seemed more content to have Nash make regular use of Marley's lyrics, rather than issue the group's own recordings. As the years wore on and nothing much concrete transpired, the Wailers began working for other Jamaican producers and since Marley was always listening out for who was responsible for the most hits, an album's worth of material was cut for Leslie Kong of Beverley's Records, who issued it under the confusing title The Best of the Wailers, much to the group's displeasure.", 'Nevertheless, the funk and soul-influenced backing of the All Stars house band on tracks like "Soul Shakedown Party" and the Tosh-led "Soon Come" gave the material plenty of appeal. And as with most of the output that originates from Kong\'s stable, it has all certainly stood the test of time.', 'Leslie Kong productions: "Soon Come," The Best Of The Wailers, Shakedown, Reggae Revolution Vol 1.', 'The eccentric and enigmatic producer Lee "Scratch" Perry first began working with the Wailers at Studio One in the early 1960s. Ever on the lookout for the right connection that would facilitate a significant breakthrough, Marley appealed to Perry at the dawning of the 1970s, seeking to record new work for the wily producer at a time when all other avenues were blocked. The combination was simply exceptional and under Perry\'s guidance, the Wailers totally reconfigured their sound, making it much more raw, honest, and Jamaican, and ultimately preparing them for the international stardom they would achieve upon signing with Island. Marley lived for an extended period in Perry\'s front room, cementing an unbreakable bond.', 'Songs like "Duppy Conqueror," "Mr Brown," "Small Axe," and "Kaya"are immortal, as is Tosh\'s "400 Years" and Bunny\'s "Dreamland," the collective work remaining among the best that the group recorded for any producer, and the best that Perry produced with any artist too.', 'Lee Perry productions: "Duppy Conqueror," "Mr Brown," "Small Axe," Soul Rebels, Soul Revolution, Soul Revolution I and II', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

The drum kit, which would soon become a central instrument to the genre, had yet to be invented. It would start with a kick pedal.', 'While other inventors had already created their own early bass drum–playing pedals, they would often be used only to strike a bass drum and a cymbal at the same time. But Edward "Dee Dee" Chandler saw their real potential: freeing up your hands to play your snare, cymbals, and bass simultaneously.', "As Samuel Charters writes in Jazz: New Orleans 1885–1957 (quoted in New Orleans' The Times-Picayune), Chandler made his own kick pedal:", '"Chandler took a standard brass band bass drum and bolted a piece of spring steel on the top of it, bent so that the loose end of the spring was over the center of the drum head and a few inches away from it. ... He put a covered block of wood on the loose end so that the block would hit the drum head if the spring were bent."', '"On the floor he put a hinged wooden pedal, cut out of a Magnolia Milk Company carton he\'d gotten from the King Grocery where he worked, with a chain stretched from the raised end of the pedal to the end of the spring. When he stepped on the pedal the chain pulled the block against the drum head, and when he released the pedal the spring pulled the block back. He tied a trap drum onto the side of the bass drum with rope."', 'Chandler worked all over the city—from Storyville brothels to high-end hotels—and he was incredibly popular with other drummers.', 'As Smithsonian Folkways writes, "He was considered by other drummers to be one of the best of his time, an, \'excellent showman and comic,\' who \'played with the grace of a professional juggler.\' His drums were tuned in a distinctly sharp way that \'made the drum roll sound like he was tearing a piece of cloth.\'"', 'In such descriptions, you can almost hear his drumming—a modern force that no doubt influenced a great number of the drummers who saw him play. His self-made kick pedal was crude and "the sound was probably erratic," as Chambers writes, "but Chandler was a sensation and was widely imitated."', "By the 1930s, jazz had thoroughly taken over American popular music, and swing bands like Benny Goodman's and Count Basie's were the biggest entertainers of the day.", "Prior to Charlie Christian, though, a guitarist's role in a swing band was to play rhythm. Acoustic guitars were still very much the norm, though some pioneering electric players like Sidney Bechet's Leonard Ware, Big Bill Broonzy's George Barnes, and Bob Wills' Eldon Shamblin were starting to change that, with weeping, electrified steel guitar taking off as well.", 'But in an era dominated by horn soloists, no guitarist had yet emerged that could hold his own with a hard, clear tone and the masterful soloing to match. Like Dee Dee Chandler, Christian would fashion his own instrument and set the jazz world on fire.', "In his biography of John Hammond, The Producer, author Dunstan Prial recounts the first night the Columbia producer and record industry maven saw Christian perform, with an otherwise amateurish band in Oklahoma City. He quotes from Hammond's own reported account:", '"Charlie ... had put a pickup on a regular Spanish guitar and hooked it up to a primitive amp and a twelve-inch speaker. ... He used amplification sparingly when playing rhythm but turned it up for his solos, which were as exciting improvisations as I had ever heard on any instrument, let alone the guitar. He was carrying on his shoulders a pretty sad combo, including his brother and some other Texans, but the contrast between the never-ending inspiration of Charlie and the mere competence of the others was the most startling I had ever heard. Before an hour had passed, I was determined to place Charlie with Benny Goodman, primarily as a spark for the depleted Goodman quartet.', 'Despite the efforts of other electric guitarists to gain a foothold, the prevailing wisdom, from Goodman\'s perspective at least, was Who needs them? When Hammond told Goodman he should hire Christian immediately, Goodman responded, "Who the hell wants to hear an electric guitar player?"', 'Luckily for guitarists everywhere, Hammond persisted and got Christian an audition. Once Goodman heard the same wondrous playing, Christian was brought on as a full-time member of the Benny Goodman Sextet and Orchestra. His modern soloing set the template for nearly all guitarists that followed.', 'In the highly creative atmosphere of The Bronx in the 1970s, hip-hop innovations were coming in quick succession. And two towering figures, each in their own way, set the course for a brand-new way of making music.', "DJ Kool Herc famously threw the first hip-hop party at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue one night in August 1973, with many more to follow. Through his record selections and a new technique for isolating drum breaks, he turned the apartment building rec room into a DIY disco with a new music as its soundtrack. Using two of the same records, he'd find the rhythm-forward passages of his favorite soul and funk records, and spin them back-to-back, elongating the breaks for as long as he wanted.", 'Another pioneering DJ, GrandMixer DXT, recalled Herc\'s early technique in the documentary series Hip-Hop Evolution: "I had never seen anyone have two copies of a record and keep going back to the part where we normally would pick the needle up and put it back so there\'s this silence for a minute—now that was continuous. He called it the \'Merry-Go-Round.\'"', "It was proto-sampling years before there'd be an easy way to isolate beats. But other aspiring hip-hop DJs would soon learn that—barring some preternatural gift for finding the right groove in vinyl—it was still incredibly difficult to change from record-to-record and song-to-song. So in turn, Grandmaster Flash developed a technique that built on Herc's foundation.", 'Flash perfected the art of making clean transitions and edits by stopping the records by hand, and using crayons to mark the entry point of the breaks.', 'It was this marriage of technique and technology that would make turntables into the premier instrument of early hip-hop—enabling not just fluid playback but further creative manipulation of sound as well.', "While interviewed in Hip-Hop Evolution, author and music historian Nelson George puts Flash's use of the turntables in the context of the earlier pioneering steps of black musicians:", '"The idea that this technology is not simply something to play the record—that I can play the technology. To me, it\'s in a tradition of great black music," George says. "You know, the saxophone\'s a classical instrument that\'s not really essential to the classical canon, but it was taken by black musicians, who make it into the central instrument of jazz. The electric guitar. You know, Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry. They made it into some new thing. And I feel the same way about Grandmaster Flash, because the turntables were made into an instrument."', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Okay, more like an extremely rare event.', 'And even though the word "rare" can be overused in describing guitars, the Gretsch White Penguin deserves that moniker. It is, indeed, rare; the Holy Grail of Gretsch guitars. Why? Because only a handful were produced over a span of a few years, it was an expensive guitar even when new, and far more is not known about the mysterious Gretsch Model 6134 than is known.', "Only a few dozen White Penguins have surfaced over the years and on the rare occasion (there's that word again) that one does come up for sale, prices are in the six figures. Pink Floyd's David Gilmour bought a very clean 1958 White Penguin for his personal collection back in 1980. It recently sold at auction for $447,000, a new record paid for a Gretsch guitar.", 'Just like the Gretsch 6121 is a matching solidbody version of the orange, G-Branded, Western-themed Chet Atkins Hollowbody Model 6120, the White Penguin is a solidbody companion to its hollowbodied big brother, the flashy and gold-sparkled White Falcon.', 'The Jet\'s 13.5" wide, single-cutaway body consists of a heat-pressed contoured maple top glued to a heavily-chambered mahogany base. Although Jets were marketed as a solidbody, they were more of a semi-solidbody in reality.', 'The Penguin and White Falcon had many of the same glitzy components: gold-plated hardware, jeweled G-Arrow control knobs, gold sparkle binding from Gretsch\'s drum department, and a smaller version of the classy "G" Cadillac tailpiece. Plus like its big brother, the White Penguin was painted with multiple coats of hand-rubbed glossy white lacquer but used white Nitron drum material on the headstock surface. (This explains why many vintage White Penguin and White Falcon painted bodies have yellowed with age to a cream color, while their headstocks remain a bright white.)', 'And speaking of headstocks, because the White Penguin used the large, wide, V-shaped White Falcon headstock instead of the narrow headstock found on Gretsch Jet models, it appears a limited batch of guitar cases were manufactured for the White Penguin. As you can imagine, original examples of these cases are rare as well.', 'Unfortunately, there are no surviving records of how many White Penguins actually left the Gretsch factory in Brooklyn. Since they were probably produced during the small batch runs of White Falcons, Gretsch guitar and production guru, Ed Ball, speculates that perhaps fewer than 50 White Penguins were made from 1956 to 1962 (with only a handful featuring the Project-O-Sonic stereo option) before the Model 6134 was quietly retired and reassigned to the inexpensive solidbody Corvette model.', "Regarding the marketing of the White Penguin, it doesn't appear Gretsch put much effort into promoting their third-most expensive guitar behind the White Falcon and Chet Atkins Country Gentleman. The White Penguin listed for a whopping $490 in 1959 compared to $265 for a Cherry Sunburst Gibson Les Paul.", "Gretsch's rare bird never appeared in a catalog, was only mentioned briefly in a 1958 brochure, and was only seen in a few price lists in the '50s. It was also never played by any big-named artists of the era or featured on an album cover, and no photos have surfaced of it being shown off at any trade shows. There's even speculation that the few White Penguins produced were actually custom orders from dealers. Again, we'll probably never know.", "Good question. It's anybody's guess why a cuddly, aquatic flightless bird was chosen as the name for a high-end guitar (and was even featured in outline form on the guitar's pickguard). Perhaps Jimmie Webster, the creator of the White Falcon and Gretsch's main guitar designer, knew about the rarity of all-white penguins in the wild and saw the irony of naming his limited-production guitar after these rare, elusive birds. Just add this to the growing list of many yet-to-be-answered questions about vintage White Penguins.", "During its initial run, three generations of White Penguins were produced and, for the most part, mirrored the White Falcon in regard to electronics, hardware, and pizzazz. The first generation of '56-'57 Penguins featured dual DeArmond Dynasonic single-coil pickups, a Melita bridge, and feather-engraved mother-of-pearl hump-block markers on a bound ebony fretboard.", 'The second generation of \'58-\'61 Penguins followed Gretsch\'s 1958 switch to humbucking Filter\'Tron pickups, the new Space Control bridge, Neo-Classic Thumbnail fretboard markers on a bound ebony fretboard, a 3-position tone switch added to the upper bout, and a gold-sparkled horizontal block-letter Gretsch "T-Roof" logo on the headstock.', "The third generation of '61-'62 Penguins were the lowest quantity produced and followed the new double-cutaway body style that appeared on most of the Gretsch guitar lineup. Other additions included a standby switch and a gold-plated Burns, not Bigsby, vibrato unit.", 'After more than 30 years of retirement, the White Penguin surfaced again for a brief return in 1993–1994 and has been a regular member of the Gretsch lineup since 2003. The Penguin line has been expanded over the years to include an all-black Black Penguin model and even a parlor-sized White Penguin Rancher acoustic/electric guitar.', 'Currently, Gretsch offers a \'58 White Penguin as part of their Vintage Select Professional Series. With TV Jones Filter\'Tron Classic pickups and a gold Bigsby, today\'s Penguin is a flashy, faithful recreation of the 1958 model that Gretsch describes as "a finely crafted new take on that rarest of Gretsch birds."', "Penguins are also a popular model requested at the Gretsch Custom Shop. Dozens of one-off Penguins in every color and configuration imaginable have been created over the past 15 years. It's ironic that probably more custom Penguins have been produced than the actual number of original White Penguins.", "Authentic, vintage White Penguins occasionally come up for sale and sometimes even make appearances at guitar shows. You can also see two of the rarest White Penguins, a '58 Project-O-Sonic Stereo model and a double-cutaway '62 model, on display at the impressive Songbirds Guitar Museum in Chattanooga, Tennessee.", 'With more questions than answers, the elusive Gretsch White Penguin will probably continue increasing in price and being shrouded in mystery. More than sixty years after its quiet birth and "retirement," it\'s still anybody\'s guess how many White Penguins were actually made, how many survived, and when any of these elusive birds will surface again for air.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Earlier that year, Stan Rendell was promoted to president of Gibson. He replaced Albert Stanley, who in turn had replaced Ted McCarty in 1966. He'd worked for Gibson's parent company, CMI, since 1963 and by '68 was in charge of all CMI's manufacturing.", 'Stan had become tired of constant traveling between CMI\'s factories, and his boss at CMI, Maurice Berlin, suggested the top job at Gibson. Stan agreed, but he\'d taken on quite a challenge. Maurice told Stan that Gibson was suffering, that it had lost a million dollars at the factory for two years running. Stan\'s brief was the daunting one handed to most incoming presidents: "Make sure you improve the company\'s fortunes."', 'At the Gibson plant in Kalamazoo, Stan soon found out what he and his team were up against. "We had all kinds of quality problems. We had production problems. We had personnel problems," he told me. "We had union problems. We had problems that wouldn\'t end." Stan set to work. He developed a structure for supervision in the factory, he brought in manufacturing schedules, improved inspection routines, installed a separate stock room, and held regular meetings.', '"We bought a ton of new equipment, too, all sorts of stuff," Stan recalled. "Mr. Berlin said that in the first five years I was there, there were more new ideas, new machinery, and new products than in the entire history of the Gibson company prior to that. We just had a ball. And if we didn\'t know how to do something, we found out."', 'In 1968, the year Stan arrived, Gibson was still touting the relatively new SG as its prime solidbody electric. As far as the company was concerned, this modern design with its sculpted double-cutaway body had replaced the old-style single-cut Les Pauls. Some notable guitarists were by now arguing otherwise. Jeff Beck, Michael Bloomfield, Eric Clapton, Billy Gibbons, Peter Green, and Keith Richards, to name a few, had discovered the charm and power of the old Les Pauls.', "Another recent arrival at Gibson was guitarist Bruce Bolen, who joined in 1967 to organize and perform promotional shows as a roving player for the company. Over the coming years he would take on more responsibility in guitar design and marketing. Back in '67 when he joined Gibson, Bruce too recognized a company in relatively poor condition.", '"One of the reasons I was hired was because Gibson\'s electric sales were floundering," he told me. "All we had in solidbody electrics were SGs, plus the archtop and thinline instruments, and they weren\'t selling all that well. The mainstay of the company at the time was the flattop acoustics. So I was hired, basically, to go out and sell electric guitars."', 'Bruce found the managers at Gibson and CMI unaware of the growing respect among rock guitarists for the original Les Pauls. "I was just a punk kid, and most of the people there were in their fifties or older," he recalled. "I don\'t think they had a great grasp on how important that guitar was becoming once again. Mike Bloomfield, Eric Clapton, guys like that—they\'d found it to be something really precious that offered a sound that was very conducive to their form of music."', 'Jeff Hasselberger, who joined the new Ibanez company in the States in the early \'70s, took a professional interest in the culture at the big brands of the day. "This new accent on old models became obvious to us at Ibanez," Jeff said. "We knew, from the music, if we saw Jimmy Page walk on stage with a Telecaster, or maybe Jeff Beck, we knew that\'s what we had to do at Ibanez, or if they came out with a Les Paul, then Les Pauls would be hot. I don\'t think Gibson and Fender were following those things closely or even knew who those people were in a lot of cases. You\'d go to the Gibson party at the trade shows and it would be all their jazzer pals—Barney Kessel, Howard Roberts, those kind of guys."', 'Soon after Bruce Bolen started at Gibson, vice president Marc Carlucci one day asked if he\'d mind staying late that evening at the CMI headquarters in Chicago. "Marc told me they had someone coming in and wanted my opinion on what he had to show us," Bruce recalled. "I asked who it was, and he told me it was Les Paul. Now, when I was a kid, six years old, Les Paul was my first guitar hero, so I was thrilled to have the chance to meet him. Gibson still wasn\'t too sure they wanted to reintroduce the Les Paul guitar. I was going: Please!"', "Les Paul had been quiet musically since the mid '60s, but in '67 he released Les Paul Now, his first album for some time. This meeting that same year marked the start of a new association with Gibson and the beginning of the reissue program for Les Paul models. Les' recollection of the circumstances was typically imaginative.", '"I called Gibson," Les told me, "and said, \'Hey, Fender\'s here bugging me and they want to make a deal, and my divorce is over.\' I asked if Gibson wanted to make a deal. And Mr. Berlin said it was odd that I should call, because they were striking all electrical instruments from the Gibson line. He told me the electric guitar was extinct. So I asked if he could meet me that Friday in Chicago. I said I wanted to buy him a cup of coffee. We stayed up for 24 hours, and I convinced him to go back and make the electric guitar."', 'Maybe the CMI boss really was thinking about "striking all electrical instruments from the Gibson line," but there\'s little evidence the company contemplated such a drastic move. Gibson certainly negotiated a new contract with Les. They agreed a royalty of five percent of the "standard cost" of each of the proposed Les Paul models, the internal price at which Gibson sold the guitar to CMI, around a third of retail. It meant that for a guitar listing at $395, he would receive about $6.50.', 'Bruce Bolen, meanwhile, had a showstopper for his Gibson promo concerts. He took out on the road a prototype of the forthcoming reissue Les Paul Custom, probably by very late 1967. "People were just falling apart about it," he says with a grin. "They couldn\'t wait to get one."', 'At last, Gibson had woken up to the interest and decided to reintroduce two models: the relatively rare two-humbucker Les Paul Custom, and the Les Paul Goldtop in \'55–\'57 style with P-90 pickups and Tune-o-matic bridge. They were formally launched at the June \'68 NAMM trade show in Chicago, and Gibson\'s new pricelist showed the Custom at $545 and the Goldtop (they called it the Standard) at $395. Les Paul was at the show to promote the new guitars for Gibson by doing what he\'d always done best—playing the things. Bruce Bolen remembered providing the rhythm section for Les\' performances. "It was the first time in years that he\'d got on a stage. We had a lot of fun."', 'The press ad for the revived guitars, headlined "Daddy Of \'Em All," admitted Gibson had little choice in the matter. "The demand for them just won\'t quit," ran the blurb. "And the pressure to make more has never let up. OK, you win. We are pleased to announce that more of the original Les Paul Gibsons are available. Line forms at your Gibson dealer."', 'Around the time of that NAMM show, production of the new Customs and Goldtops began at Kalamazoo. Gibson\'s Jim Tite announced that production was expected to start in June. "The revival of these instruments answers a pressing need," he said. "It will soon be no longer necessary to search for used models that sell in auction for $700 to $1,000 in the United States."', 'Stan Rendell told me that the first run of the reissues in \'68, which took 90 days to get from wood shop to stock room, was for 500 guitars: 400 Goldtops and 100 Customs. "By the time we had that started, CMI wanted 100 a month of the Goldtop and 25 a month of the Custom, and before we were finished with that we were making a hundred Les Pauls a day," he said. "That\'s out of a total of 250, 300 instruments a day."', "Gibson clearly had a success in the making. The only mystery as far as many guitarists were concerned was why the company had waited so long—and why they reintroduced these particular models. Where was the reissue sunburst Les Paul with humbuckers? That took a good few years—and it's a story for another day.", '', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

For us in the business, NAMM is an industry focal point. But if you’re just a casual gear fan and musician, you might be wondering what this whole NAMM thing is all about anyway.', "In its simplest definition, NAMM—which stands for the National Association of Music Merchants—is a trade organization for the music gear industry. When people say NAMM, they're usually referring to the organization's annual January show in Anaheim, California, which brings together pros from every corner of the industry. In total, the show usually sees around 100,000 total attendees between exhibitors, artists, press, and the general public. This year, it's taking place January 16–19 at the Anaheim Convention Center.", 'So what exactly goes down at the NAMM Show?', 'Perhaps the most important part of NAMM is its place as a venue for gear manufacturers to announce new products. In fact, NAMM is so central a launchpad for new music gear products that most makers in the industry save their product news specifically for announcement at the show. As such, NAMM provides a platform for brands to speak to the press and their retail networks about new products and start building hype.', 'Sometimes, brands will even preview prototype gear at NAMM that\'s not yet available to general consumers. There\'s a glib saying that I\'ve heard batted around that defines NAMM as, "Not Available, Maybe May."', 'Nonetheless, the NAMM show has been the site of a staggering number of important gear introductions since its start in 1901.', 'Of course, a positive NAMM launch is not a surefire recipe for success. In many cases, production delays or design shortfalls can derail even the most powerful NAMM hype trains. Here on Reverb, we often see some heavily discussed NAMM releases selling used just a few months later for seriously reduced prices.', 'A number of makers have already announced some exciting new products ahead of the show opening next Thursday—and we expect a lot more: killer reissues of vintage gear, creative takes on well-known instruments, and new tech that just might change how music is made.', 'You can follow along with all of the latest and greatest releases from now through January 19 at our "NAMM 2020: New Product Releases and Highlights."', "This year, as every year, the Reverb crew will be on the floor at the NAMM show to shake hands, shoot video, and take in all the news and musical revelry.

Called a "transitional album" by critics, the opening track, "Stuff"—featuring Herbie Hancock on Fender Rhodes—marked Davis\' first tentative step, after decades as an acoustic artist, toward going electric.', 'Later that year, Davis released Filles de Kilimanjaro, which went further, and showed the influence of his then-fiancé, Betty Mabry. The couple married in fall \'68, but divorced a year later. Mabry—an important musician in her own right—released three epic funk albums as Betty Davis in the mid-\'70s. But while they were still together, Mabry turned Davis on to contemporary artists like Jimi Hendrix and Sly & the Family Stone (she also convinced him to update his wardrobe), and the album\'s final track, "Mademoiselle Mabry," lifted—or maybe it\'s better to say, borrowed—the main theme from "The Wind Cries Mary," from Hendrix\'s debut, Are You Experienced.', '"The music I was really listening to in 1968 was James Brown, the great guitar player Jimi Hendrix, and a new group… Sly & the Family Stone, led by Sly Stewart from San Francisco," Davis says in his autobiography. "The shit he was doing was badder than a motherfucker, had all kinds of funk shit up in it. But it was Jimi Hendrix that I first got into when Betty Mabry turned me on to him."', "Davis' landmark 1970 double LP Bitches Brew, released on the heels of In A Silent Way, was his second album to fully embrace electric instruments. Bitches Brew hit the jazz world like an atomic bomb. It was groove-centric, dissonant, and unconventional. It was also something of a hit, peaking at 35 on the Billboard 200, and it would eventually go platinum.", 'Davis then took another cue from Hendrix, to further electrify his trumpet.', "In 1971, he released Live-Evil—with Michael Henderson, poached from Stevie Wonder's band, on bass—and added a wah wah pedal to his signal chain for the first time. That effect transformed his sound and defined his tone for the rest of the decade.", '"I was using the wah wah on my trumpet all the time so I could get closer to that voice Jimi had when he used a wah wah on his guitar," Davis says, also in his autobiography. "I had always played trumpet like a guitar and the wah wah just made the sound closer."', 'Davis\' appreciation for the guitar stretched back at least as far as 1960\'s Sketches of Spain, which included Gil Evans\' new arrangement of a classical guitar masterpiece, "Concierto de Aranjuez." Davis struggled during the recording sessions to capture the right feel, but ultimately praised Evans\' flamenco-hued work: "He made that orchestra sound like one big guitar."', "The electrified wah was a different beast entirely, and it brought a whole new energy to Davis' playing from Live-Evil forward.", '"He was really into it," saxophonist David Liebman says about Davis\' embrace of the wah. Liebman was in Davis\' early-\'70s band and appears on the albums On The Corner, Dark Magus, Get Up With It, and a number of others released later. "As you can see in the videos, he\'s hunched over so his foot could be in a certain position. Sometimes they show pictures of his feet and he wore crazy shoes, but he was really into it. It wasn\'t a perfect machine for the trumpet. There were times when it was a little sketchy as far as its working, but if you listen to him without any judgment, it was actually pretty interesting."', "Davis' use of the wah is also somewhat ironic, as the original wahs took inspiration by the trumpet. Vox was the first company to have success selling them, and its model was named for trumpeter Clyde McCoy.", '"Apparently Vox management saw lots of potential in this new gizmo, and it was subsequently introduced as the Clyde McCoy wah-wah pedal," Art Thompson wrote in a May 1992 article for Guitar Player. "Clyde was actually a trumpet player who had asked Vox for a device that could simulate the sound of a muted trumpet for use with a keyboard. These early pedals were manufactured in Italy and have a picture of Clyde on the bottom. They were distributed in the US by the Thomas Organ Company. Later variants featured Clyde\'s signature only."', "In the late '60s, as guitarists embraced the devices, Vox dropped their association with Clyde McCoy, and created a number of variants as the company and its distributor worked to meet the growing demand.", 'Some Vox wahs of this era were made in Italy, others in the US, and you will find fans of each that praise particular models for their specific inductors, capacitors, and potentiometers. Geoffrey Teese, a vintage Vox expert, told Eric Kraft, a writer and guitarist that once played with Sly & The Family Stone, that there was a huge leap between the Clyde and the next model, the US-built V846, but that others that immediately followed were relatively similar to each other.', '"The Vox/USA V846 changed much more than just the inductor. Everything but the very basic resistors were changed, making the V846/King Vox Wah/CryBaby virtually an entirely new pedal," Teese said. However, because manufacturing processes were not standardized, these post-Clyde US- and Italian-made models could all have audible differences between them, even if they shared a name.', "Davis' wah—see a closeup in the video above at the 10:51 mark—was the King Wah. As you can hear, it imparted a quacking character to his trumpet's tone.", 'At their most basic level, all wahs are a kind of resonant filter, sharpening a peak of frequencies that moves through the bass-to-treble spectrum as a player swivels their foot. The abrasive guitars, electric pianos, snares, and cymbals of this new era of funk-inspired jazz were all competing for sonic space. Davis used the added attack of the King Wah to pierce through the chaotic jams and bring his voice back to the fore.', 'In 1972, Davis brought his wah into the studio to record On The Corner. On The Corner expands on the themes first introduced on Bitches Brew, except that the grooves are more repetitive, minimalist, and funky. It also features an expanded ensemble that includes electric sitar, tabla, and other assorted percussion.', '"On The Corner, which ran a cast of thousands, was like a Cecil B. DeMille production," Liebman says about the album\'s recording sessions. "Herbie, Chick Corea, John McLaughlin, Don Alias, Jack DeJohnette, Billy Hart, Collin Walcott—it\'s amazing I remember the names—everybody had their little scene in the room where Miles recorded. Everyone was plugged in direct except the drums, congas, and tablas. Bass, piano, and the guitars—all those guys were plugged into the board and I couldn\'t hear anything in the studio. I couldn\'t hear the key. Nobody gave me headphones. But like so many things in life, it\'s sometimes strange the ways things happen, and I just had to guess the key, and I got it right."', "But On The Corner was an anomaly, and aside from the sessions that made up the compilations Big Fun and Get Up With It, most of Davis' output from this period was live. Dark Magus, released in 1977—and only in Japan—was recorded live at Carnegie Hall in 1974. By that point, Davis had guitarists Pete Cosey and Reggie Lucas, as well as drummer Al Foster, and percussionist James Mtume in his band, who, along with Henderson, formed his core working group for the next few years. Keyboards, except when Davis played them, were out as well.", '"That was definitely one of the loudest band that I ever heard," Liebman says about Davis\' Dark Magus-era band. "I\'ve played in many rock bands, but this was a very loud band. I believe I was also using effects at that point as well. I had an orange box, which was a chorus, and an Echoplex."', 'As the \'70s wore on, Davis retreated into a dark period, usually referred to as his "retirement," of drugs and sex—compounded by numerous health issues—and didn\'t record new material until his comeback in the early \'80s. But while he was away, his post-Bitches Brew, wah-inflected work—generally not well-received at the time of release—began to take on a life of its own. Younger players absorbed his music from that period and many cite it as a major influence. That list includes everyone from the Beastie Boys to Material (whose core of Bill Laswell, Michael Beinhorn, and Fred Maher went on to become major producers in their own right) to experimentalists like Henry Kaiser, and many others.', "Davis returned in the '80s with a new, young band—Foster was the only holdover from the '70s—and began a new chapter of his ever-evolving sonic adventure. He embraced slap bass, nurtured the careers of a number of exceptional guitarists, and even reintroduced keyboards into his lineup.", 'However, times were changing, and by then he stopped using the wah.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

The rack system was it, baby, and who would expect to see anything but a big-ass rack rig in the backlines of concert stages the world over?", "After all, those 19-inch reverbs and delays and harmonizers weren't going to wire up themselves. And where would your three-channel tube preamp go, and the dual-100-watt power amp that you slaved it all into? Guitar pedals and old-school amps—leave that stuff for the garage bands and blues clubs. Even your aspiring weekend rock warrior at the 200-capacity local venue was racking it up circa 1989. Analog pedals and integrated traditional amp heads and combos? Chances are, soon nobody would even make them anymore.", "Which, of course, never happened. But for a while, that's sure where the guitar world appeared to be headed. So what happened to those rack-centric rigs, what replaced them, and have they found a fresh role in today's music? To get there, let's talk to some of the key techs from the heyday of that sector to find out how the whole phenomenon got started in the first place, why it suited guitarists' needs so well at the time, and whether it really went away... or just evolved into something different.", "Robert (Bob) Bradshaw's name and his Custom Audio Electronics (CAE) company are synonymous with custom pedal controllers, switching networks, and rack-based guitar rigs. He veritably initiated the trend, was at its epicenter throughout the boom, and continues to make custom touring rigs to this day. Having started in the business before the stage rack was even a thing for guitarists, he would not only create such rigs for the biggest artists in the business, but would develop and drive much of the technology that helped to make those rack systems work.", 'When Bradshaw first arrived in Los Angeles in 1978 to work in the industry, however, guitarists were still largely struggling to make disparate collections of pedals and the occasional big studio outboard unit play nice together with traditional guitar amps, and he was navigating uncharted territory to get there.', '"When I started," Bradshaw tells us, "it was really just pedals still. So, I was taking pedalboards and instead of them being on the floor, taking them out and rack-mounting pedals, or putting them in different enclosures."', '"In fact, the first racks that I ever worked with were stereo component racks, that had a glass front. This was for Buzzy Feiten, who was my first major client. There was a Technics home stereo rack, and I had to put rack rails in it in order to mount the stuff. There weren\'t drawers yet, per se, there were just pedals mounted at a slant on top, and the rack stuff mounted down below it."', 'From this rudimentary start, Bradshaw pioneered methods of mounting discrete effects units and building custom remote foot controllers and switching systems to assimilate them into an artist\'s stage or studio rig. Once the effects no longer needed to be on the floor under the guitarist\'s feet, the rig could be perceived, and conceived, in an entirely new light. Essentially, long before the multi-FX units of the \'90s came into being, Bradshaw was custom-building bespoke "multiple-effects systems" out of whatever any given artist might want to incorporate into a rig, and the service caught on big time.', "Over in the UK, prominent techs like Pete Cornish were working toward similar goals. His own work more often consisted of repackaging artists' preferred effects pedals into integral units that enabled them to work seamlessly together, with a buffered output to help them travel the long cable runs required of stadium-sized stages. But as the rack craze got going, this also became more and more a part of his efforts.", 'With all such ventures, Cornish says, "My first consideration is not to lose the tone and dynamics of the guitar. My main contention is with the myth of \'true bypass.\' The true-bypass function, which is promoted by some, can create dreadful problems with a system that uses many pedals. Take, for instance, a 15\' guitar cable linked to six pedals, each linked by a 2\' cable, and then on to the amp by say a 3-\' cable. If all pedals have \'true bypass,\' and are off, then the total cable length hanging on the guitar output will be 55\'. This will cause a huge loss of tone and signal level."', "While alleviating these problems in the early '80s, Cornish built remote rack effects systems and boards for Andy Summers of The Police, James Honeyman-Scott of The Pretenders, John Deacon of Queen, Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits, and near-countless others, although his meat 'n' potatoes business still revolved around custom pedalboards that remained under guitarists' feet front-of-stage.", 'Back in the States, Bob Bradshaw was dealing with similar issues on a daily basis. The effort required more than just bundling the individual pieces together and making foot controllers to switch them. "There was a lot of learning how to deal with impedances and stuff," Bradshaw says. "[At first] I was working with pedals mostly, and Echoplexes and stuff like that. And then rackmounted stuff came into it.', '"Studio guys would come to me and say, \'I want to use this Eventide Harmonizer…\' It was meant for studio use, and the early H910 Harmonizers or the H949s and stuff were 100% wet, there wasn\'t any control for mixing direct sound with those things. They were made to be used in a mix bus, so there was no dry signal passing through them. And keep in mind, in the beginning all of the effects chains were right into the front end of the amp, and there was no such thing as preamps or effects loops when I started."', "To get these complex networks of disparate effects working together, and hitting the amp without significant loss of signal or veracity of tone, Bradshaw developed interfaces that consisted of multi-channel mixers to blend several effects in series. While working with Michael Landau around 1980, though, Bradshaw noticed that however well-put-together the rack system, the resultant guitar tone lost a little veracity going into the front-end of a traditional guitar amp, and the wet effects such as reverb, delay, and modulation weren't translating the full meat of the guitar tone, either.", "What they wanted was a better approximation of the sound of these effects as used in the studio, where a guitar amp would be mic'd up and that signal would be run through the rack effects via the mixing desk.", "The solution that he and Landau developed—and which he'd apply to the rigs of Steve Lukather, Eddie Van Halen, and other major artists soon after—was to use the entire amp head essentially as a preamp, padded down with a load after the speaker output (initially just a fixed resistor, but later a speaker in an enclosed box to present a reactive load for improved dynamics), and to tap a line-level signal from that, which would run into the effects rack. From there, the signal would be amplified by MOSFET power amplifiers.", '"Landau and I did this first," says Bradshaw, "and voila! Here we\'ve got the thickness of the amp sound, because we\'re hearing the whole sound of the amplifier." While the tone was there, however, the weight and load required to achieve the entire rig was formidable.', '"I toured with Steve Lukather from \'85 until \'92," he recalls, "so we\'re taking around a Soldano SLO 100 for a lead sound, a modified Marshall for a crunch sound, and a long-box Mesa-Boogie for a clean sound. So this is a big-ass case that you\'re touring around with! And built into this case it\'s got these load boxes too, that are rumbling away next to the amplifiers. I go, \'Man, there\'s got to be a way to cut this down. These amps are being used as preamps. What if we take the preamp stages of these things and put it into a two-rack-space box?\'"', "Around 1987 or early '88 Bradshaw tasked a young amp maker named Michael Soldano with building a separate three-channel tube preamp, with one channel based on his own SLO 100 lead sound, one on a modified-Marshall crunch sound, and one on a Fender Twin-style clean sound. Soldano's X88R was born (named after the year it hit the market). Lukather loved it and took it out on tour, and soon many major artists were ditching their traditional amps for independent preamps.", "As the system became even more rack-centric in the late '80s, Bradshaw and other techs and the artists they served also turned to separate rackmounted tube power amps for their back-end. Early on, these frequently came in the form of powerful Mesa-made units originally intended for the company's bass amps, but makers like VHT, Egnater, and others soon developed better guitar-voiced power amps.", 'As so often happens, once the rack warriors got a system that took them to the next level, they soon began to see ways in which that could be improved upon too. Noting several ways in which the groundbreaking Soldano preamp could be upgraded, Bradshaw started talking to New York City guitar tech John Suhr, who had recently moved into amp modification and design.', '"I was making my living working at Rudy\'s [Music Stop] in Soho as well as playing the clubs in New Jersey and in an original band in New York City," Suhr tells us. "I met Bob when I ordered my rig. I was unsatisfied with the amp suggestions, and threw myself into designing an amp that better appealed to my taste and ears. I told Bob about a Marshall I loved that I modified, and he asked me to do one for him so he could hear it. I modded one of his Marshalls, sent it back, and he loved it."', 'Bradshaw takes up the story: "I said, \'John, what would you think about doing another three-channel preamp? \'Cos I think the Soldano preamp needs help.\' John and I developed the 3+ Tube Preamp and added our own take and gave it what I think is more life."', 'The preamp became a huge hit with CAE customers, including Steve Lukather, so Bradshaw and Suhr started a partnership: Custom Audio Amplifiers (CAA). "I was going to stay in New York," adds Suhr, "but it became too big for Bob to handle alone so I moved to North Hollywood, where I did amp mods, helped Bob build rigs, designed PCBs for some of his products, and built preamps."', "Once the rack systems got rolling, they were just about everywhere with professional players, in California—and on world tours—in particular. Suhr remembers the whirlwind that was the rack-rig industry of the '90s:", '"We went through a lot of R&D and listening tests... It wasn\'t about a method or a piece of gear, it was really about what the customer wanted. We didn\'t build \'racks,\' we customized solutions for guitar players. They just happened to turn into racks most of the time. As far as artists, it was really everyone in the scene, including some of the friends I\'ve connected with over the years, like Steve Stevens, Reb Beach, Eddie Martinez, and Frampton, and people like Lukather, Landau, EVH, and way too many to remember."', '"And I was involved with situations like, for instance, the racks of Tommy Skeoch of Tesla. [Doing Bradshaw\'s voice]: \'Hey, John, Tommy needs three Marshalls modified for three different sounds, but will always use two of the Marshalls for power amps, so we need great effects loops to interface and three different high-gain preamp sections…\'"', '', "Although his name is better known today as the brand behind one of the rock world's favorite lines of modified-Marshall-style tube amps, Dave Friedman also got his start in the industry via the rack-rig boom.", 'Friedman was just a youngster in the business when he moved to Los Angeles from Detroit in 1987, nearly 10 years after Bradshaw\'s arrival there. He first took up work at Andy Brauer\'s Studio Rentals business, doing gear cartage for major artists like Lukather, Dean Parks, and Michael Landau, which got him into the same circles in which the other rack warriors were moving. When Studio Rentals\' custom-rack guy left the company, Friedman hit up the boss with a "Hey, I think I can do that for you!" And the rest, as we say, is history.', '"I was putting them together, assembling them, and eventually that snowballed over time," Friedman tells us. "I\'ve done rack systems for everyone known to mankind, Eddie Van Halen and the like. But it all started with Bob Bradshaw assembling rigs and stuff, and there were all sorts of new rackmounted effects devices that started to pop up in the \'80s. The SPX-90 [a Yamaha reverb unit] came along and Eventides and Lexicons, and people wanted to incorporate those in their rigs."', 'Although the rack system appears big and cumbersome to many guitarists today, Friedman declares, "In reality, a rack is kind of simple. And if you think about it, if you have a rack preamp and a power amp and effects in one rack, the only connection is your pedalboard connection and your speaker cables, so it\'s actually quite simple. There\'s actually less setup than separate heads and pedalboards and such."', '"They were intuitive, easy, and would allow you to be professional," adds Suhr. "I plugged my guitar into the front, two speaker cables to the cabinets, one multi-pin to the controller, and I was ready to play. Plus, you could easily craft it to have sounds that nobody else had."', 'Having entered the rack game near its peak, however, Friedman wasn\'t in the business long before the trend began to tail off. Asked about that time in the late \'80s and early \'90s when the industry was predicting the death of the traditional rig consisting of a guitar amp and a handful of pedals, he quips, "Yeah, well, that didn\'t pan out! [Laughs.]"', 'Friedman elaborates: "The music changed in the early \'90s and then you start to see pedals creep back into the scenario more like it was in the \'70s. Lots of players wanted to incorporate pedals into their rigs again, so often we saw the racks starting to go away, and pedalboards starting to take back over."', "In addition to the boutique pedal boom of the '90s, the boutique amp craze also tantalized many guitarists with a reminder of how invigorating it could be to plug straight into a raging, hand-wired tube amp and have at it. And right alongside these trends, musical styles were also changing, returning a more raw, ragged, and tech-averse attitude to the big concert stage.", "Grunge hit the airwaves and the tour circuits alike, and all at once thousands of guitarists were chasing the sounds Kurt Cobain was making with a few simple '70s-era pedals into the front of whatever standard combo or stack was handy (although he did also use a Mesa-Boogie preamp into a Crown power amp when the gig demanded), or the tone of Pearl Jam's Mike McCready into an old Fender Bassman and the like. Certainly, commercial artists who already had their big rack rigs still took them on tour, but that was no longer the driving trend in the guitar world.", "For Bradshaw's part, he saw bust times for rack dominance ushered in partly by the units that were intended to be the epitome of rackmounted effects: the big multi-FX systems.", '"A lot of manufacturers started coming out with multi-effects," Bradshaw recalls, "and... you get jazzed about it at first, and then you go, \'No, this thing\'s a pain in the ass to sit there and press a button and watch the number scroll!\' It takes time, and they might switch slowly for channel-switching or MIDI control or something. And they have 12 effects! ART had a rackmount thing that you could use 12 simultaneous effects in \'em, and most of \'em sounded like shit!"', 'A big part of what did in the monster racks of these rigs\' heyday, though, according to Bradshaw, came from the fact that many of the players who first lauded their use were getting fed up with hauling the things around. As Bradshaw puts it: "The guys at the forefront of racks at the time, they\'re getting older and they didn\'t want to lug a bunch of gear around. They\'re not 20 years old any more, they\'re 30 and 35 and 40 or whatever. Number one, they don\'t want to lug stuff; number two, freight went through the roof. It was insane how the freight costs got crazy as hell."', 'Pete Cornish concurs with the latter, and even sites a notable first-hand example: "Discussions with Lou Reed, when he was still touring, revealed that the transport costs to ship his three-part rack had risen to such an amount that it was no longer viable, and we created a smaller pedal-based system that he then used for the remainder of his life."', 'But did the rack system ever really go away? As Friedman, Cornish, Bradshaw, and Suhr all agree, it never so much disappeared entirely as evolved into something else—as touring rigs have done more or less constantly since the inception of the electric guitar and amplifier. Today, racks are still at the center of many large touring rigs, even if they contain different devices than might have populated them in 1989.', '"To the question of \'Have racks really gone away?\'" says Friedman, "it depends on what you\'re talking about [laughs]. They\'ve morphed in and out over the years with the sound and style of music; they\'ve come back in a different way now, and now I even wonder if we\'re going to see guitar rack preamps have a resurgence. I\'m kind of interested in that! But the only racks you see today are for larger touring acts. Right now I\'m doing a whole backline for Guns N\' Roses, and they have mostly pedals installed in racks that they use with their amplifiers."', '"The last rack that left our workshops was in 2007," says Cornish, "and was shipped to Japan for Kenichi Tahara of the band Mr. Children. Since then, we have concentrated on the manufacture of pedals and our own custom pedalboards, but Paul McCartney and Bryan Adams are still using the rack systems we built for them, and I have had them in for servicing recently."', 'Bradshaw tells us he still builds plenty of rack-based rigs, but the effects going into them are different, and often the formats today lean toward what he calls "hybrid" rigs. "It\'s mostly pedals," he elaborates. "There\'s not much rackmount gear available any more, not like there was. And of course, the trend nowadays is Fractals and Line 6 and Kempers. It\'s kind of come back around to a bunch shit in one box! [Laughs] But the quality of those has gotten better, the technology has improved."', '"But I do a lot of rigs that incorporate both pedals and Fractals. I do that with Edge, it\'s a pretty massive system, and I did another pretty large hybrid system, as I call it, with Steph Carpenter of Deftones. He\'s got drawers of pedals, he\'s got a Fractal in there, and he went back to his tube Marshall preamp."', '"To me, this is just another cycle," adds Suhr, "a facelift, and not much has really changed. It\'s the same effects in smaller packages, which can make them more confusing if you are not careful as a designer. I miss the big rig, except for the weight. It was more intuitive, easy to program, quicker to get a sound, and I rarely had to jump through a bunch of menus to do anything."', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Let me explain.', "Cleary, it wasn't Fred Gretsch Sr. or his father, Friedrich, who founded the Gretsch company in New York City in the late 19th century. And it wasn't Fred Sr.'s son, the pioneering Fred Gretsch Jr., who'd seen the brand through its glory years in the '50s and '60s with all those lovely 6120s and Falcons and Jets and Gents and the rest. Fred Jr. had died in 1980 at the age of 75.", 'Our "new" Fred Gretsch was a nephew of Fred Gretsch Jr. and the son of Bill Gretsch, who ran the company from 1942 until his premature death six years later. New Fred worked at Gretsch himself for six years from 1965, but following the sale of Gretsch to Baldwin in 1967, he began to look elsewhere, and in 1971 began his own business, importing and wholesaling instruments. In 1980, he bought the Synsonics brand from Mattel, using it for acoustic and electronic percussion and electric guitars.', "Fred meanwhile kept an eye on the deteriorating state of Gretsch under Baldwin ownership. Neither Gretsch nor Baldwin benefitted much from their deal, and eventually Baldwin's bosses decided they'd had enough and would stop production of Gretsch guitars. Not much was manufactured beyond the start of 1981. In early 1982, Charlie Roy bought the business from Baldwin and set up offices in Gallatin, Tennessee, just outside Nashville.", 'Charlie continued to sell existing stock of Gretsch guitars probably as late as 1983. Baldwin then regained control of Gretsch. Jerry Perito at Gretsch came up with an idea to make Country Gents renamed as Southern Belle models (and a few years earlier, the Gent was briefly renamed the Country Squire). Perito then led a last-ditch plan to revive Gretsch guitar production at a Baldwin piano-action factory in Ciudad Juarez, just across the border in Mexico, but the idea was soon dropped.', "Baldwin United, as it was now known, went bankrupt in late 1983, and in summer '84 the company's CEO, Dick Harrison, and a partner bought the musical elements of the business. Their new Baldwin Piano & Organ Co. sold on the Kustom brand and then turned their attention to Gretsch.", "It's worth remembering that in the '80s, there was relatively little interest in Gretsch guitars much beyond those on a quest to complete their sets of Beatle-related collectables. Dealers sold the occasional old Falcon or 6120 for over $1,000, but other Gretsches went for much less. There was Poison Ivy in The Cramps with her '50s 6120 and Brian Setzer of Stray Cats heading up a rockabilly revival with another vintage 6120, but there wasn't too much more visible action for the brand.", "Baldwin brought in Duke Kramer, a longstanding Gretsch executive, to handle the sale of Gretsch. At first he tried Fender, but management there was busy preparing to buy Fender from CBS. So he turned to Fred Gretsch, who bought the business in January 1985. Fred's plan was to continue making Gretsch drums for a year and then to revive the guitar business.", 'Duke and Fred drew up specifications for a set of Gretsch guitars—and then had to find a factory to make them. Duke met with several American firms, including Heritage, Guild, and Gibson. Those ideas proved unworkable, so the next option was to go offshore. Duke went to Japan and chose Terada, an experienced firm in Nagoya that was used to making quality hollowbody guitars.', 'In the meantime, though, Gretsch produced an unusual stopgap with a series of Korean-made electrics named for the Traveling Wilburys, the fictional family supergroup of George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Roy Orbison. The guitars were apparently based, rather loosely, on some old Danelectro instruments. The few short-lived models were without Gretsch markings and all boldly finished in various "original graphics" with an appropriate travel theme.', "Fred Gretsch Enterprises Ltd announced its first line of proper new Gretsch guitars in the second half of 1989. The company was unable to use the names of Chet Atkins and the associated models, because of Chet's defection to Gibson in 1980, so some model names had to be modified.", "Gretsch listed five hollowbodies in that first lineup—Tennessee Rose (the revised name for a Chet Tennessean), Nashville (a plain 6120 using its post-'66 model name), Nashville Western (a 6120 with G-brand), Country Classic I (the revised name for a Chet Country Gent single-cut), and Country Classic II (a Gent double-cut)—along with four solids (Duo Jet, Silver Jet, Jet Firebird, and Round Up). A later '89 catalogue added a few White Falcons to the list.", 'This was a good start for the revived Gretsch brand, and more reissues would appear along in the coming years as the firm got into its stride, including Anniversary models, Country Clubs, and a White Penguin, as well as signature models for Bo Diddley, Elliot Easton, Duane Eddy, Keith Scott, Brian Setzer, Stephen Stills, and Malcolm Young.', 'New twists appeared, too, such as Falcons finished in black or with silver-colored metalwork, scaled-down versions of various models, several colored sparkle-finish Jets, a 12-string or two, a double-neck Jet, and some new Spectra-Sonic models (six- string, baritone, and bass) designed with TV Jones, who devised pickups and consulted for Gretsch.', 'Gretsch first began to consider more accurate re-creations of old designs in 1992, when it attempted a vintage-style 6120, calling it the Nashville 6120-1960. It was a commendable effort, with thumbnail markers, zero fret, three knobs and two selectors, and a body two-and-a-half inches deep, but details like the Bigsby and the bridge seemed adrift. Further bids for vintage veracity came with oldie-style takes on the Country Classic (Gent), Country Club, Duo Jet, Falcon, Nashville (6120), Silver Jet, and Tennessee Rose (Tennessean).', 'It was Gretsch\'s alliance with Fender, starting officially on the first day of 2003, that seemed at last to make the most of what Gretsch had to offer. Fred was keen to explain that this was not a takeover. "We still own and control the brand," he told me at the time, "and Fender does the marketing, manufacturing, and distribution."', "Fender made a complete overhaul of the line, overseen by Mike Lewis, who had worked at Fender since the early '90s and now became Gretsch's marketing manager. Mike changed virtually every specification of every model, and in 2007 he supervised the return of the Chet Atkins name to Gretsch, which allowed the reintroduction of the original model names (except the Tennessean, because Gibson still owned the trademark on that one).", "Since its rebirth 30 years ago, the Gretsch line has flourished, especially since the alliance with Fender (look for a serial number starting with two or three letters to indicate a Gretsch from the Fender era). Today, there are dozens of model variations to choose from, although the core models survive, not only in broad feature styles but also in ever-more-accurate Vintage Select Edition versions. There are some interesting newer model families, such as the Center Blocks, while the Custom Shop, established at Fender's US factory in 2004, caters for individual fancies—a pink paisley Duo Jet, anyone?", 'Vintage fans will argue that an old Gretsch can still offer a sonic and ergonomic charm all its own, but for many players, the brand and its new guitars have never seemed in better shape.', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music. He is a co-founder of Backbeat UK and Jawbone Press. His books include The Gretsch Electric Guitar Book, History Of The American Guitar, and Guitars: The Illustrated Encyclopedia.

Today, we're dipping into a realm you could call one of our specialities: vintage oddities.", "Quick: how do you think a staple like the Jazz Bass became a legendary instrument? Trial and error. After Fender and Gibson became mainstays in the '50s, the following decades saw dozens of competitors continually innovating, in search of that next great bass.", 'While the end result was a dud more often than not, some of those "errors" ended up becoming cult favorites that still catch the eyes of those in the know. Let\'s take a look at five examples.', 'The four words "Gibson Les Paul Signature" probably bring to mind a high-end custom model made to the specifications of someone like Duane Allman or Billy Gibbons. The real answer is even more interesting: the company\'s cult favorite semi-hollowbody bass.', "Made from 1973 through 1978, the original Les Paul Signature production numbered around 1,500 guitars and even fewer basses. One of the end results of the company's experimentation with low-impedance pickups (these can also be found in the Recording Bass, later renamed the Triumph), the Signature was designed by Les Paul himself, after Gibson and its most famous endorsee rekindled their partnership, having split through the lion's share of the '60s.", 'If some woody Gibson tone grabs your attention, these guys regularly sell on Reverb for around $3,000. The Les Paul Signature Bass was also remade as the Epiphone Jack Casady Signature, which found favor with players like Pino Palladino and Mani of The Stone Roses.', 'You might be able to see through these modernist masterpieces, but the sustain rendered from a Dan Armstrong Lucite Bass is as thick as a wall.', 'While it\'s not the first mass-produced plastic stringed instrument (that distinction goes to the National "Map" guitars), the Lucite line is still one of the best-known examples of an acrylic guitar or bass. The see-through guitars and basses were made after Ampeg approached Dan Armstrong, a respected guitar tech in NYC, in 1967. Armstrong picked the specific type of acrylic, named Lucite, because he believed it would sustain well. He was right. (The line\'s official model names, like the ARMB-1, have largely been neglected by fans and players in favor of the simple "Lucite" or "See-Through.")', 'Only produced for a couple of years (until later reissues), the Lucite Bass found its way into the hands of legends like Geezer Butler and Phil Lynott and modern players like Jesse Keeler of Death From Above 1979. Both originals and reissues crop up regularly on the site and sell for typically between $1,500 and $3,000. Keep a weather eye for the ultra-rare black smoke version.', 'The name might not leap out at you, but S.D. Curlee is a rightfully lauded name in the bass community for a style unlike any other. In addition to angular design and DiMarzio pickups, these guys are remarkable for their history as the first American company to license their designs to Japanese manufacturers.', 'Founded in 1976 by three partners outside of Chicago, S.D. Curlee focused on three points in their production: a natural look, solid playability, and affordable prices. Before closing up shop in 1982, the company developed a loyal following for basses (and occasional guitar) that came out of their shop. In that five-year run, Curlee made the maverick move to partner with Japanese manufacturers and produce licensed copies as opposed to unlicensed (which, as we know, was the case with juggernauts like Gibson).', 'Recently, the S.D. Curlee name was revived by the Birdsong company, which created the article where much of this information came from. For a deeper dive into this little-known yet fascinating realm of gear history, follow the link here.', 'This 360 counterpart is a textbook example of an instrument produced in low numbers because of low demand that went on to fetch high demand for its low numbers. A hulking semi-hollow body, the Rickenbacker 4005 is a titan both in size and price tag: These basses regularly sell for around $10,000, but we were lucky enough to get our hands on one for a demo.', 'Considering the hefty weight of a 4005 in spite of its design, this holy grail bass summons tone as cavernous as a hidden temple full of mystical relics. That sacred tone is complemented by sumptuous touches like a multi-part neck, checkerboard binding, and a small "filter" knob for more kick that never caught on. It has been seen in the hands Noel Gallagher, Geddy Lee, and even modern players like Chris Baio of Vampire Weekend.', 'In spite of a production run from 1965 to 1984, there were surprisingly few ever made. According to Reverb sales figures, most 4005s seem to come in Fireglo, with a slimmer offering in Mapleglo. There are a few even rarer finishes, including the delightfully absurd "Lightshow" model.', "If you're lucky enough to come across one, you have a king's ransom on your hands.", 'The Gretsch 6070 is a single-pickup, hollowbody bass created in the image of the Country Gentleman guitar—and was therefore called the Country Gentleman Bass. Like some models of its six-string counterpart, the Country Gentleman Bass features a solid top with decorative, painted-on f-holes, in order to head off feedback issues.', "Made from 1962 to 1972, the 6070 is a big bass, with a thick neck that would feel positively gargantuan in many player's hands. But like the Country Gent guitar, there are some features made for comfort, like the padded back and the dual thumb and finger rests, and others built for tonal variety: the mechanical mute system near the bridge and a tone switch for its single Filter'Tron humbucker.", "While the sheer mass of the body, neck, and headstock might give the impression that you're playing an upright, the bottom strap peg goes one step further. You can extend the endpin into a stand, letting you play the bass in upright position. You can find similar models from Gretsch with different pickup, body, and finish variations: the 6071, 6072, and 6073.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

It is extremely customizable, and designers can either use its eight built-in programs or write their own and store them on what's called an external electrically-erasable programmable ROM, or EEPROM.", 'But wait: before your eyes glaze over, know that the FV-1 changed everything.', 'Spin Semiconductor released the chip in 2006, and companies took to it immediately. Enabling sounds like warped polyphonic harmonies and spatial delays that were never before possible, Electro-Harmonix used it on their first multi-effects pedal, the Holy Stain, and EarthQuaker Devices uses it on the Dispatch Master and Rainbow Machine.', 'Engineers were—and are—drawn to the chip for its ability to program audio expansion and compression routines (the process by which data is expanded or compressed). Plus, they can incorporate integrated digital LFOs and ramp generators to program things like multi-voiced pitch-shifting, reverb, and outrageous delay.', 'The FV-1 was the last major innovation of legendary audio engineer Keith Barr, who died in 2010.', 'Barr co-founded MXR with his friend from high school, Terry Sherwood, in 1972 and was behind the design of devices like the Phase 90, Dyna Comp, and Blue Box. According to the Dunlop website, these hall-of-fame effects were initially assembled in a basement and sold out of a car at local shows when bands came to town.', 'Barr launched his second company, Alesis, in 1984 with an initial roster of inexpensive digital reverbs. In 1991, the Alesis Digital Audio Tape machine (ADAT)—the first affordable digital multitrack recorder—made its debut. The ADAT deserves an article in and of itself.', 'It was at Alesis where Barr met Frank Thomson, who began working for the brand in 1991 as part of an R&D group doing application-specific integrated circuit design (ASIC). "My desk was right outside of Keith\'s office," Thomson says. Such proximity and his penchant for developing great DSP chips (like those found in the ADAT and effects processors like QuadraVerb 2) would soon lead to the development of the FV-1.', 'Thomson is currently CEO of the Experimental Noize pedal and pro audio company. He also oversees production, planning, shipping, and tech support for Spin Semiconductor on behalf of Barr’s widow.', '"Keith was actually very cool. He would stop to look at what I was working on and ask questions about design choices I made. My first design was the S4DSP ASIC used in the QuadraSynth keyboards. That worked out well, so he would often talk to me about other ideas he had for other digital products."', 'Thomson continues: "After Alesis was acquired [by Jack O\'Donnell in 2001], we both worked in different areas, but remained in contact. I was able to get a NAMM pass each year, so I kept attending and over time realized there was a demand for a DSP targeted at reverb, delay, and things like that. I talked with Keith about it, and he started Spin Semiconductor to fund and create the chip. I was contracted to work on the design with him, which was eventually created and brought to market.”', "Now that we know the history of the chip, let's see what engineers can do with it.", 'In this roundup, we showcase an array of idiosyncratic pedals that show off the FV-1’s capabilities, which are seemingly endless. The chip enables functions that range from the ridiculous to the sublime, and according to some, may represent the last major advancement to impact the boutique pedal industry.', 'The SSD Atom Smasher is a glitch delay pedal that generates a potpourri of oddball noises like stutter and phrase capture, reverse ramp delay with ring modulation, various delays combined with octave glitches and pitch-shifting, and reverse reverb.', 'Alex Lynham, the company founder, wrote a Medium post about the intricacies of programing the FV-1. "The FV-1 uses a dialect of assembly [or basic assembly language] called SpinASM," he wrote. "You can write it in a text editor and compile it using a program that SpinSemi provide. However, if you’re looking to create more standard effects (chorus, phaser, reverb) for example, you might find that Digital Larry’s brilliant SpinCAD has what you need built in."', 'He continues: "In fact, I’d hazard a guess and say there’s probably a fair few commercial boutique pedals whose code was generated by SpinCAD rather than handwritten. For mucking around with reverb blocks and pre- and post-processing, I’ve found it to be lots of fun, and the glitch and pitch reverbs in the Atom Smasher were made using it."', 'The Chase Bliss Audio> Mood is a two-channel granular micro looper and delay, built in conjunction with Old Blood Noise Endeavors and DroloFx. "One thing I really love is that since so many DSP engineers use the FV-1 as a platform, it makes it a really friendly device for collaboration and creativity," says Chase Bliss founder and engineer Joel Korte.', 'Mood is split down the middle: The left side controls the OBNE choppy delays and reverbs, while the right side handles the Drolo granular loopers and tape-like functions. Each side was built around an FV-1, which was programmed by the respective designer. "Both were responsible for writing DSP code for one FV-1," Korte says. "I then controlled the routing and control of the chips."', 'As opposed to some of the other pedals in this roundup, which emphasize the weird, the Walrus Audio Arp-87 is a utilitarian workhorse.', "It’s built around an FV-1 core, and Walrus took advantage of the platform’s versatility to program a diverse set of algorithms that offer digital, analog, lo-fi, and slap back options. (The FV-1 is also at the heart of the company's Fathom Reverb as well).", 'The Arp-87 was built without a time knob, and uses tap tempo—in conjunction with a ratio control—to determine delay speed. The pedal’s selling-point is a set of functional, traditional delays, although it can do some subtle warbles, warps, and darker tones, too.', 'Although the Absolüte Würst started as an April Fool’s joke, it is a serious pedal with a cult following among connoisseurs of the bizarre. Inspired by the DOD Gonkulator Ring Modulator, the Würst makes broken robot noises and unpredictable blurps and grunts.', 'Designer and company founder Robert Keeley took advantage of the FV-1’s highly programmable parameters and built functions like a random harmony generator, pitch-up ring modulation with tracking, and even something called the "drunken bass player."', 'The pedal generated a lot of buzz when it was first released and Nick Reinhart, of the rock band Tera Melos and the blog/YouTube channel, Pedals and Effects, listed it as one of his top pedals of 2015.', 'Unfortunately, it seems that Keeley since got cold feet and pulled the pedal. If you follow the link to the Absolüte Würst on the Keeley Electronics website, it takes you to this depressing 404 message. Used models do appear on Reverb from time to time.', 'The Black Hole Symmetry is the first offering from Collision Devices a (seemingly) standard-issue FV-1 derived unit, sans the glitches and stutters. But don’t be fooled: Black Hole Symmetry takes reverb and delay, mixes it with onboard fuzz, and creates something anomalous and new.', 'The reverb—in addition to producing breathy, ethereal soundscapes—combines with a pitch-shifting function to allow for edgy, angular sounds. The delay mode also modulates, which enables warbles and warps.', 'Plus, the circuit integrates with an internal fuzz, and when run in conjunction with the other sections, allows for everything from subtle synth-like sounds to sonic obliteration.', 'The Red Panda Tensor is a great example of the FV-1’s programmability and the wild diversity of available options. Part sampler, part pitch-shifting harmonizer, the Tensor can summon standard loops and whammy-type effects, reverse lines tracked in real time, tape stops and slow downs, time-stretching, and randomized stutters/glitches.', 'It’s set up so when you stretch or compress time, your pitch doesn’t change, and the loops can be run forwards, in reverse, alternating between the two, sped up, or slowed down in triple time. It does a lot more than that as well, but—and this holds true for the other unusual noise makers featured here—you really need to get one under your feet and explore it yourself.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

These interviews will be appearing on Reverb in the coming months.", "For previous installments, take a look at Tony's interviews with Phil Lynott, Robert Fripp, and Duane Eddy, as well as a talk with the man who prototyped the Strat.", 'I interviewed Pete Cornish in 1982 to find out about the man we might well consider the godfather of the pedalboard. He began making his now-famous boards in the early ‘70s, working with many well known British guitarists of the period. Pete would go on to make boards for Jimmy Page, Brian May, Andy Summers, James Honeyman-Scott, and many others. He built plenty of other custom gear, too—whatever bands couldn’t buy anywhere else—and he’s still going strong today.', 'Back in ’82, I braved a scruffy alley in Soho, central London, and sat down for a cup of tea and a chat. We decided to mark the 10th anniversary of Pete’s first pedalboard by taking a trawl through his record books, where he noted each one he’d made. But first: a little background.', 'Pete, I believe all this began when you started in the repair department at the Sound City shop in London in the early ‘70s. Is that right?', 'Well, before that, after leaving school in 1960, I did a three-year electronics course with the Air Ministry in Chislehurst [southeast London], where I mainly worked on radios. After that, I worked for a few electronics firms around Bromley, and then I got a job working for the Sound City factories, but I didn’t particularly like the environment.', 'Somebody who had worked at the Sound City shop told me there was a vacancy, and so the opportunity came up to work in the service department there. I got the job, and I was there from 1970 or ’71 until it closed in ’75 or so.', 'Note: Sound City was a central-London music shop, and from the mid ‘60s also a brand used by Dallas-Arbiter for amplifiers. The Sound City shop was originally at 24 Rupert Street, moving to 124 Shaftesbury Avenue in 1964, with the related Drum City at 114.', 'Were you doing general repairs there?', 'Well, that was when I started to make stuff. It was initially repairs and servicing, and then it became apparent that there was a need for good guitar leads [In Britspeak, a “lead” is a cable]. That was the first thing. I spent a long time investigating noiseless cable and discovered the Belden stuff, which now seems to be everywhere. Took me over a year to find that.', 'How did the need for a better type of cable become apparent?', 'I remember it well. Maurice Haylett, the road manager from Caravan, came in one day, maybe 1972, ’73, with a load of guitar leads that I’d made. He threw them at me! I realized then that there was something wrong with the cable [laughs].', 'What you could buy at the time wasn’t necessarily a hundred percent effective, because of cheap construction, bad design, whatever. So the hunt was on for a crackle-free cable. Every piece of cable I saw anywhere, I snipped a bit off and tested it, until I found Belden 8422—and that was the one. I discovered a piece in an old American guitar case that somebody had left in Sound City, and luckily it just had the number embossed on it. I tested it, found that was the one, and the hunt was on.', 'That led to this other family—look at those over there, see? [Here, Pete points to a store of cables on one side of his workshop.] It’s the same family, 8412 and 8410, which are the other rubber equivalents of that PVC one.', 'Word must have spread about the guy who makes good cables.', 'Yes [laughs], and we used to make a lot at Sound City. I can’t remember how many leads we used to sell there, but it was a lot, probably 20 a day. And I had ordered 100,000 feet of that cable. It was delivered in stages, maybe 8,000 a month or something. There was none left, I know that!', 'So obviously, there was a huge market, and I’m still foolishly making these today [laughs]. Look at those amp leads. [Pete points to a box of cables further along the bench we’re sitting at.] Those are for Scorpions. They phoned up from France yesterday, said they’re coming through on Friday, so those will be ready to pick up on their way up to Manchester.', 'Where did you go after Sound City?', 'I moved to Maurice Placquet’s shop in Acton [west London] for a while, but it was too far away from the centre, so I set up on my own at 38 Long Acre in Covent Garden, about ’76, and I was there for a long time.', 'Then they cleared out the building to redevelop it, and we had to leave. I tried to go over to the west of London, but again it didn’t work, too far out of the centre.', 'This place where you are now [speaking in 1982] is certainly the area to be, very central. [Pete Cornish Musical Accessories was underneath the Marquee Studio, at 10 Richmond Mews, between Dean Street and Wardour Street.]', 'Yeah, it’s just right. And I got all my old business back.', 'I know you make whatever people want you to make, but you are best known for your pedalboards.', 'Yes, and we can look in some of my books for the details. [Pete goes to a shelf, heaves down some old ledgers, and opens the first one.] Oh look, there’s a picture of a Sound City lead tester! I take photographs of everything that I make and put them in these books. But yes, I started to make things, and that’s what I do. Bits that people can’t buy in a shop.', 'The things I make are all one-offs, impossible to mass produce. The offshoot is that I then look after the other equipment of that band. The people who I know, who are really the road managers, know that I can make things like good leads, and distribution boards, which is another thing that I make that you can’t buy in that form.', 'What was the first pedalboard?', 'There was a practice go, with Peter Banks, who I think was with Flash at that time. This would have been 1972, and I thought it would be the only time I ever would make a pedalboard [laughs], so I didn’t keep a note of it. [Pete wanders back to his shelf full of ledgers.] See, this one here had the same look, this one for David Cross [King Crimson]. The layout changed over the years.', 'Here’s another early one, just the one pedal, for John Wetton [also in King Crimson at the time]. Oh yes, I’ve got full records of all this—it was done as a set. Robert Fripp [King Crimson] was the first one. Fripp’s was my first pedalboard with batteries: one big battery to power all of it. Then he wanted a spare, and I made him a second one later on. The first was September ’73, and then the next year, in February, I made the spare.', 'How does it work when a musician comes to you for a pedalboard?', '[Pete has his nose in another of his books.] Well, look at this, a beautiful drawing by Jo Partridge [Cockney Rebel] to show me what he wanted for his pedalboard. It was wonderful to be presented with something like this.', 'Usually, when someone comes to me, we have a chat to work out what effects they want and the order they want to connect them. Then I go to my drawing board and draw an actual-size layout on tracing paper. I mark everything on that: the controls, the power lines, circuit boards, the drill holes, whatever we need to include.', 'When I make the board, I take the effects out of their cases so I can get to what’s inside: each footswitch, each set of controls, and each circuit. I put the switches at the front, and I mount the pots on etched aluminum, and then at the very back go the actual circuits, out of harm’s way [laughs].', 'Anyway, I made Jo Partridge’s pedalboard probably in 1977. He put a lot of thought into it. Four knobs for his MXR flanger, and the volume pedal was a wonderful thing, an Edwards Light Beam pedal, the first one I’d seen of that type. It was favored by the steel players in Nashville, has a bulb and a cell with a v-shaped shutter to let the variable amount of light through. Beautiful! Wish I could get a big sack of those.', 'Jo got it from America. He also had a standard Cry Baby, a Tone Bender, Phase 90, and a Dyna Comp.', 'You mentioned making Robert Fripp’s first pedalboard, in 1973. What was on that?', 'It had a Foxey Lady fuzz, which I think was a Guild version of an Electro-Harmonix Big Muff. Plus there was a Cry Baby wah and a Farfisa volume pedal. That was a wooden-bodied pedal, and what a wonderful thing. Best volume pedal I’ve ever come across. They’re very expressive, those organ pedals, and it was perfect for guitar.', 'The board had a bypass switch for the echo and the effects, but not for the volume, so the volume was left in, in circuit. The King Crimson boards were all done through Chris Kettle [road manager] at the band’s EG management.', 'Fripp’s second one had a DeArmond volume pedal on it. And it was mains powered, so that would have been later. I did the first board for Phil Manzanera [Roxy Music] a little later, in 1975. I remember that it had a no-selector-anywhere-in-the-world mains supply. Any volts from 70 through to 270—there was a circuit board that automatically selected the right volts to give the effects. And yes, it was tested and worked perfectly, giving 18 volts to the buffer stages and nine volts to the effects. It had an old Sound City Fuzz Face, MXR Phase 90, an echo send and return, and an output selector, which I remember was for the bright and normal channels of his Hiwatt.', 'So the early boards were battery powered?', 'Yes. Somewhere I have a picture of the underneath, with a screw-on plate. I used JBL T-nuts to hold it on so you could take it out and put these huge, enormous batteries in, which would last six months to a year. Because my early pedalboards had no lights on them.', 'Tell me about working with Genesis, because I know you made a board for Steve Hackett when you were still at Sound City.', 'Yes, it would have been about 1974. It had a Colorsound Octivider, Marshall Supa Fuzz, Shaftesbury Duo Fuzz, Cry Baby wah, a pre-amp, a Schaller F121 volume pedal, and the echo, which I think was an Echoplex.', 'There was also a later one, his number 2, which had an MXR Phase 90. Also around that time [Pete consults his books again] I did one for Labi Siffre, for four acoustic guitars. It had DI and output, mains powered again—and it had a footrest!', 'Mike Tomich’s board was interesting [Tomich was a bassist, probably with If at the time], and that was another early one. I heard him using that on the radio, and you could actually hear in stereo that it was working: the effects were on one channel of the stereo, and the clean feed on the other. With the wah, you could wah up and the image would shift across the stereo as you wah’d. Very nice sound—he had a Fender Blender fuzz as well, and two echo sends and returns.', 'How about the work you did for Bill Nelson, when he was still with Be-Bop Deluxe?', 'I made two boards for Bill, around 1976. The first one had a Uni-Vibe, a Little Muff, send and return for a wah, MXR Phase 100, echo, and a noise gate. But most of these boards would be modified later, and his was certainly modified many, many times.', 'I made a note here, look, of the first modification, which was to make it feed two amps. I last modified it last year, October ’81, and the original was made in September ’76—I put in a relay so that whenever he hit a Little Muff, it would automatically bring in the noise gate at the end, with one switch. The noise gate would be disengaged when that pedal was off, but it could be engaged by its own separate switch.', 'Look, there’s my note [reads]: “When Little Muff is on, noise gate is put on at same time, always, even if its own switch is off. When the Little Muff is off, the noise gate may be on or off with its own switch.” So there’s a system of diodes there that allows that relay to switch-in only in the right conditions.', 'The second board for Bill Nelson was an angled one, and it was quite nice because it had foot-controlled phase-speed and flanger-speed changes, on two rollers linked to pots. I made the rollers out of some wood with some ribbed rubber glued round it. And there were volume controls, which were not meant for permanent use like a volume pedal, but just to finely adjust it.', 'Tell me about the Pink Floyd boards, Pete.', 'Ah, the first one I made was Dave Gilmour’s large board; it was quite complicated.', 'The biggest you’d made so far?', 'Er, yes. Certainly the most effects: there was a Fuzz Face, my own fuzz, an MXR Phase 100, UniVibe, Cry Baby wah, MXR Dyna Comp, send and return for something, a volume pedal that I made, another send and return, MXR noise gate, and a very complicated system of tone pedals.', 'What do you mean by "tone pedals"?', 'Well, there was one that hung on the guitar input, and in fact that was a Telecaster tone circuit in a foot pedal, so you could alter the tone. That definitely took some trouble to do! I had to have a special pot made. Phil Taylor [Gilmour’s tech] got us a reverse pot, eventually, after we’d figured out the only way to do it was to have a backwards pot made. Nothing else would work right, because I used a Cry Baby body for it, and the gearing meant the pot was working backwards.', 'That board had three Cry Baby bodies: one used as a volume, one as the tone pedal, and one as a normal wah. Very complicated circuit, whereby the master bypass—something I’ve always put in my boards, a master switch to kill all the effects in one—could be in two positions: in one position, it bypassed everything and connected the guitar straight to the amp; in the other position of this toggle switch, the footswitch bypassed everything but the echoes, so you could be left with just echo.', 'When did you make that first Gilmour board?', 'This was when I’d moved to Long Acre, it was July ’76. From that one came all the other Floyd boards. Loads of modifications, too. I’m just looking at my book here, and there’s an interesting note from October ’77 about the MXR 90: we also put in an Electro-Harmonix Small Stone with a switch. Not the footswitch—the footswitch selects a phaser, and then this toggle switch selects which one. And there were three different echoes, too, so there was an echo switch to select echo, and then you had three choices of echoes.', 'The biggest job of all was for The Wall tour [1980–81]. It wasn’t all done at once, but it gradually became 11 pedalboards, four of which were in front of the wall: two guitar, and a mirror image. On the other side of the stage there were two bass versions for Roger Waters. Then behind the wall, there was Dave’s big board, Snowy White had one, which was Dave’s studio board. There was an auxiliary one that we used to select all the acoustic guitars, plus Roger’s board, plus another one just behind the drums, another one the other side of the drums, and two spares, the send-and-return boards.', 'I think that ended up as 11 boards on stage. Well, nine on stage, and two spares. I’ve still got the gauge for the angle of the top [laughs], so if there’s any more required I can make them the same.', 'Any more we should mention in particular?', 'I did one around ’75 for Charlie Whitney, when he was in Streetwalkers, after Family. For his board the effects were still screwed on top, he had an MXR phaser with the switches removed but the box still screwed on the top. I think that was the first one where I actually put something inside, and I think his was probably the first one with indicator lights on the footswitches. There was also an input for a tape, a volume, for effects presumably.', 'Let’s see. Oh, I did one for Big Jim Sullivan [session guitarist], probably in 1977, a six-channel foot-operated mixer. Instead of footswitches, each effect had a volume pedal, so you blend in a certain amount, with a three-channel and a two-channel mixer. It gave him some very nice sounds, particularly fuzz. There was a strong fuzz pedal, with the addition of 50 percent of the clean guitar, and that sounded really good. You could have the clean guitar going through and a small amount of fuzz to give it that edge, or you could take the clean off and let the fuzz go on its own, or a little bit of echo, and there was an octave divider and a phaser, too.', 'Tell me about some of the boards you’ve made more recently.', 'I made a nice one for Bernie Tormé, when he was with Gillan a year or two back, and that one had a lot of batteries in—occasionally people still do want that, even though it is plugged into the mains via the amp. That had to be a double supply: one for the effects and the preamps and stuff like that, and another supply for the LEDs.', 'The latest board [speaking in March 1982] was only finished last Thursday, for Dave Murray of Iron Maiden. That was an absolute panic, I was up till 2 o’clock in the morning. Next day, well, then I get a cold. My wife says I get a cold every time I make a pedalboard. Or after it.', 'Anyway, the one before Dave Murray’s was for Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath. And if I compare that to the earlier ones we talked about, I can see how things have changed. Where previously everything was screwed on top, now everything is let in to the board—except obviously a volume pedal or a wah, which needs to be on top. There’s a lid at the end, which allows you to plug in all the leads and then cover it. Stops all the leads getting trodden on.', 'Tony Iommi’s board looks as if it has some sort of multicore.', 'Yeah, I make those. It’s never been possible to buy exactly the right kind of cable, because you need mains and low-impedance balanced signal, sometimes an unbalanced signal. I’ve never found a cable that will do the whole lot, so I make it. I take the right wires—sometimes there might be some speaker leads in there, too, if there’s a voice box, say—and I take this black polymer pipe, which is French military, exceptionally strong, and I’ve never ever seen any damage.', 'I tested it the first time I got a sample, threw it on the floor, left it, humped cabinets and amps over it for a couple of months, and not a single strand was broken. Here’s some here, look. [Pete takes me over to a large box in yet another corner of the packed workshop.] These are for Queen. They just redesigned their stage, and they needed these. These are the five bass input leads, running round the drum riser. That will fit into a rack that I made them, which is in that blue case over there.', 'The top unit is the control unit, which receives the five bass signals, the signals run out to the top unit, where they’re selected, and then attenuated, and then each one is routed through to wherever they want it—Strobotuners, two valve pre-amps, two compressors—then out to two graphics, and then two power amps with lots of speakers.', 'Before that, Queen had the same sort of stuff, but spread all over the place, bits here, bits there. John Deacon was using five Acoustic 370 stacks, so again, four bass inputs with lights and switches, and a master volume and master on/off switch, so you could control the whole lot with one volume control, which seemed like a good idea. Now they have all that in one thing, and it’s easier to carry around. And one mains lead for the whole lot. So that’s an example of another type of work that I do, which is really making modifications of existing stuff. Again, it was something that was needed that you can’t just go out and buy.', 'Do you do much for keyboard players as well as guitarists and bassists?', 'Yes, I’ve done quite a bit of keyboard stuff. I did the pedalboard for Geoff Downes’s system, about 1980, when he was in Yes. At the time, he had three sides of a square with the instruments, and the fourth side the pedalboard. A couple of weeks ago I altered that, because the keyboards were opened out and added to, and now the pedalboard instead of being central is under one side. I had to take out his Morley phaser, because there was no way he could reach it. So I put a send and return in the board, and he put the phaser under where he was playing, but the board would be over there, and it’s got its own footswitch in the pedal rather than in the board. I usually take them out, you see, those integral footswitches, because it’s usually an embarrassment, it’s often better to have your own switch, then you can link it into the rest of the system more easily.', 'Do you have any views on the quality of the various pedals you’re asked to work with?', 'I don’t pass comment on things like that. I just work on whatever I’m given and try and improve it, whatever it is. If I see that there’s something not quite right, I’ll improve it. All these pedals are designed to work independently, on their own, in isolation. And usually they work very well.', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music. He is a co-founder of Backbeat UK and Jawbone Press.

At the time, it was a massive commercial and artistic success, selling more copies than any other classical recording of its era and bringing synthesizers into the mainstream of pop music. Today, the release is often called historic by all manner of music sites.', "These accolades are, of course, well-earned. But a new book argues that they barely scratch the surface of Carlos' accomplishments.", 'Roshanak Kheshti, the author of the new 33 1/3 book series entrant Wendy Carlos\'s Switched-On Bach, says Carlos was and remains a "foundational presence" to electronic music—and that the brief public acknowledgements she often garners today fall far short of the full story.', 'In fact, Kheshti explains, Carlos collaborated closely with Bob Moog to modify and shape the synthesizers she then introduced to the wider world. Her sophisticated sense of sound design not only influenced future synths but the trajectory of whole genres of future artists. And her technical mastery of audio engineering and home-studio recording was a harbinger of the DIY record-making to come.', "In her volume's pages and an interview with Reverb, Kheshti discusses just how much listeners and synth fans miss when they hear Switched-On Bach simply as a historical footnote.", "Recorded throughout 1968 before its October release, Switched-On Bach contains compositions Carlos chose for their melodies and openness to orchestration. It was produced by Carlos and Rachel Elkind—who initially suggested an album's worth of Bach synth songs after Carlos played one for her. It features mainly Carlos' own playing, along with some passages performed by Benjamin Folkman.", "While studying at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in the early '60s, Carlos had been taught that serious composers were interested in serialism—atonal, non-repeating passages that were thought then to represent the far reaches of contemporary Western music. As used there and in other halls of academia for such work, synthesizers were instruments of chirps, squelches, blips, and little more. Carlos wanted no part of it.", "After meeting Moog in 1964, Carlos became a confidant and instructor. (Her first recording, released prior to Switched-On Bach, was actually a demo record for Moog modules.) She traded her time and skills for modules of her own, and then decided to use Bach's Baroque harmonic structure to bring bright, melodious synthesis to life.", 'The source material and the resultant album was about as far from the cold, academic compositions as she could get. To Kheshti, the Moog tones Carlos was able to create for the first track of Switched-On Bach are a preamble to the electronic pop music of the late 20th century. She writes:', '', '', "The worlds of instrumentation Carlos was able to conjure are all the more impressive when you know the limitations of the Moog synthesizer at the time—and the extent of Carlos' own contributions to it.", '"Analog synthesizers are shape-shifters notoriously difficult to tame. Whereas some synthesizers include preprogrammed settings and sounds accessible with the touch of a button, the Moog 900’s patch bays, switches, knobs, and dials allow for infinite sonic possibilities that are very difficult to replicate with any exactitude," writes Kheshti.', 'Carlos\' custom-built system, consisting of many 900 series modules, was the result of her close working relationship with Moog. They began building the system in 1966. According to Moog\'s website, "Carlos worked with Bob Moog throughout the album’s recording process, testing instrument components and making suggestions for improvements that would shape the future of the Moog modular system design and sound" like the commercially available IIIp.', 'Speaking more than three decades after the great shift she inspired, Carlos said, "The technology also moved on, and the special modules and devices we had to custom build to allow our synth to be an expressive, flexible instrument, are assumed as the norm: everyone has them."', 'Carlos refers to this expressive quality as the "performance value" of the instrument, Kheshti explains, "something that brings in a musician as a critical element to the instrument design." When Moog was first building his modules, he did so very much as an engineer, and credited Carlos as being one of the primary musicians among many others that pushed him to make it more musical.', 'On her own website, Carlos offers some remembrances of this time: "Ever modest, Bob always deferred on musical matters to those of us who came from that side of the art/tech equation. We, on the other hand, deferred to Bob on all engineering decisions and designs. From the beginning it was a balanced yin/yang relationship between a maker of musical tools and the artists who used those tools."', "The biggest result of their years of collaboration was Moog's touch-sensitive keyboard. Developed alongside Carlos throughout the making of Switched-On Bach, it was the first time a synth keyboard processed velocity information—a stark contrast to the simple on-off keys that electronic organs used at the time, and that would remain the norm for years. Today, of course, velocity-sensitive keys on a synth are a given.", '"To get the first one though, I worked rather closely with Bob Moog starting in mid-1967," Carlos said. "The final version was rather mechanical and clunky by modern electronic keyboard standards but it did work and it still does. It had both depth and velocity sensing and these could be used to control the volume and timbre naturally and expressively as one performed."', "Moog's first fixed-filter bank, the 907—a collection of attenuators at fixed frequency bands—was also Carlos' suggestion.", 'Where previous synthesizer works leaned into the new sounds of the instruments, Carlos wanted to bring out the timbres and tonalities of acoustic instruments while going beyond mere mimicry.', "In her book, Kheshti shows the exacting nature of Carlos' sound design, and the various misconceptions about synthesis Carlos had to fight constantly. The most persistent was that the synthesizer was automated, or somehow doing most of the work itself.", "To begin with the basics, Carlos' expert use of then-new modules to approximate sounds of acoustic instruments was unheard-of. Later synths of the '70s and '80s would include presets for brass and strings, but these were still years off. It was her ear and her understanding of the most basic elements of sound that made it possible.", 'Carlos succinctly explained her mastery to an awed New Age Voice magazine writer, Carol Wright, in 1999:', "Carlos: The Moog wasn't all that elaborate. There were a couple of oscillators, and you adjusted them to track the octaves. You would pick a wave shape from the four available: sine, triangle, pulse wave, and sawtooth. There was a white noise source, and a filter to reduce the high end of the wave, to make it sound more mellow, to add resonance, or take out the bottom. Then there were envelopers that came from Ussachevsky's ideas: attack time, decay, sustain, and release. Set the thing to ramp up at some rate: slow for an organ or fast for a plucked string. Make it decay immediately for a harpsichord, or sustain for a piano. Have the final release time based on the need, short and dry, or longer for the vibrating body of a cello or drum. Easy.", 'NAV: Right. Piece-a-cake.', 'Through her sound design, Carlos "socialize[d] the Moog," Kheshti writes.', '"Much like mother’s role in the traditional nuclear family—as the nurturing translator of father’s rules—Carlos had a unique ability to translate the arcane and technical mechanics of the Moog 900 to sound colors that were legible to audiences," Kheshti writes. "The violin, the trumpet, the human voice—it wasn’t just that Carlos’s perfectly tuned ear could mimic acoustic sounds, but that she understood the social order of things and \'what is audibly important,\' as she put it."', "However, while Carlos was enamored by the challenge of recreating acoustic sounds, she understood that synthesis was a new medium. She combatted critics' notions that all she was doing was mimicking an orchestra.", '"Carlos understood herself to be like a painter," Kheshti tells Reverb, one who knows that even though they\'re painting a still life, they are imparting their own perspective and artistry on the subject matter. Kheshti unearthed a vintage Whole Earth Catalog quote from Carlos that further illustrates the point:', '"Many people suggest to me that I constantly \'limit myself to imitating real instruments.\' Bull shit. The easiest to obtain sounds (three or four patch cords on the Moog, for ex.) are all those dreary \'new\' sounds. I’ve rarely tried to actually \'imitate\' traditional musical instruments—I’ve always used them as a point of departure and then veered off into subtly different areas. ... \'Gee, that Picasso paints weird "flowers," don’t he?!\'"', "When listening to Switched-On Bach today, it's easy to overlook the incredible amount of time that must have gone into recording it. It's a fully orchestrated, polyphonic album made from a monophonic instrument—recorded measure-by-measure, a few notes at a time, and overdubbed to symphonic heights.", "More astonishing is the fact that the painstaking process was not conducted at the Columbia-Princeton sound lab or in one of New York City's professional recording studios but in Carlos' own apartment, on Manhattan's Upper West Side.", '"Carlos really began as an engineer. While she was getting her master\'s at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center, she was engineering records on the side, and so she was already a professional audio engineer before she started this project and started to design [her home] studio," Kheshti says. "This really gave her the know-how to correct for some of the acoustic problems that come with electronic music. And this was a knowledge that very few people had in the mid-\'60s."', 'Switched-On Bach was not the first hit record made in a home studio. The Tornados\' "Telstar" was recorded in producer Joe Meek\'s London flat, and Les Paul\'s many hits were multi-tracked in his Los Angeles garage. But Carlos\' living-room setup was the first to include a modular synth and account for all its attendant oddities.', 'Much as she had done with the Moog, Carlos customized her recording equipment too—giving her and Elkind eight-track recording capabilities at a time when even Abbey Road was still using four-track recorders.', 'Her equipment list in 1968, according to Carlos\' website, included an Ampex eight-track recorder that "had just been assembled from an assortment of used parts and home-built additions ... a small Lafayette tube amp kit for monitoring ... [and] a homemade pullout mixing board." The mixing board would roll out below her two custom touch-sensitive keyboards.', 'Kheshti says she didn\'t have access to any formal recording logs, if they even exist, but that it\'s clear that the amount of recording, overdubbing, mixing down, and what Carlos simply called "orchestration" was a meticulous effort.', '"The home studio became necessary in order to commit every waking hour to problem-solving around that," Kheshti says. "In some ways, this record was like a startup. Because, basically, they lived together, they lived with this record, they lived in the studio... it appears that they did nothing but work on this record. And I think it\'s audible—it\'s evident—that every waking hour for several years was spent developing the technique necessary to work with this limited recording media."', 'Carlos would continue to add to her studio, which later moved with her to other homes, for years—using it for most of her future work like the scores for The Clockwork Orange and The Shining.', '"The ubiquity of the home studio today, I think, is a little bit surprising, because it was certainly not ubiquitous at the time when she established hers. One of the claims that I\'m making in the book is that she is partly, I think, to be credited for the establishment of the home studio as a phenomenon, that now we almost see as the dominant studio model," Kheshti says.', 'There were plenty of people recording at home before this, of course. "But the quality of the recording is incomparable. I think her ability to correct for signal noise and various kinds of bleeding—there\'s no comparison with any other home recording."', "Read more about Wendy Carlos' pioneering work in Kheshti's Wendy Carlos's Switched-On Bach.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

He didn't have much choice, really, because the body of the guitar they gave him was made of solid clear plastic. If he held it up to his face, he could see the rest of the Stones waving to him. When he tried it on stage—aside from its playability, which he loved—he probably noticed the way the lights would dance all over it.", "In the heady late '60s, these new plastic-body guitars must have seemed like a possible version of the future. Maybe the days were numbered when only wood could be used for a good professional guitar?", "In fact, a plastic electric guitar wasn't a new idea. In the '30s, Rickenbacker's George Beauchamp hit upon Bakelite, the first synthetic plastic, a hard phenolic resin popularized for household objects. George used it for the firm's Model B Hawaiian steel and the Electro Spanish, launched in 1932 and today considered historically as the first non-steel solidbody electric guitar.", 'Later, Valco in Chicago introduced a line of electrics, in 1962, with molded fiberglass bodies, including the stylish National "map shape" models. That same year, Ampeg made a fiberglass-body electric upright bass, the Baby Bass.', 'Ampeg\'s Dan Armstrong models, however, were the first commercial solidbody electrics to have clear plastic bodies, and that certainly made them stand out. The Ampeg company dated back to the \'40s, set up in New York City by Everett Hull to make amplifiers and upright-bass pickups. Everett came up with the company\'s name from the "amplified peg" of his amplification system that put a mic inside the pointed "peg" or spike of an upright bass.', 'Ampeg first tried to get into the electric guitar market in 1963, importing four Burns guitar models from Britain—the Jazz Split Sound, Nu-Sonic, Split Sonic, and TR-2—which were the same as the UK originals apart from an Ampeg logo on the pickguard. Few were sold, and the deal ended a year later.', 'Ampeg next introduced some distinctive-looking bass guitars in 1966, the fretted AEB-1 and the first commercial fretless electric bass, the AUB-1, both with transducer-style pickups under the bridge (later variants had regular magnetic pickups). There was also the ASB-1 "devil bass" with distinctive slim, pointy body horns.', 'By 1967, Ampeg was owned by Unimusic, who fancied another try with guitars to sell alongside the brand\'s popular amps. They came across Dan Armstrong, and in \'68 asked him for some advice about the guitar business. Dan was a respected guitar repairer with a busy workshop, originally across the street from Manny\'s on New York\'s 48th Street "music row," but by now on Laguardia Place in Greenwich Village. His shop was well-known to many of the city\'s musicians and a lot of touring players. Dan also worked as a session guitarist and bassist in NYC: That\'s him playing bass on Ohio Express\'s "Yummy, Yummy, Yummy," for example.', "At a NAMM show in Chicago, a friend of Dan's who worked for Ampeg gave him a quick tour of the company's current efforts, and Dan suggested he might design some new electric guitars for them. A deal was struck. With help from Matt Umanov (the guitar itself) and Bill Lawrence (the pickups), Dan set to work making prototypes for Ampeg to consider.", 'He decided to carve the bodies of the new instruments from blocks of transparent Lucite, just as if they were wood. Lucite was an acrylic plastic known technically as polymethyl methacrylate and sold under various trade names, including Plexiglas and Perspex as well as Lucite. "I just wanted to be as original as possible," he told Jeffrey Pike in Guitar magazine in 1973, "not to copy anybody\'s anything."', "Dan's quest for originality certainly created a distinctive-looking instrument, but he also wanted to exploit what he saw as the advantages of the non-standard body material. In Beat Instrumental in '73, he explained how he'd searched for a rigid material, based on the idea that rigid steel guitars sustained well. He wanted something very hard, and concluded that wood varied too much.", '"I came up with good old plastic," he said, "which I figured we ought to be able to mold. In fact, we had to machine the body to shape, and it cost a lot to cut and polish one of those bodies out of a solid block of acrylic plastic. It\'s not easy stuff to work with, but our end product was a really nice looking piece of plastic."', 'Ampeg\'s \'69 catalogue for the new See-Through guitar and bass said that acrylic plastic was "so dense it virtually eliminates all unwanted vibrations and frequencies" and that the body was "practically maintenance free, with no paint to chip off." The company\'s instructions suggested that if the body did somehow become scratched, the best way to deal with this was to polish it with toothpaste—surely a first in guitar care techniques.', 'Ampeg\'s brochure went on to suggest that there were sonic benefits to be had, too, from the brave new world of transparent plastic bodies. "The ability to sustain notes extremely well is due to the considerable mass of the material," it said, carefully avoiding the word "heavy."', 'The guitar and bass models each had a bolt-on maple neck and rosewood fingerboard with small-dot inlays, and both were early instances of 24-fret fingerboards, making for two full octaves (24 3/4-inch scale on the guitar; 30 1/2-inch on the bass), and the deep cutaways provided access to the highest of those frets.', 'Another unusual feature of Ampeg\'s See-Through ARMG-1 guitar (not the bass) was the opportunity for the player to use one of six interchangeable pickups in its single-pickup slot. They were designed by Bill Lawrence and called Rock, Country, or Jazz, each in Treble or Bass versions. "We wanted a pickup that produced a tone that pleased everybody," Ampeg explained. "This was much too difficult, so we offer six quite different pickups, each with quite a different sound."', "At first, two pickups were supplied with each new See-Through guitar, a Rock Treble and a Country Bass, and others could be bought as accessories from Ampeg dealers. To change pickups, the player had to loosen a small thumb-screw at the back, gently slide the existing pickup out of the sloping slot cut into the face of the body, slide another pickup in, guiding the body plugs into the pickup's holes, and tighten the rear screw. The See-Through ARMB-1 bass was more conventional in that its single pickup was a fixed unit (although with a bit of fiddling it could be relatively easily disconnected if it failed), but also, and rather less conventionally for the time, it was a stacked humbucker.", 'A little more period vibe came with the pickguard, which was a piece of woodgrain Formica plastic laminate. The material, more familiar from furniture and worktops of the era, was also used to face the neat three-a-side headstock, which housed the truss-rod adjuster under a small plate. The pickguard had the controls and jack fitted to its underside, Fender-style, for ease of production. There was the expected pair of volume and tone knobs, but Ampeg insisted on a switch as well, even though these were single-pickup instruments. Dan made the most of this demand and provided various tone and standby options from a three-way (and later a two-way on the bass).', 'The See-Through guitar and bass each listed for $290 upon their launch in 1969, rising to $340 in 1970, when a fretless version of the bass, the ARMUB-1, was added. There were also a handful of guitars and basses made with black plastic bodies.', "Keith Richards got his See-Through guitar late in 1969 during rehearsals with his band's new guitarist, Mick Taylor. The Stones needed new stage gear for the upcoming tour, and along with some welcome Ampeg amps came the guitar for Keith. The model he was given can be spotted in period photos and footage by its prototype white pickup, where the production versions are brown. Keith apparently took to his new six-string straight away, and it became an important guitar for him during the next few years.", 'Ampeg was, of course, delighted by such high-profile visibility of its new product, and the firm featured Keith in advertising. The image of Keith and See-Through must have helped to persuade others to give the transparent solidbody a try through the years, and they include Greg Ginn, Cyril Jordan, Alanis Morissette, Joe Perry, Tom Petty, Randy Rhoads, Rick Richards, Johnny Thunders, and Tom Verlaine. Bill Wyman, meanwhile, got one of the basses but didn\'t use it for long, complaining that it was too heavy for him. Other bassists drawn to the look of the See-Throughs and not so fussy about their "considerable mass" included Jack Bruce (fretless), Geezer Butler, and Rick Price.', 'Despite all the invention and innovation, the imaginative Ampeg Dan Armstrong See-Through models lasted little more than a year in production, dropped in 1971 and not helped by conservative players and a relatively expensive manufacturing process. Dan closed his Village shop that same year and moved to the UK, returning to America in 1975. Among other things, he made some more Dan Armstrong instruments, various amps, and a line of small Sound Modifiers effects boxes that plugged into the guitar jack.', 'Ampeg reissued the See-Throughs in 1999 for a few years, again in 2006, and once more for the 40th anniversary in 2009, with pickups by Dan\'s son, Kent Armstrong. Dan died in 2004. "When you\'re repairing things," he told Jeffrey Pike back in the \'70s, "if you\'re a susser you say, \'Ah, this should have been made better to begin with,\' and you figure out how to rebuild it instead of just repairing it."', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

In one of the most famous hip-hop examples of over-perfectionism leading to inaction, Dr. Dre worked on Detox—an album Rolling Stone journalist Mosi Reeves dubbed "the Chinese Democracy of rap"—for a decade plus.', 'Despite a star-studded cast that included Mary J. Blige, Kendrick Lamar, and Lil Wayne, and assurances from collaborator Scott Storch in a 2004 MTV News article that Detox would be "the most advanced rap album musically and lyrically we\'ll probably ever have a chance to listen to," an official release has yet to see the light of day.', 'Thankfully for rap music fans, not every project is relegated to the vaults for having some slight imperfections or being a bit rough around the edges. In fact, rap and sample-based music production both have a long history of fortuitous mistakes that ended up benefiting the creative process.', "Though it may not have been the artist's intent at the time, mistakenly included snare drums, accidental silence, incorrect drum programming, random jam sessions inspired by computer crashes, and unintentional MPC pad pressing have all helped spawn important records in the modern music canon.", 'Such happy accidents can be traced all the way back to rap\'s original super-producer and early beatmaking innovator Marley Marl, who mistakenly discovered the art of sampling during a mixing session for Captain Rock\'s "Cosmic Blast" record in 1984. As Marley worked on getting the mix just right, he wanted to record a single riff off a vinyl record to enhance the instrumental. Without realizing it, he accidentally left a snare drum at the beginning of the segment before the desired sample started playing.', 'As he truncated the vinyl snippet while a programmed drumbeat played in the background, Marley realized how crisp the accidental snare from the record sounded. The moment was a true revelation. "It just smacked me in the face what just happened," he told Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Frannie Kelley in a 2013 Microphone Check interview. "I was like, \'Hold up!\' This will enable me to take any kick and a snare from any record that people love and make my own beat."', "Marley Marl was far from the only production pioneer to make an ear-pleasing mistake. Prince Paul, who co-produced De La Soul's critically acclaimed first three albums and masterminded The Gravediggaz extremely dark and brilliant 1994 effort 6 Feet Deep, also missed the technical mark in a way that was essential to the creation of early rap records.", 'In a 2008 Smoking Section interview, Paul recalled the prevalence of minor errors in De La Soul\'s sample-rich 1989 debut 3 Feet High and Rising that helped give the music some added charm. Paul pointed an unintended beat drop on the album\'s hit single "Me Myself and I," that occurred as he and Posdnuos mixed the song by hand without the benefit of automation.', '"There was a part where one of us was supposed to leave the beat in, and we forgot," he told The Smoking Section. "We just looked at each other, threw it back in on time, and said, \'Eh, that\'s good enough.\'"', "Paul's willingness to accept imperfections was reenforced when a cool-sounding misstep led to a key track on 3rd Bass' The Cactus Album, a critical and commercial success that came out eight months after 3 Feet High and Rising.", 'With a grand total of 21 songs included on the record, singles like "Steppin\' to the A.M." made some noise through radio and music video, while "The Gas Face" also proved to be one of the true breakout singles from the group\'s debut effort. According to Paul, the reason the drum pattern has a unique shuffle is because of a misstep in his programming on the original 4-track version.', 'Despite the fact that the percusion sequence was unintentional, the members of 3rd Bass balked when Paul suggested that he should fix it. "I was going to change it, but [MC] Serch and Pete [Nice] said, "Yo, that\'s crazy. We really like it how it is," he told Eric Thurm in a 2013 A.V. Club interview. Paul left it as-is, and 30 years later it remains one of the group\'s most well-known songs.', "Some six years later, Paul's fellow Native Tongues affiliate Ali Shaheed Muhammad and D'Angelo made one of the best songs from 1995 because of a technological glitch.", "As the duo worked on D'Angelo's Brown Sugar debut in Battery Studios' Studio C room, the computer system crashed—a frequent occurrence according to journalist Michael Gonzales' excellent 2010 Wax Poetics cover story on the making of the album.", "While an engineer scrambled to get the computer up and running again, D'Angelo started messing around with his Ensoniq EPS 16+ keyboard sampler, the precursor to the famous ASR-10 popularized by folks like Alchemist, The Neptunes, Jake One, RZA, Timbaland, Kanye West, and countless others.", 'Without giving it much thought, D\'Angelo started playing out random progressions and sequences with no particular goal in mind. All of a sudden he played something that made Muhammad stop in his tracks. "Even he wasn\'t aware of what exactly he was playing, he just had his hands on the keyboard," Muhammad told Wax Poetics. "When I asked him what he was playing, he said, \'Nothing.\'"', 'Luckily, Muhammad had a DAT tape recording nonstop during sessions to capture such moments of divine creativity. Sensing they had something interesting on their hands, the two artists worked together to build out what would eventually become "Brown Sugar," a moment that left Muhammad in awe. "It was like it was too good to be true, because that song came out of 20 minutes and a mistake."', "A decade and change later, recent Roots addition Stro Elliot found himself prepping for a Root Down beat battle with a different Ensoniq sampler, which provided him with a happy accident of his own. As he loaded in a classic '90s R&B song into his ASR-X sampler, he toyed with the failed MPC competitor's ability to extend the end of a sample. In his experimentation he unintentionally stumbled upon a perfect combination, where he looped the sample forward and in reverse right at a heightened moment of emotion in the acapella.", 'This sample flip became the ideal foundation for some hard-hitting drums and Korg Triton synths, which eventually lead to a fully fleshed out beat that came together in an instant. "I want to say it was one of the quickest things I\'ve ever made," he told Micro-Chop in a January 2017 interview. "It kind of fell together."', 'In addition to making the crowd and judges at the March 2007 Root Down battle lose their collective minds when he premiered the track, Elliot considers what is now dubbed "Soul II Stro" one of the most important records from his production discography—in large part because of the love DJs showed it during their live sets. "It\'s probably opened more doors than any other track that I know because of the DJs," he told Micro-Chop. "All the DJs I know love that track and play that track."', 'As the 2000s wore on, producers weren\'t done turning mistakes into musical victories. Just check out Alchemist\'s 2009 album Chemical Warfare—and make sure to pay special attention to the unexpected collaboration with Three 6 Mafia and Juvenile titled "That\'ll Work."', 'Give Alchemist\'s MPC padwork a close listen and you might think the mind-boggling speed and dexterity required to pull off such a fast and complex sequence defies human comprehension. According to Alchemist, not so. "I could have never programmed it like that," he told the AllHipHop staff in a 2009 interview. "It was some mistake shit."', 'If the programming isn\'t an intentional showcase of MPC mastery, how exactly did Alchemist get the beat to sound the way it did? It turns out the process was pretty straightforward. "I had a sample on the MPC and I held on to all 32 buttons with my hands and the chopped sound goes, \'Doo-loo-loo,\'" he told AllHipHop. "So I just pressed record and I put my whole hand on the MPC pads."', 'The same year Alchemist was holding his hand down on MPC pads at once and collaborating with Memphis and New Orleans rap royalty, Boi-1da was in Toronto composing breakthrough tracks for Drake in FL Studio.', 'His philosophy on his early productions was to focus on the percussion while resisting the urge to overcomplicate the sound. "I don\'t really \'cluster\' my beats," he told Drew Hinshaw in a 2009 Keyboard Magazine interview. "People enjoy the simplicity. Simple always wins."', 'His dedication to simple, hard-hitting, drums helped in the making of Drake\'s early multi-platinum single "Over," but Boi-1da\'s mistaken use of the wrong box on the FL Studio grid proved to be the big difference maker. "I accidentally dragged the snare into the kick box and it sounded like reggae," he told Keyboard Magazine. "So I kept it there. It has a new kind of bounce that hasn\'t been implemented in hip-hop before."', "Each of these stories teach a valuable lesson about the importance of embracing occasional imperfections in music. Mistakes can actually give a song added texture or an interesting twist that the creator wouldn't have thought of otherwise. Though it might be stressful for artists to leave unfixed errors in their hard work for the world to hear, the above songs are proof that sometimes it's worth it in the end.", "Instead of rushing to fix a mistake the next time you're working on a beat, take a moment or two to sit with it. Who knows what it might morph into by the time you're done.", 'About the author: Gino Sorcinelli is the writer, creator, and editor of Micro-Chop, a Substack newsletter that dissects beatmaking, DJing, music production, rapping, and sampling.

Go back to the early 20th century, and drums were still supposed to be played individually. Such luxuries as kick pedals or cymbal stands were a glint in some bass-strapped marching band drummer's eyes.", 'Below, we look at six crucial developments between that era and the modern drum kit.', "Ulysses Grant Leedy's seminal drum company was formed in Indianapolis in 1898, but it's a name no longer familiar to modern drum set players. Leedy was, however, a prime instigator in shaping our beloved drum set. Among his more prosaic innovations is the humble snare drum stand.", 'Prior to Leedy, the snare drum was indeed the "side" drum, slung from the swarthy shoulders of the marching military man, while in orchestra pits the snare drum might be placed on a chair. It was crying out for a specialized stand, and Leedy obliged with his 1896 patent for a practical folding stand.', "Don't sniff! The concept was seminal, a crucial step away from the centuries-old mindset that individual drums and cymbals were separate items of percussion. Leedy's stand helped move toward the unified concept of the drum set, to be played by a single individual rather than a percussion section (the method that persists today in field drums and symphonic percussion).", 'The next gargantuan step (pun intended) in formulating the kit involved playing the bass drum with the foot and not the hands. Legendary New Orleans drummers such as Warren "Baby" Dodds began placing the big marching bass drum upright on the floor and using the foot to stomp out the beat.', 'Some drummers struggled with unwieldy, slow, lashed-up gadgets slung from the top hoop of the bass drum. The breakthrough came in 1909 with the nifty pedal that would launch the Ludwig name toward its later boast: "The Most Famous Name On Drums."', 'William and Theobald Ludwig were brothers and both professional percussionists (and the Chicago agents for U.G. Leedy). The elder William found himself struggling to keep up with the lively ragtime tempos of the day, and like Leedy before him, he decided to take matters into his own hands.', 'He fabricated a floor pedal from wood which attached to the bottom of the hoop, and it had a short beater stroke for speedier response.', "William's prototype was immediately successful, and he enlisted engineer Robert Danly (later to become his brother-in-law), who made the pedal in metal. The unit could be folded flat and was small, light, neat, and easily transportable. Hey presto: Now we had the basis of the modern instrument. Selling like hot cakes, the Ludwig pedal set the pattern for several decades.", 'The early drum kit was bound up not only with jazz, but also with the vast circuit of vaudeville and silent-movie theaters. Music for these shows was invariably provided by a pianist and a percussionist—and the percussionist was expected to supply all manner of sound effects, which explains the early "traps" kit with klaxons, temple blocks, duck calls, and the rest.', "All of that gradually became obsolete with the arrival of movies with sound, followed by the next big thing in music: swing. With its driving beat and outrageous dance moves, swing was the rock 'n' roll of the late '30s.", "The clarinetist and bandleader Benny Goodman emerged as the unlikely pinup of swing, while his drummer, Gene Krupa, made an arguably bigger splash. Goodman had the perfect face for radio, but Krupa had the charisma of a matinee idol. Krupa's hard-swing drumming had no need for those novelty sound effects; he brought drumming to the fore with his sensational tom solos.", 'To maximize this style, Krupa hooked up with Slingerland, based in his hometown of Chicago and a competitor to Ludwig. He persuaded them to build him a sleek drum set with the first properly double-headed toms—in other words, toms tunable both top and bottom. The resulting Radio King set provided the blueprint for the drum kit and remains the standard design today.', 'Meantime, there was the matter of shell construction. For centuries, side drums and bass drums were made by steam-bending a single plank of wood into the round, and then stabilizing it with wooden reinforcing rings inserted top and bottom.', 'The Gretsch company in Brooklyn realized that plywood is structurally tougher than solid wood, and so its use in a thin drum shell could enable a shell without reinforcing rings to stay circular. By staggering the ply joins around the shell, the structure could be made strong enough to hold true. Gretsch thus introduced the so-called "straight-sided" shell: one without the need for reinforcing rings, which cause obstructions at the top and bottom bearing edges.', "Starting with three plies in 1920, Gretsch eventually settled on its definitive six-ply shell during the '50s. This was roughly the same thickness as three-ply—around a quarter of an inch—but each ply was thinner. And this layup is still used today. Other companies did change to ply in the '20s, but most kept the reinforcing rings right through to the '70s. Although re-rings have made a limited comeback in recent years, the majority of modern professional shells follow the straight-sided Gretsch formula of a thin shell with a mean number of plies hovering around six.", 'While drum shells are (generally) made from wood, everything else in the kit is metal. As drumming got tougher and louder, so the metalwork lagged behind—particularly the supporting brackets and stands. Just as early rock drummers were actually jazz drummers slumming it, so the kit was a jazz instrument given a rude pummeling by the likes of Keith Moon. Actually, never mind Keith—Buddy Rich was already subjecting every kit in his path to the shock of its life. Something was lacking. And, of course, it was all that metal.', 'Buddy Rich became a Rogers endorser a couple of years after designer Joe Thompson and marketing man Ben Strauss devised the groundbreaking Rogers Swiv-O-Matic hardware in 1957. This was the first all-encompassing drum hardware system, utilizing hexagonal steel rods and hardened steel oval-shaped balls and sockets to lock toms in place. The universal Swivo concept extended to stands and pedals. A picture series in the 1960 catalogue showed a drummer carrying an entire kit, all held together by Swiv-O-Matic components.', "Such was the success of Swiv-O-Matic that it transcended Rogers' own drums and was routinely fitted to drum sets of many other brands. In the '60s, Swivo brackets could be seen fitted to Moon's Premiers and Ringo's and Ginger Baker's Ludwigs, and in fact any number of drummers insisted on Swivo hardware, whatever the make of drums they favored.", 'Until the \'70s, most (though certainly not all) drummers had little or no idea what species of wood their drum shells employed. Drum manufacturers simply used the most appropriate lumber available, generally hiding it beneath pearl or sparkle wraps. Inside, particularly with American drums, shells were painted silver, grey, or white. Then, in the late \'70s, Yamaha of Japan pulled a masterstroke by transferring its superior expertise in block-color piano lacquering to its drum shells. Yamaha declared that the Hokkaido birch from which their shells were made was the ultimate "recording" wood and even that it was naturally "pre-EQ\'d."', "This captured the spirit of the times, with the rise in recording sophistication and the awareness among fans of the brilliant session musicians who were finally emerging as stars in their own right. In the drumming world, Steve Gadd reigned supreme, and he championed Yamaha's Recording Custom RC9000 drums. They were a sensation, taking off worldwide and changing forever the way drummers viewed their shells. The 9000 became the model for drum shells over the next decade.", "Ironically, the American drums played on classic recordings of the previous 50 years mostly had mahogany or maple shells. Birch was the staple of Northern Europe. But following Yamaha's success, every company would now advertise the type of wood in its shells as a major selling point. Birch was followed by a return to North American maple, and today birch and maple remain the staples, to which a plethora of exotic timbers have been added.", "About the author: Geoff Nicholls is a musician, author, journalist, and lecturer based in London. He played drums on BBC2 TV's award-winning Rockschool in 1984 and 1987 and wrote Byte The Music for BBC Radio 3, which won first prize at the New York Radio Festival in 1994.

It follows previous interviews with others involved in the pre-CBS golden age of Fender production and in the post-CBS revival years:", 'I interviewed Bill Carson (1926–2007) when I was researching my first book about Fender in 1992. Bill was a Western swing guitarist who moved to California from his native Oklahoma in the early ‘50s, playing with Hank Thompson, Spade Cooley, Wade Ray, and many others. Western swing was a lively dance music that grew in Texas dancehalls during the ‘30s and ‘40s, and its guitarists popularized the electric guitar in America, at first mostly with steel guitars.', 'Soon after his move West, Bill hooked up with Fender and became one of the company’s valuable musical guinea pigs, trying out new products and offering ideas. He went full-time at Fender in ’57, at first in the plant, later setting up the firm’s first service centers and artist relations teams. He retired in 2001. Bill always claimed a strong influence on the development of the Stratocaster, and when we met I wanted to hear his side of that story.', 'Bill, can you recall when and where you first met Leo Fender, and in what circumstances?', 'I looked up Leo in 1951, when I moved to that area of California, to get him to build me a guitar. I had seen and played a Broadcaster and I really liked the action, the neck feel, the sound of the instrument generally. His factory, as I remember it, consisted of two cinder-block buildings that had tin roofs on them. They were near the railroad tracks in Fullerton, on Pomona Street, and there weren’t any restrooms. I remember that [laughs] about the place. Employees—I think there were about 10 or 12 at the time—had to use the Santa Fe Depot restrooms, and they were located across two sets of tracks. And, of course, the inevitable happened. Old Mr. Pearce—he was the only sheet-metal shop worker we had at that time, he did all the die-work and stuff—well, he couldn’t make it. So Leo rented a portable toilet the next day.', 'You’ve got to keep in mind that the company was very poor, with very little cash flow from the few items being produced then. The most profitable one was a six-string Champ lap-style steel guitar, that’s where about all the money was coming from. Since Leo couldn’t tune or play a guitar—however, he did once play clarinet in college—he was very eager to have me listen to some of his experiments, which I did for, oh, I guess two or three months, a few hours each day. I’d offer opinions on what sounded good or bad and what felt right or wrong, and generally critique from a player’s point of view the things that he found difficult to measure. Measuring devices in those days consisted of an oscilloscope, a sweep generator, and that was about it. So you had to depend on a guy’s ears or a musician’s ears to know what he was hearing.', 'I didn’t have the money to buy an amp and guitar outright, so Leo sold me a Telecaster and an amp for 18 bucks a month, with the understanding that I would spend a few hours each week as a musical guinea pig. He wrote our agreement on a yellow tablet sheet and stuck it in an old rickety file cabinet. And that was our contract.', 'Did your later meetings take place at the Fender factory?', 'Later meetings turned into months of several hours daily at the shop, plus taking prototype amps to the club where I was working with a band about five hours every night. The prototypes were crude and rarely had numbers to reference on the faceplate for tone, volume, mid-range, and any other kinds of control they had on them. So it was trial and error for the most part to get the thing set right.', 'To get it sounding right it took some time, usually about the first set. We’d get it set up where it sounded good, and it seemed to never fail that as soon as that happened, and I’d got it to what I thought was a pretty good sound, Leo would come in the club. He’d come on up on the bandstand and reset my amp to make it sound “better,” or so he thought. And he was just oblivious of other musicians, club management, and disruption generally when he wanted his amplifier to sound better.', 'He was terribly caught up in wanting to improve sound for the musician, but I sure hated to see him walk in the club where I was playing, because all my amp settings were about to be wrecked [laughs]. And he did that. I kinda got around that problem by using small bits of surgical tape [laughs] as reference points on the control knobs and the faceplates.', 'Leo would visit the clubs pretty often where I was working, and sometimes he would bring another amplifier in at that time and want me to exchange it for the one that I had. He’d take the other one, and take it back to the shop sometimes in the middle of the night to work on it. I just never knew anybody that was as involved in what they were doing and live it 24 hours a day.', 'What did you think of Leo at the time? What sort of person did he seem to you?', 'He was a difficult person to characterize, since he didn’t fit any set of personality traits or criteria. I never heard him raise his voice in anger, but he could quietly just strip the skin off anyone with a few well chosen words. I heard that several times.', 'Once an employee wasn’t wearing safety goggles at a grinding machine. Leo had lost an eye when he was younger and was very sensitive to people protecting their eyesight, and I remember he raked that particular guy over really well. And one time a stockbroker had guessed wrong over a small stock purchase that Leo had made, and Leo quietly suggested that he should seek other employment. He was that kind of a guy. He didn’t shout or raise his voice, but he got things done.', 'I think the bond that was between Leo and myself was based really on total honesty on what was needed in music. That was the thing that we had in common. He was striving to do the very best that he could for musicianship, to make his products ahead of the pack, and he knew that the working musician was the secret to all of that.', 'He must have figured early on, Bill, how important it was to get opinions from a range of musicians.', 'Yes, Leo had an uncanny sense of interpreting a musician’s needs in terms of electronics, mechanics, feel, and sound. I just never in my life time have seen or been around anyone that could take the terminology of musicians—you’d tell him what you wanted, how it should sound, how it should feel—and give it enough time, he could make it do that. I provided an honest set of ears and a fair sensitivity that he depended on a great deal. We had a good working relationship as a result of that.', 'I confronted him one day on the fact that I was spending six to eight hours a day at the shop, not only doing these experiments, but sweeping the floor, emptying the trash cans, watching for the fire marshal, because we were doing some real illegal things in those days—and I was still paying 18 bucks a month for my amp and guitar. I said something’s not right about all this, this has been going on over a year now [laughs]. He went over to the file cabinet and got out my tablet sheet contract and tore it up. And from then on, I had anything I needed to play for free. He was a very generous man in some instances.', 'Tell me some more about the Fender company back in the early ‘50s. Were many people working there? Were many guitars being produced?', 'By 1952, the way I remember it is that Fender was producing probably 15 percent of its total output in Telecasters and a few Esquires. Still the most profitable was the little lap steel guitars, some other models of steel guitars, and amplifiers. What cash he had coming in was through those items. Leo had a ’46 Ford and a two-wheel trailer that hauled the products at the end of the day’s work, and sometimes we’d store them overnight and get them out the next morning over to what was called Fender Sales [formed early in ’53]. That was in a nearby town called Santa Ana, and that was Don Randall’s operation. Don was the guy who ran everything in the way of warehouse and sales administration.', 'The company would bounce paychecks occasionally on the workers there, ‘specially if Esther—she was Leo’s first wife, worked for the phone company—was late in depositing her payroll check. Sometimes Fender’s checks would bounce. It was pretty close! Her check would usually cover a couple of girls, a couple of assemblers. I remember there were a lot of times it was pretty difficult to cash Fender checks in Fullerton [laughs].', 'One of the unsung heroes of that era was a very dedicated and talented man named George Fullerton. He and his father Fred both worked early on with Fender, and you’re probably aware that he had substantial input to several things in the early days. He was a lifetime friend and later on a business partner of Leo, and George’s designs and patents are little known, as he is a very reticent person and he considers it self-serving to talk about his own accomplishments—and there were a lot of them.', 'If I could fault Leo, it would probably be in not recognizing and applauding the ideas of others, like George Fullerton is an example. And there were many, including myself, that contributed to the overall success of the Fender company. For some strange reason—and I hope you can get this exactly as I’m saying it, I’ve given it a lot of thought over the years and I’ve watched the man and admired him a lot—for some strange reason he wanted total recognition for everything that was designed at Fender. And yet he never used this to further his own goals. I never understood that side of him at all.', 'How were you getting on with that first Fender guitar of yours?', 'By now I was pretty embodied with the Fender company, and I was having trouble with the Fender Telecaster, because I’m playing several hours each weekend on record sessions and in clubs, and the intonation for recording is a real problem. This was because of the two strings going over a common bridge. You just cannot intonate it—you couldn’t then and you can’t now.', 'So, I sawed mine in two and made me six bridges, and pretty clumsily propped up each half section with a striker strip section from book-matches—they had that little sandpaper grit that helped to hold it in place. So I could intonate the instrument, play in tune. A lot of the recordings that were done in those days were often with big-band arrangements where the guitar player would probably be playing a part with a reed or brass section, and if you couldn’t play in tune the producer wouldn’t call you back for other record dates. So you’d lose money if you couldn’t do that.', 'I started on Leo again to make me a guitar, which is why I went to see him in the first place. Also, steel guitar sounds were needed on sessions in those days, they were quite popular, and if you had a guitar that had a vibrato on it and you used that vibrato in conjunction with a tone–volume pedal, you could play steel guitar glisses and the like. And sometimes you’d get more sessions and more work that way. So the need of the vibrato was born. There were a couple of vibratos on the market at that time, but they wouldn’t come back to pitch.', 'Also, long hours of sitting on a stool in clubs and at studios with a Fender Telecaster digging into my ribcage meant I stayed sore all the time from that square edge that it had [laughs]. Plus the squared-off lower bout never really felt comfortable to my forearm, so that needed to be relieved.', 'As I mentioned, there were a couple of vibrato units on the market. They would do vibrato, but they would come back either sharp or flat, for some of the strings within the chord structure. So I kept on at Leo until he finally consented to build what I wanted, but he also said it couldn’t interfere too much with other development. And as near as I remember it, that was in late 1952.', 'Presumably you weren’t the only musician asking Fender for these sorts of things?', 'Well, what I wanted was a guitar with six bridges that would adjust vertically and horizontally, four pickups, body “relief” or contours, a Bigsby-style headstock, and a vibrato that would not only come back to exact string pitch after you’d sharped or flatted it, but also I wanted it to sharp or flat half a tone at least and hold the chord. And that was tough to do, according to Leo.', 'We modified the Bigsby headstock. It was too ornate and too hard to make, and it wound up then much like you’ve seen it for the last several years. The four pickups became overkill and took too much space, so we dropped that to three, and Leo built a set of six string pawls—that’s what he called them. They looked like different-sized question marks, and it had a common shaft that ran through these six that was attached to the vibrato mechanism. It allowed a chord to stay in tune for a half stop either flat or sharp when the vibrato was used, but we sacrificed the six adjustable bridges in order to do that.', 'So I chose the bridge option as opposed to this other thing. And he later on said we could do both, but that it would cost too much money, that we didn’t have enough money to do it in those days.', 'Did you see the body styles in development?', 'Yes, I came to work at the shop one morning and Leo and George Fullerton had roughed up four bodies with different contours and body reliefs on each one. I picked out one that was closer to my idea, and then a few days later Leo had a very ugly but very playable guitar.', 'It was at this point that the extremely talented musician and engineer Freddie Tavares came to work part-time for Leo. Freddie was one of the best musicians I have ever known, and just as good at engineering. His first love was music generally and steel guitar particularly, and he spent a lot of time in both recording and film studios. It was my good fortune to spend many years with him on the bandstand, in studios, at Fender, wherever. He was a very talented man.', 'So, the Carson’s guitar, as it was known, moved much faster after Freddie got there. Carson’s guitar had got a pretty much backseat treatment up until then, but the instrument played and sounded great—and wouldn’t balance at all, because it was just too heavy on one end, and especially if the player was standing.', 'A big part with me was that the guitar should fit like a good shirt and stay balanced at all times. I said that so many times that Freddie and Leo both got pretty tired of hearing it. But finally they glued a horn on the upper bout, and it was pretty close to balancing. They extended it one more time, and it did balance, but it was really ugly by the standards of the day. Then Freddie Tavares said it wouldn’t be quite so ugly if we put a small horn on the lower side and gave it a little symmetry there, so we did that.', 'I’ve always thought the design of the jack on the Strat is a great combination of function and style.', 'Yes, and it was George Fullerton who said well, we’ve wrecked so many Telecaster jacks by guys stepping on the cord, why don’t we put a front-mounted jack on it, so that if you step on the cord it won’t wreck that input jack? So the front-mounted input jack was George’s idea, and a good one. Pickup design was a matter of trial and error with magnet and wire size and amount of turns on the coil, and since Freddie was a good player and we both needed the same thing, it didn’t take he and I long to decide really what was needed in the way of the pickup sound.', 'So Carson’s breadboard, as some called it for a few weeks, came out to be a pretty usable instrument on the bandstand. It was still in a very raw form when I was using it in the clubs, and I would use sandpaper to sand down the contours sometimes during the job on the bandstand. A bandleader I worked for named Wade Ray almost fired me one time for sanding that guitar on the job [laughs].', 'Your guitar must have been quite a sight [laughs].', 'It had no finish on the body, no plated parts because they were all handmade from raw materials, raw metal, brass, and hot-rolled steel. I was sanding the maple neck, and it was ugly, but this guitar played in tune and performed like nothing else that was available. Other guys that were on the West Coast that were in the recording and the playing business would borrow my guitar, and they wouldn’t return it. I’d have to get out and chase them down [laughs], because they just never had anything like that. I’d tell them go see Leo Fender in Fullerton and get one of their own. And this happened enough times that Leo and Don Randall decided to soft-tool to make a few to test the market and see what would happen.', 'Leo and two tool-and-die makers named Lymon Race and Karl Olmsted—who grew their business along with Fender from the very start—these three guys borrowed $5,000 from the bank in Fullerton. It took three signatures in those days to borrow so much money. This was enough to make the soft-tooling for the market test. I didn’t care one way or another, really, as I had what I wanted, I had a good playable guitar that was doing me well for session and club work.', 'It sounds like it was more or less ready to become the guitar we know as the Fender Stratocaster. How did it finally get there?', 'I think it was Don Randall that probably named it the Stratocaster for the commercial market, because the Telecaster was beginning to get a pretty big play around about then. In those years, the space things were beginning to happen and Stratocaster seemed to be a real racy terminology that players liked. Not everyone took to it right away, though. Some of the other players, especially the big-box jazz players of that time, they were pretty snide about what they called the “electric pork chop,” or the “boat paddle with strings.” But these guys were purists, and for the most part they played big Gibson and Epiphone guitars. And it wasn’t very long before these same guys were after a Telecaster or Strat to get the sound that was rapidly becoming extremely popular.', 'Tell me about Fender’s custom colors. Did you see those on offer at that time?', 'As nearly as I can remember, George Fullerton suggested this—in fact he went to a local paint store to do the first custom colors to be put into production. I was working for Fender on a full-time basis and was involved in that to some degree, however it was not my idea, because some of the colors that he picked I thought were very feminine. I did not think that we would ever sell any of them, especially like fiesta red and ocean turquoise and some of those sissy-looking things—and they went on to do very well [laughs]. I didn’t think much of them.', 'I had painted for myself some years earlier a Strat in a color called Cimarron red. That was a color that a steel guitar player named Leon McAuliffe had sent us to paint one of his steel guitars. [McAuliffe owned the Cimarron Ballroom in Tulsa.] There was some left over, and I had a body painted that color. I think that was about 1955. As a side note, Tony, there is a Custom Shop 100-piece order being done now [Fender’s Bill Carson Stratocaster of 1992–93] in Cimarron red that will be a Carson commemorative signature model.', 'Do you still own the Strat prototype you played?', 'The original prototype of the Strat was stolen from Fender along with several other early models that were being stored with the expectation of some day having a Fender museum. We always suspected employee theft, but only one of the items has surfaced in the collection that was stolen that I know of. And I get calls from people now and then who think they have discovered my old prototype, but so far nothing. There are certain characteristics and marks on the guitar, some of them inside, some of them stamped in the metal, that only I know about, so it would make it easy to identify if it ever does surface.', 'Did you play Fender guitars other than the Strat?', 'Well, I’d played that transitional Tele I told you about. You probably know the history of the Broadcaster name belonging to Gretsch and that we had to change it, and so we had a transitional Tele that only had Fender on the headstock. And I played a Broadcaster, a Jazzmaster, a Jaguar, but I always returned to the Strat. Usually, I’d play these other models as they came out, play them for a short time, and if they had a use on the bandstand for a few tunes I’d carry the extra guitar. But usually I’d return to the Strat and let it do everything. It seemed to be pretty capable.', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

During its heyday in the 1960s, the Detroit company—founded by Berry Gordy in 1959 as Tamla Records—cranked out hit after hit, all with the cohesive, instantly identifiable Motown Sound.', 'The inspiration for Motown\'s "hit factory" ethos came from Gordy\'s time working at the Detroit Lincoln-Mercury plant. "Every day I watched how a bare metal frame, rolling down the line, would come off the other end a spanking brand new car. What a great idea," Gordy said. "Maybe, I could do the same thing with my music."', 'Although Motown would eventually grow into a coast-to-coast empire, it all started in a single house on West Grand Boulevard in Detroit. After moving his family into the second-floor apartment, Gordy converted the rest of the place into Motown\'s headquarters and recording studio, which he christened "Hitsville U.S.A." Every part of making a record was handled in-house, literally—songwriting, arranging, recording, mastering, publishing, and artist relations were all done under one roof.', "Gordy's unique approach to making records is what made Motown a commercial success, but what exactly makes the music so infectious—and what makes these classic records instantly recognizable as Motown?", 'We studied the gear, the players, and the recording techniques, then put a team of artists together to see if we could recreate the signature sound. Watch our video above to see how close we could get. Below, you can hear our covers of "My Girl" and "Ain\'t No Mountain High Enough" in both mono and stereo. Keep reading to learn more about the recording processes at Motown.', 'Motown is known for launching the careers of legendary artists like Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye, and Michael Jackson, many of whom were discovered by Gordy or his producers and molded into stars. Smokey Robinson, Gordy\'s right-hand man, would become a star with The Miracles and in his own right, in addition to producing and writing records for many Motown artists—including "My Girl" for The Temptations.', 'There was plenty of talent behind the scenes at Motown as well. The company employed expert songwriters and arrangers, such as the famed songwriting team of Holland-Dozier-Holland, who penned hits like "Stop! In the Name of Love" by The Supremes, "Nowhere to Run" by Martha & The Vandellas, and "It\'s the Same Old Song" by The Four Tops, among many others.', "But most importantly, behind every hook, ballad, and anthem that came out of Motown was a world-class backing band called The Funk Brothers. Although they're often compared to Booker T. and the MGs, the house band at Stax Records in Memphis, the Funk Brothers weren't actually a performing group—more like a loose collective of session players and touring musicians who cut their teeth in Detroit's club scene. Although only 13 members are officially recognized by The Recording Academy, any session musician who played on a Motown record was considered a Funk Brother.", 'Each musician contributed their own signature sound to every session; a unique product of their tastes, playing styles, and instruments. Often left to fill in the blanks of song arrangements themselves, their individual styles all contributed collectively to the Motown Sound.', 'Motown had many drummers on call, all of them ace players who lent their own subtle inflections to any given session. For instance, Benny Benjamin tended to kick off songs or fills with a quick pick-up hit before the beat, as heard on songs like The Temptations\' "Get Ready." Other Motown drummers eventually began to adopt this move, cementing it as part of the Motown Sound.', 'Many Motown tunes emphasize beats two and four heavily. The backbeat was usually reinforced by a rhythm guitar and more percussion, such as Jack Ashford\'s tambourine (a 12" Ludwig single-row). Between hits on the two and four, Ashford would add in intricate patterns to spice up the rhythm.', 'Another key piece of the Motown rhythm section\'s sonic signature was the house kit at Hitsville, a piecemeal set of Rogers, Ludwig, and other classic brands that got used on almost every session after 1963. "They were good drums, but they were second-hand," Uriel Jones told Modern Drummer in 1999. "They also had another set of drums down there that they bought a few years later, but those drums were only used when we had a double drummer session. That second set was also just thrown-together stuff."', "The bass drum was often recorded with the front head removed and blankets stuffed inside the shell to reduce resonance. For a crisp snare sound, strips of electrical tape were placed on each side of the strainer to keep the snares as close to the head as possible, and the drum was mic'd either right up close on the top head or near the vent on the side.", "For mics, Motown's engineers used a minimal setup, including a single Neumann U 67 as an overhead and a RCA 77 placed a few feet back from the front of the bass drum. In our video above, we're using a AKG C12VR for the overhead, a Neumann KM84 on the snare, and a RCA 77-DX for the kick.", 'This free collection of drum loops and one-shots recreates the famous Motown drum sounds, inspired by drummers Benny Benjamin, Uriel Jones, Richard "Pistol" Allen, and more, as well as Jack Ashford’s energetic tambourine style.', "The piano often dictated the harmonic structure of many Motown songs, and the Funk Brothers' bandleader usually led the group from behind the keys. The first bandleader was Joe Hunter, who was succeeded by Earl Van Dyke in 1964. While Hunter played in a bluesy, almost boogie-woogie style, Van Dyke was more aggressive, especially with the bass notes on his left hand. It was also common to have two pianos doubling a part, be it acoustic, electric, or both.", "An 1877 Steinway was the go-to piano at Hitsville. In our attempt at recreating this sound, we mic'd a 1970s Baldwin with a Neumann KM 86 just above where the piano's low and high strings meet. As Rax Trax's Noam Wallenberg explains above, we chose the KM86 because it was a favorite microphone at Motown during the studio's later years.", "Perhaps the most well-known Funk Brother, James Jamerson contributed uniquely melodic basslines that stood out from some of the more basic pop fare at the time (and today). When he switched from upright to electric to do pop sessions, Jamerson kept the action extra-high on his '62 Fender 'Funk Machine' Precision Bass and stuck with an aggressive one-finger technique he had developed. He also kept his strings muted at the bridge, giving him a unique, mellow-yet-percussive sound.", "Jamerson would often add in quick flourishes, pick-up notes, and other embellishments by raking his finger quickly across the strings. The way he would attack each note and dart in and out of phrases had a profound effect on the rollicking feel of the Motown rhythm. In the mid-'60s, the bass would be recorded direct through the Motown DI (which you can learn more about below).", 'Many Motown sessions had multiple guitarists, often three, playing at once. Eddie "Chank" Willis typically held down the rhythm by "chanking" on the two and four with a trebly Gibson Firebird. Others, such as Robert White and Joe Messina, would follow the piano melody or add their own lead lines. The guitars in the mid-\'60s period were often recorded direct.', 'Dennis Coffey joined the Funk Brothers in the late \'60s. In contrast to the guitar tracks of earlier years, Coffey used effects like distortion, wah-wah, and tape delay to bring a heavier, more experimental sound to tracks like "Cloud Nine" and "Ball of Confusion" by the Temptations.', "As recording studios go, Hitsville's Studio A was a kind of a paradox. Located in the basement of a humble Midwestern house, it was very much the opposite of the acoustically optimized, purpose-built facilities in Hollywood—yet it was just as well-equipped as its competition and dialed-in to get a particular sound that had no equal.", 'For starters, Studio A\'s live room was just a simple rectangle with ceilings only slightly taller than average—not exactly a cavernous space like Abbey Road\'s famous Studio 2. The Steinway grand piano dominated the space, leaving relatively little room once mics, chairs, and music stands were set up, and numerous cables dangling from the ceiling earned this space the nickname "The Snake Pit." The adjoining control room was even less ideal: The cramped, boxy space was cluttered with gear and lacked the fine-tuned acoustic treatment of a professional studio—which just goes to show how much more the talent mattered than the acoustics.', "But despite their relatively modest facility, Motown kept up with the cutting edge of recording technology. Starting off with a primitive two-track setup, Hitsville graduated to a three-track format in 1961 before moving to eight-track in the mid-'60s and 16-track by the end of the decade.", 'The move to higher track counts did a lot to shape the Motown Sound, and the difference can be heard clearly by comparing an early song like "Heat Wave" by Martha & The Vandellas with a later cut like "Cloud Nine" by the Temptations. Track limitations on the former required the tambourine, snare, and hi-hat all to share a single mic, while the latter features dedicated tracks for auxiliary percussion, multiple guitars, and backup vocals.', "However, sometimes even the latest and greatest gear (including legendary vintage brands like Pultec, Langevin, Fairchild, and Urei) wasn't enough. When Motown's engineers saw a way to improve on a design (or needed a tool that simply didn't exist yet), Motown's head of engineering, Mike McLean, would hit the soldering bench to whip up a custom solution.", "McLean's creations include the almost-mythical Motown EQ (essentially a souped-up Langevin), as well as the legendary Motown DI direct box, an innovation which allowed them to plug electric guitars and basses directly into the console to capture the live band without bleed between instruments. A recreated version of the Motown DI is now publicly available as the Acme Audio Motown DI WB-3.", 'But for all their cutting-edge gadgets, one of the most iconic elements of the Motown Sound comes from a decidedly low-tech effect: the echo chamber. A speaker and a microphone sat permanently wired up in the attic of Hitsville, which had been drywalled and coated with shellac but otherwise untreated. During mixing, engineers would pipe certain tracks through the speaker, record the reverberation with the microphone, and blend it into the mix to add a sense of space. This effect is clearly audible on the foot-stomps at the beginning of The Supremes\' "Where Did Our Love Go."', "In addition to the echo chamber, Motown also had an EMT 140 plate reverb and an Echoplex tape delay unit they'd use from time to time. In our attempt at recreating the Motown Sound, we used the Audio Ease Altiverb reverb plugin, Universal Audio's digital emulation of the EMT 140, and a Fulltone Tube Tape Echo.", "Although much of Motown's top-of-the-line equipment was engineered to sound as transparent as possible, all the circuitry, tubes, and tape in the signal chain inevitably introduced countless subtle distortions. In fact, part of Motown's highly coveted vintage sound is the result of the engineers knowing their equipment intimately and getting the best sound possible out of it, using its tonal coloration to their advantage wherever possible.", "Having some of the finest gear in the world certainly gave Motown an edge, but having a wizard at the controls is what really gave them a sound. Although plenty of skilled people (including Berry Gordy himself) sat behind the board at Motown over the years, the longest-tenured wizard was a man named Russ Terrana. The 23-year-old was hired on the spot after his interview in 1966, quickly sharpening his engineering chops and gaining Gordy's trust. Terrana stayed on for 18 years, eventually becoming chief engineer and heading up the company's LA studio.", '"Every song, to me, was like a person," Terrana said in a 2015 interview with Tape Op. "It had its own personality, and there were no two songs alike. I never approached the song with the same thing I did to another song. I would look at the song as an individual. \'Now what am I going to do with this guy? What are the guitars doing in the verse, compared to what they\'re doing in the chorus? Do I want to use more piano in the chorus, because the keyboard player is doing something stronger in the chorus?\' And I\'d feature the keyboard player more during the chorus."', 'Although experimentation was encouraged, one thing was fairly consistent in the studio at Motown: Tracks were typically recorded dry, with additional processing added only in the mixing stage.', '"We never recorded with any special reverb, delays, or anything," said Terrana. "We never processed anything to the point of, \'That\'s the way it\'s going to be.\'" One notable exception to this rule are Coffey\'s guitar pedals, including the Echoplex tape delay and Vox Tonebender fuzz, which he put to great use in Motown\'s late-\'60s era of psychedelic soul.', "The expert engineering at Motown extended all the way to the cutting of the master discs. Starting in 1965, Motown employed the legendary Bob Olhsson as their in-house mastering engineer. Working out of a separate mixing and mastering room, Olhsson cut acetates of countless mixes using state-of-the-art Neumann lathes. But mastering wasn't what it is today. Instead of piling on processing to make the mixes sound warmer or richer, all Olhsson had to do was sequence the songs on tape and get a clean transfer with a touch of EQ or limiting where necessary (an art in itself).", '"They were very, very concerned that things not be particularly modified in the transfer," Olhsson told Tape Op in 2002. "They\'d rather do a new mix than try and fix anything in mastering. So I started out pretty much doing really hot flat transfers, although if we heard something that seemed obvious to change, we could throw on some EQ and send an alternative version labeled with what we did."', 'Motown officially picked up and moved their entire operation to Los Angeles in 1972, signaling the end of the classic era of Motown. Although the magic of Hitsville was no longer part of the equation, Motown continued to pump out hits (and still do to this day). In fact, 98 Degrees, Erykah Badu, and even Bruce Willis have all recorded for Motown—but obviously, none of their records quite captured the Motown Sound.', "If you're looking to bring a little taste of Motown to your next project, check out our Studio Sampled Drums: Hitsville, U.S.A. sample pack for some classic beats and one-shots recorded in the style of Motown.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

producer looking to sample a fragment of a song or a vocal phrase. You'd be in a pretty tough spot, as affordable options are few and far between.", "If you're an innovator like The 45 King or Afrika Islam, you can loop and extend samples with your cassette deck using the pause tape method. Wealthy individuals with an extra 13,000 British Pounds (roughly $79,000 in modern US dollars) laying around or access to an expensive studio might utilize a Fairlight CMI, but a happy medium between DIY tape-deck minimalism and outrageously expensive gear doesn't exist yet.", 'In spite of samplers costing the equivalent of an impressive annual salary, sampling technology advanced rapidly after the advent of the Fairlight CMI in 1979. By 1981, Toshiba introduced the first digital sampler with the LMD-649, another important step in making the art of sampling accessible to the masses.', "Yet for all the sampling innovation happening at various companies, taking a sample and mapping it across your keyboard—a standard move in any DAW today—was an impossible dream to most, as E-mu's 1981 Emulator keyboard carried a hefty $8,000 price tag, equivalent to roughly $22,000 modern US dollars. This barrier to entry likely discouraged many a potential producer, until a new invention by a trio of computer builders made a relatively affordable keyboard sampler a reality.", 'In 1982, Bruce Crockett, Al Charpentier, and Bob Yannes founded Ensoniq after leaving Commodore Business Machines, where they had helped kickstart the home computer revolution and became renowned VLSI (very large scale integration) experts. Taking note of the incredibly steep pricing model for samplers on the market at the time of their departure, the men saw an opportunity to introduce quality instruments to consumers at a higher volume and a lower price tag.', 'The move away from Commodore came with significant financial risks for all involved, as each literally bet the house on their new endeavor. "We financed our houses, our cars, everything," Crockett told National Book Award-winner James McBride in a January 1988 Washington Post article.', 'Add to that $1,000,000 in payments from a lucrative consulting gig, $350,000 in venture capitalist funding, and a $100,000 loan from a willing bank, and the Ensoniq team had enough money in its coffers to launch.', 'As the trio navigated the uncertainty of their new business venture, their collective expertise helped them design the sleek, user-friendly Mirage sampling keyboard—the first piece of gear that officially put Ensoniq on the map. Released in 1984 with a price tag of $1,695 (about $4,000 in modern currency), the machine wowed the industry. Billboard magazine credited the company with bringing "sampling capability down to the unheard-of price point of less than $1,700."', "Charpentier and Yannes deserve credit for dropping the price of samplers so significantly, as they designed a microchip to replace a total of 120 costly chips used in the much pricier keyboards of their competitors. In spite of their revolutionary microchip innovation, Mirage's 8-bit quality and limited sampling time likely seems paltry by current producers' standards. Regardless, it wasn't long before the keyboard started making its way onto hit records.", 'Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis were early adopters, as they fired up the Mirage for Janet Jackson\'s "When I Think Of You" from her commercial and critical triumph Control in 1986. The legendary production duo also put the sampler to use alongside an E-mu SP-1200 on "Escapade," "Miss You Much," and "Love Will Never Do (Without You)" from 1989\'s Rhythm Nation 1814, according to this interview with Jimmy Jam for Red Bull Music Academy.', 'Likewise, sampling icons and Public Enemy\'s long-time production team The Bomb Squad made good use of the keyboard. According to Hank Shocklee in another RBMA interview, he constructed the original instrumental for "Rebel Without A Pause" from It Takes A Nation of Millions To Hold Us Back with the Mirage.', 'When the group experimented with resampling some of "Rebel" in the studio\'s superior Akai S-900, Shocklee immediately felt his original production lost a subtle but essential edge when the interesting imperfections of the Mirage version were smoothed over.', '"There was a feel and sound that the Mirage had at four bits and there was something good about the fact that it could only give you three seconds, because the way that it caught with a little hiccup in it that gave you that extra charge," Shocklee told Philip Stevenson in a 2006 Tape Op interview. [Ed.: Factory specs list the Mirage sampling rate at 8-bit instead of 4-bit.]', 'Before all was said and done, the roster of esteemed Mirage users expanded to include Prince and Herbie Hancock. In fact, Hancock demonstrated the keyboard before it hit the commercial market in a special episode of The Muppet Show filmed in Africa—an experience he details in his book Herbie Hancock: Possibilities.', 'Ensoniq\'s 1988 release of the EPS sampling keyboard proved another important stepping stone for the company and the art of sampling. "The EPS is a quantum improvement in sampling technology for Ensoniq and, in many ways, for sampling in general," Craig Anderton wrote in Sound on Sound in a February 1988 review. "I have a feeling this is the instrument that will break the sampling market wide open."', "The EPS' 13-bit sampling rate certainly was an upgrade in quality from what The Bomb Squad employed on their early Public Enemy classic, but Ensoniq samplers truly became a staple in rap records when the company introduced the EPS 16+ and its 16-bit capability in 1990.", 'With some notable upgrades in sound quality and performance over the original EPS, the 16+ proved the perfect instrument for Arrested Development frontman Speech to create the group\'s breakthrough single "Tennessee." Created in the aftermath of his grandmother\'s passing and his brother\'s unexpected death one week later, Speech likened the song\'s chorus to "a prayer to God" in a February 2008 Songfacts interview with Carl Wiser.', 'The experience of creating "Tennessee" was so emotional that Speech needed to construct the beat before he could write a single line. Using an EPS 16+ in tandem with Alesis HR-16 drum machine, he decided to sample Prince saying the word "Tennessee" from his 1988 "Alphabet St." single and make it a central part of the song. After taking the tiny snippet of sound, Speech experimented with replaying it at varying pitches on the EPS 16+ in the song\'s opening and throughout.', 'The interesting vocal sample—coupled with a powerful drum track, introspective lyrics from Speech, and some beautiful singing from Dionne Farris—helped "Tennessee" hit the top of the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart while Arrested Development\'s debut, 3 Years, 5 Months and 2 Days In The Life Of…, sold an excess of four million copies in the ensuing years.', 'Around the same time Speech was piecing together drum hits and pitched-down Prince vocals, another soon-to-be breakthrough artist was familiarizing himself with the EPS—850 miles northeast of Atlanta—in Staten Island.', 'Despite making some early classics like Method Man\'s "Bring The Pain" with an E-mu SP-1200, Wu-Tang frontman RZA\'s life as an artist was forever changed when friend and collaborator RNS traded him the Ensoniq EPS for his 1200 in the early \'90s. Never completely satisfied with the 1200 interface, the layout of the EPS allowed RZA to experiment with looping two and four bars in a style that was largely unprecedented at the time. "I fell in love with the EPS. I didn\'t care about the SP-1200 no more," he told Kotori Magazine in a November 2007 video interview.', 'With time, RZA graduated to the 16+ model, producing the mayhem-inciting \'90s classic "Wu-Tang Clan Ain\'t Nuthin\' ta F\' Wit" by using the machine. "All of it was done with stolen electricity, on a little eight track, an Emulator X SP-1200 sampler, and an Ensoniq EPS 16+ sampling keyboard that I got from hustling," he wrote in his book The Tao of Wu. "It was the true hip-hop means of production." [Ed.: The mention of the E-mu Emulator X is likely an error, as it wasn\'t available until 2004.]', "Insepctah Deck will never forgot witnessing the song's inception, though there is a slight discrepancy in memory—he remembered RZA making the beat with the ASR-10, an EPS 16+ upgrade Ensoniq released in 1992. Just as Speech used his Ensoniq sampler to make significant changes in the pitch of his samples, Deck recalled RZA flexing on the keyboard in much the same way—picking apart sounds, adjusting their tempos, and turning them into something completely original.", '"There\'s a moaning noise in there and he slowed it down dramatically, took two pieces, and put them together," Deck told author Brian Coleman in his book Check the Technique: Liner Notes for Hip-Hop Junkies. "To watch him doing that was just incredible."', 'Whether it was an EPS 16+ or an ASR-10, an interview with RZA indicates that he used the ASR to compose most of Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), a game-changing album that was sonically and lyrically unlike anything else in the industry at the time of its release in 1993. Over 25 years old, 36 Chambers continues to influence MCs and producers from all over the world. According to RZA, the ASR-10 helped him reach an elite level and shaped many other early Wu group and solo classics. "That\'s when I became a master producer," he told Kotori. "The whole first 100 Wu-Tang songs was made on an ASR-10."', 'The ASR-10 also gave him the ability to cook up "Graveyard Chamber" for The Gravediggaz nightmarish masterpiece 6 Feet Deep just one year after the release of 36 Chambers. Prince Paul, who handled the lion\'s share of production and also masterminded the entire concept album, later said that watching RZA flex his deft touch on the keyboard was a transformative experience. "He just did his stuff unorthodox, he just put stuff in off-beat, put in snares manually," Paul told Chris Pattinson in a 2013 HipHopSite interview. "Technically what he was doing was off, but it felt right and sounded right."', 'Paul would carry those ASR-10 lessons with him when he edited together his brilliant 1999 concept record A Prince Among Thieves line by line with the ASR-10 doing much of the heavy lifting—one of the more impressive feats ever achieved with an Ensoniq instrument. "I did it on an ASR-10, no Pro Tools," he told The Cipher podcast in a 2015 interview. "ASR and ADATs. And a sequence program on Mac called Master Tracks Pro."', 'Even when the process wasn\'t as complicated as the making of A Prince Among Thieves, the ASR-10 helped producers achieve their desired sound in any given circumstance. Veteran super-producer Alchemist found this out when late MC Prodigy called him to the studio in the middle of the night while working on Mobb Deep\'s 1999 release Murda Muzik. "I literally threw my ASR in the fucking case and got a cab and went to the studio and when I got there, G Rap was sitting there," Alchemist told Insanul Ahmed in a 2012 Complex interview.', 'Laying down a two bar loop with no added drums straight out of his ASR, Alchemist\'s "The Realest" instrumental so inspired G Rap that the veteran rap legend penned a classic verse in a mere 45 minutes. "The Realest" was the highlight of Murda Muzik and proved to be a key production in Alchemist\'s career, helping to make him a household name in the years to come.', 'A few years prior to the release of A Prince Among Thieves, Norfolk, Virginia native Timbaland established himself as a serious force in the industry with his work on Missy Elliott\'s 1996 Supa Dupa Fly, an incredibly innovative album he produced from beginning to end. Though Timbaland has been notoriously tight-lipped about his production process throughout his time in the industry, he does discuss the importance of the ASR to his career in his memoir The Emperor of Sound. A 2007 Entertainment Weekly article by Ethan Brown further indicates that the ASR was his weapon of choice throughout the first decade of his career. "Tims made all of his hits on this early \'90s-era keyboard, from Ginuwine\'s \'Pony\' to Timberlake\'s \'What Goes Around Comes Around,\'" Brown wrote. "He has an almost romantic relationship with his ASR-10."', "For much of the late '90s and the first decade of the 2000s, fellow Virginia natives and ASR-10 devotees The Neptunes, a production duo comprised of Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo, would dominate the charts and airwaves alongside Timbaland. Though The Neptunes employed various tools of the trade during their unstoppable multi-year reign, the ASR remained an intuitive and familiar part of their setup that they went to often for drum sounds, as described in this 2017 Electronic Musician interview.", 'By the time Timbaland and The Neptunes were well-asserted in their dominance, a young Chicago producer would take ASR success to another level by putting a new spin on old techniques. Using the Ensoniq pitching feature like his producer forefathers, Kanye West established a sound in the early 2000s that would define the early part of his career as a key producer for Jay-Z and many other Roc-A-Fella artists. He continued to drastically pitch up samples on his seminal The College Dropout debut, selling millions of records and making himself a superstar in the process.', 'In a 2004 Electronic Musician interview, West explained how he transformed songs like Chaka Khan\'s "Through The Fire" into "Through The Wire," the first single of his solo career. "I sample them at regular speed, then speed them up inside the ASR-10," he told journalist Ken Micallef. "The ASR-10 is like my left hand. I can chop samples into 61 pieces without wasting any memory."', 'Even though Kanye has used various other instruments to make music over the years, he continued putting the ASR-10 to use on cuts like 2007\'s "Stronger," which saw him sampling Daft Punk with the vintage Ensoniq machine.', "By 1998, Ensoniq says it owned 75% of the sampling keyboard market. But despite that market-share and having such an esteemed, musically diverse, and high-profile clientele, Ensoniq faltered as the '90s came to a close. Clunky attempts to compete with Akai's MPC in the form of the ASR-X and ASR-X Pro did not perform well, and the company released their final piece of gear—the Halo—in 2002, after merging with E-mu.", 'And even though the EPS 16+ and ASR-10 are beloved by sampling enthusiasts, they are not without serious problems. Mention the words "Error 144 Reboot" to anyone who has used the keyboards and they\'re likely to shudder with dread at the memory of an incredible piece of production they lost because of a system crash. As a result of both keyboards\' sometimes faulty circuitry, many beatmakers ditched the 16+ and ASR-10, moving on to new and improved samplers over time.', 'Though many high-profile ASR users like Alchemist, Babu, !llmind, DJ Khalil, Khyrsis, and Nottz have more or less moved on to more modern means of production, Seattle\'s Jake One continues to make his ASR work well for him by playing out his beats into Pro Tools—a studio rig he has employed for many years. With this setup he deftly chopped up samples for Chance The Rapper\'s early hit Acid Rap; Dr. Dre, Rick Ross, and Jay-Z\'s gospel-infused single "3 Kings," and De La Soul and MF Doom\'s hard-hitting mid-2000s masterpiece "Rock Co.Kane Flow."', "Beyond just running an ASR through Pro Tools, producers are finding other ways to keep the now 27-year-old sampler alive and well. Sampling live instruments through the keyboard is one such technique, a practice that dates back to Babu and Evidence sampling shakers and tambourines into the ASR for Dilated People's 2006 album 20/20 and before.", 'Wu affiliate and producer Mathematics used live instrumentation to craft all of the beats on Wu-Tang\'s 2017 album The Saga Continues, giving the album a mellow, dark sound somewhat reminiscent of early Wu productions RZA used to crank out on his Ensoniq keyboards. "Instead of just sampling and make music in there, I took the instruments I played and run them through the ASR-10," Mathematics said in a 2018 abcdrduson interview. "I tried to find the perfect cohesion of everything."', 'The rise in popularity of both producer drum kits and beat tapes on Bandcamp, SoundCloud, and streaming platforms is also providing new opportunities for producers to resurrect their old ASR productions from the past. Beat Fanatic co-founder SlopFunkDust, who owns over 1,000 floppy discs full of ASR-10 beats, is releasing his creations in a multi-volume series titled ASR-10 - Beat Archive.', 'Meanwhile Alchemist, who was recently spotted in the studio playing beats out of his ASR-10, took drum sounds from his ASR classics like Dilated Peoples\' "Worst Comes To Worst" and compiled them into The Official Alchemist Drum Kit - ALC Secret Sauce.', "Whether meshing Ensoniq samplers with modern DAWs and software, combining them with live instruments, or breathing new life into old ASR creations in the form of beat tapes and drum kits, it seems like producers will keep the company's legacy burning bright for many years to come—even though they went out of business 17 years ago.", 'About the author: Gino Sorcinelli is the writer, creator, and editor of Micro-Chop, a Substack newsletter that dissects beatmaking, DJing, music production, rapping, and sampling.

The tape loops and automatic doubled-tracked vocals of "Tomorrow Never Knows," the reversed swirls heard first on "Rain," the Mellotron-drenched and pitch-shifted "Strawberry Fields Forever," and on and on. Such feats are all the more remarkable—and were, for producer George Martin and engineers like Geoff Emerick and Ken Townshend, all the more challenging—given the limited recording technology they pushed and overcame to capture the sonic experiments.', "Back in the '60s, when Abbey Road Studios was still named EMI Studios, it boasted of its state-of-the-art gear. But the custom-built REDD.51 console The Beatles relied on for every record they made there until 1969's Abbey Road was, by that point, old tech. It had just eight mic inputs, two auxiliary inputs, and four outputs routed to four-track tape machines. The dense pop they created, whether psychedelic or symphonic or some mixture of the two, was a constant battle against the limitations of available equipment.", "Solid State: The Story of Abbey Road and the End of The Beatles is a new book by Beatles historian and George Martin biographer Kenneth Womack that details just how much the studio's technological upgrades—mainly, the creation of the solid-state TG12345 console and use of eight-track tape machines—would change the sound of The Beatles' last group effort.", "With an expanded console, a new-found dedication to stereo mixing, and the band's continued willingness to use new instrumentation, Abbey Road would sound like no other Beatles record before it. Each instrument was more defined, the bass and other low-end was tight and clear, and over everything was a high-end sparkle.", "Below, we're taking a look at the gear behind that sound.", "EMI's TG12345 console was newly installed when The Beatles blocked off recording dates for the whole of July and August 1969 to make Abbey Road.", "The 24-input, 8-output, solid-state deck was a long time coming. While the group had eight-track recorders for the last half of 1968's The Beatles, the separation of signals and channel-specific processing the TG12345 provided opened the door to more modern recording processes.", "To understand just how much of a difference this made, let's look at the limitations of the previous REDD.51 desk. As stated above, it had just eight mic inputs and four outputs, with the associated tape machines being limited to four-track recording. Once The Beatles began, in earnest, their mid-'60s studio experimentation, this resulted in technical drudgery for the engineers. Despite the limited tracks, they had to save space, mix and bounce previously recorded tracks to make room for new parts, or improvise hacks in more creative ways.", "As Geoff Emerick explained previously in our article about the recording of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band:", '', '', 'For a song like Sgt. Pepper\'s "A Day in the Life," John, Paul, George, and Ringo had already maxed out the available four tracks before adding the orchestra. So George Martin and his team combined to two four-track recorders as best they could.', '"Well, we didn\'t have any sync facilities in those days—they just didn\'t exist—so we had to do it purely and simply by guesswork," he told Tony Bacon. "That\'s why you can hear a little bit of bad ensemble… you can hear several versions of the orchestras slightly different from each other."', 'Just over two years later, the introduction of the TG12345 made such a process a thing of the past, at least until future artists began pushing the boundaries of eight tracks.', 'For the thick overdubbed guitars of Abbey Road\'s "I Want You (She\'s So Heavy)," they simply kept adding. "They wanted a massive sound so they kept tracking and tracking, over and over," that session\'s engineer Jeff Jarratt said. Moments like that or the multi-mic\'d drum solo of "The End" could be done with far less pain and hassle.', 'Kenneth Womack writes in Solid State: "There was no denying the technical leap that EMI\'s engineers had achieved with the console, which boasted three times the microphone inputs associated with the REDD.51, as well as built-in limiters/compressors on every channel. Quite suddenly, the possibilities of the recording studio had been expanded considerably."', 'In addition to built-in limiters/compressors, which were modeled off of Fairchild and Altec outboard gear, each channel also had more much useful EQ controls. As this MusicTech article explains, the previous REDD.51 console had just two EQ settings, one labeled "Pop," one "Classic," each with extraordinarily limited control over some cuts, boosts, or shelves.', 'The TG12345, on the other hand, had much better options: treble and bass controls on each individual channel, as well as more EQ available on grouped channels and the main outputs.', 'However, the differences between the tube-based REDD.51 and solid-state TG12345 were more than the sum of their parts. The overall effect of the new board—with its separation, its transistorized components, and its versatility—was to give both a rounder and brighter sound to Abbey Road than previous Beatles recordings had.', 'Engineer Geoff Emerick didn\'t quite know what to make of it at the time. It\'s been well-documented that Emerick was not always the biggest fan of the new sound, saying "Personally, I preferred the punchier sound we had gotten out of the old tube console and four-track recorder. ... It seemed like a step backward." But in Solid State, he explains how that mellowness affected the recordings:', '', '', "While Emerick wasn't pleased by the mellower playback, he did make great use of the new board's increased channels and stereo capabilities.", 'According to Solid State, when mic\'ing the drums for Ringo\'s solo on "The End" (which still had the working title of "Ending" at this point in the process), "Emerick prepared for the July 23rd session for \'Ending\' by placing a dozen microphones around Ringo\'s kit. The engineer also devoted two of the recording\'s eight available tracks—as opposed to a single track, as was their usual practice—in order to afford the solo with even greater prominence. In this way, Starr\'s solo for \'Ending\' was the only time that his drums were recorded in true stereo."', 'In the final mix of the track, you can hear the wide stereo image not only in the drums, but in the panning of the voices during the lines "Everybody\'s laughing / Everybody\'s happy," another benefit of the TG12345\'s superior stereo capabilities.', "As close fans of The Beatles' records will know, the band and producer George Martin had, for most of their careers, preferred the mono mixes of their records. While those stereo mixes of Rubber Soul, Revolver, and Sgt. Pepper may have been how some listeners (particularly those in the US) first experienced them, they were often made as a quick afterthought. The new console's much greater panning controls, and the growing pro-stereo tastes of the public, put stereo sound at the forefront of Abbey Road.", 'As Womack writes, "By 1969, [Martin] was only too happy to follow the marketplace and turn his attentions to stereophonic sound. Besides, he appreciated the sonic possibilities that stereo promised in an age of evolving multitrack recording. And with the benefit of eight-track recording, he possessed the capacity for manipulating a much wider soundscape."', 'Martin himself later said, "One of the fascinating things I used to find was when you panned something from left to right, it didn\'t just go straight across, it goes up in an arc above you. It was like going through a proscenium arch in a theatre. And you could then see—very vividly in your mind—what the sounds were doing as a stereo picture."', '1967\'s "Strawberry Fields Forever" had seen The Beatles using the Mellotron, a tape-based sampler, but the group put its first true synthesizer—a Moog Synthesizer IIIp—to tape on Abbey Road.', 'Before the sessions got underway, Harrison had purchased a modular system from Moog, having been duly impressed by a visit to California and a demonstration at the Monterey Pop Festival.', 'Harrison was still a relative novice by the time the group entered EMI Studios in the summer of \'69, and Lennon and McCartney were experimenting with the Moog for the first time in the studio. Even still, it found its way on to "Maxwell\'s Silver Hammer," "Here Comes the Sun," "Because," and "I Want You (She\'s So Heavy)."', 'The modular array included two keyboards, a ribbon controller, and a large collection of 901-Series oscillators, a 984 Matrix Mixer, and 905 Spring Reverbs. For The Beatles\' first ventures, they kept their synth sounds relatively tame. McCartney used the ribbon controller to play a brassy, melodic lead on "Maxwell\'s Silver Hammer," while Harrison used it to double Martin\'s harpsichord part on "Because."', 'On the coda of "I Want You," as the dense overdubbed guitars already competed for sonic space, Lennon introduced a scrawl of white noise to overtake the song.', 'Womack recounts the scene in Solid State: "Lennon offered careful instructions in order to ratchet up the intensity. \'Louder! Louder!\' he implored Emerick during the mixing process. \'I want the track to build and build and build, and then I want the white noise to completely take over and blot out the music altogether.\' With only 21 seconds remaining of the original recording, \'all of a sudden he barked out an order\' to the Beatles\' engineer, \'Cut the tape here!\'"', "While we looked at some of the most important new gear behind the sound of Abbey Road, you can read far more about the technology, the songwriting, and the group's in-fighting in Womack's brand-new Solid State: The Story of Abbey Road and the End of The Beatles.

It was her third album, titled Control, and the first of what would become a history of famed collaboration between Jackson and legendary producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.", 'Not only was that record significant for its commercial success, but it likewise represented a personal, professional, and musical breakthrough for Jackson. She used her lyrical space largely autobiographically, writing personal songs about her recent annulment and about severing ties from her family and father and former manager, Joseph Jackson. Her honesty was wrapped in Jam\'s and Lewis\'s groundbreaking production style, so inventive that it won them a Producer of the Year Grammy in 1987 and is regarded as one of the earliest originations of a genre of music that would become very popular in the following years called "new jack swing."', 'With this aptly named third release, the world saw Jackson doing just that—taking control—and they wanted more. But Jackson wasn\'t keen simply to make the follow-up that A&M Records was asking her for—the Control: Part Two that everyone thought they wanted, which would have delved more deeply into her family\'s salacious scandals and her own personal life dramas. "That\'s what I didn\'t want to do," Jackson told Jet in \'89. "I wanted to do something that I really believe in and that I really felt strong about."', "Though this thought was certainly top-of-mind when she returned to Jam's and Lewis's Flyte Tyme studio in the winter of '88 to start on her fourth record, it was little more than a thought at that point. The trio didn't yet know that their impending sessions would result in Rhythm Nation 1814—a 12-track (save interludes) concept album dealing with themes like drugs, racism, and poverty, or that it would go on to regularly garner favorable comparisons to Marvin Gaye's 1971 release, What's Going On.", "No, most of that fell into place later. On day one, Jackson's creative output was of a different kind, coming in the form of her first snow angel, made on the ground outside of the Minneapolis-based studio.", '"She told us, \'I\'ve always wanted to do that!\' We were like, \'Get in here. You\'re going to catch a cold. We\'re trying to get started here. You\'re going to mess your voice up!" Jam reminisced, laughing, in a 2014 interview with the Red Bull Music Academy. "It was so funny. I think that snow angel stayed on the ground the entire winter." And while that angel stood guard outside of Flyte Tyme, inside the studio is where the record would take shape over the next six months of sessions.', 'In the three-year gap between Control and Rhythm Nation, Jam and Lewis had further sharpened their technical skills, producing three new records: Keep Your Eye On Me by Herb Alpert, Crash by The Human League, and Heart Break by New Edition. The pair also seriously updated their studio and gear selection.', 'The main event was a brand-new mixing console called the Harrison Series 10, which was the first analog console to feature a digital control surface, with full automation of all parameters. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis were the first studio to have it, according to Jam. This meant that they could cut down the time it took to switch songs to about 10 minutes because complex mixes now required little-to-no cross-patching.', "The console upgrades also doubled the number of tracks they had been previously working with (from 24 to 48), which became especially handy when laying down Jackson's vocal tracks—all of which, lead and backup, she sang herself.", '"The idea with [Jackson] has always been that she does all of her own vocals, so that it’s totally a Janet record. If you think about the way we did the harmonies for this album, I think about the song \'Love Will Never Do (Without You),\' which had some of the most intricate harmonies, particularly at the end of the song, where things are overlapping each other," Jam said.', '"There may be 32 tracks of vocals at that point in the song, where we would take a four-part harmony and we have her do each note four times, which would be 16 takes. If we had to put another part on top of that, we would do the same thing, so then there would be 32 vocal takes, not counting the leads. What we would do is we would do the backgrounds first to get her voice warmed up, so when it came time to do the leads, it was simple, because her voice had warmed up. It takes a lot of discipline and work ethic to do that."', "When it came to recording vocals, their go-to mic at the time was the AKG C 12, unconventionally set in an omni pattern rather than the cardioid pattern most often used for vocal performances. Long-time Flyte Tyme mixing engineer Steve Hodge has explained that this comes down to the sound of the room's he's been fortunate enough to record in—because the rooms have sounded great, he's always wanted to infuse them into the vocals for a bit of extra character.", 'The open pattern also helped Hodge retain the youthful, girlish character of Jackson\'s voice, which he did by attenuating added high-end with an Orban de-esser. "The thing you have to understand with vocals," Hodge said in an interview with Sound On Sound, "is that every time you add something to the signal, it has a [knock-on] effect on everything else you have on the sound. It\'s like a chess game—you always have to consider what will happen three or four moves ahead of when you do it."', 'A lot more had changed, gear-wise, at Flyte Tyme than just the console. Jam said, "Basically, everything sonically we had done on the Control record, I got rid of everything there, except for maybe one keyboard, called the Mirage. That\'s the only keyboard I used in common, because I wanted [these songs] to be fresh and have a new sound."', 'While the Oberheim OB-8 replaced the Mirage as Jam\'s go-to keyboard for writing most of this record, the Mirage was used on the first track written for Rhythm Nation, "Miss You Much," as well as on "Escapade" and "Love Will Never Do (Without You)"—all tracks that also featured the use of a new-to-them drum machine called the E-mu SP-1200, which was popular in rap music at the time. Previously, the Jam and Lewis had almost exclusively used a Linn Drum.', '"\'Escapade\' happened because I plugged in the [SP-1200] and started playing a beat, and [Janet] said, \'That sounds like one of those beats you hear at a basketball game, and everybody gets up and starts cheering. I want a song like that.\' So we were like, \'Cool.\' She came up with the lyrical ideas for it, and it just had that type of feel."', "A crowd-rousing anthem and two love songs, however, doesn't necessarily sound like the hard-hitting, socially conscious record that Rhythm Nation 1814 turned out to be. And that's because, at that time in the recording process, that's not necessarily what the trio was planning for. Rather, what motivated the direction that the album eventually took was the constant glow of CNN playing on the studio TV, always informing them of the most recent school shooting, overdose, or act of violence.", '"You couldn’t help but somehow be impacted by the things that were going on. It was a crazy time," Jam said in 2014. "The Reagan years were ending. There were school shootings. There were all these unbelievable things starting to happen. We’re all sitting around watching this going, \'Man, that’s messed up. Somebody needs to do something about this.\'"', 'It\'s moments like that in which songs like "Livin\' in a World (They Didn\'t Make)" were written—that one specifically taking Lewis not ten minutes to pen the lyrics for in the wake of the Cleveland Elementary School shooting that took place in January \'89.', 'What really solidified the concept of the album is its titular track, the opener, "Rhythm Nation." The idea for the song came to Jam while the group was out to dinner and Sly and the Family Stone\'s "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)" came onto the radio. Passively not-quite-listening, as you do, to a song he\'s heard a million times, Jam\'s ear all of a sudden caught a two-bar guitar breakdown in the bridge that he\'d never heard in that way before.', 'He told the Red Bull Music Academy, "I remember I went into the studio and all I did was [sample the] two bar guitar loop [with an AMS 1580) and put it in and started putting Linn drums over top of it. It was all I really had, and then, the little string line came and the song came together. Once this happened, we all knew what the direction of the record would be."', 'Once they had this purpose and direction, the sound of the record became much more industrial. It included sounds of the city and of the world the songs were about—glass breaking, trashcan lids smacking, feet stomping, and more. To get these sounds, they turned to the Sequential Circuits Drumtraks and particularly tuned its 13 drums sounds in just a way that made them sound like the real-world cacophony they were after.', 'Unlike most producers of the day, Jam and Lewis insisted on playing by hand and didn\'t sequence anything. Hodge told Sound on Sound, "They even had alternate patterns ready that they would hit a button and have them come up in the song, all on the fly. The beat was quantised, but the fills and turnarounds weren\'t, and that makes a huge difference in the feel of the track. We also overdubbed cymbals and other percussion live, just before we mixed."', 'In the same way that Jackson insisted on singing all of her parts so that what you were hearing was truly a "Janet record," the fact that Jam and Lewis played by hand makes this music feel quintessentially theirs as well, infused with so much of their natural character.', 'After the six months of Rhythm Nation sessions wrapped, the album was mixed and released on September 19, 1989. It saw record-breaking success, being the first record in the history of the US Billboard singles chart to have seven of its singles peak in top-five positions. It became the best-selling album in the U.S. in 1990 and has gone on to be certified platinum six times by the RIAA.', "And today, 30 years later, it's still considered to be one of Jackson's finest albums—a socially conscious, hard-hitting commentary on the times, and one we could all get something out of revisiting today.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

There were a handful of precedents, but it was Fender that defined the instrument as a commercially viable product with its remarkable Precision Bass, launched in 1951. In the years that followed, the key question at first was who would actually play this new kind of guitar? Was it aimed at players of upright string-basses who wanted something more portable, or players of regular guitars who sensed the potential for extra work?", 'One answer came with an instrument launched just a few years after Fender\'s bass went on sale. Nathan "Nat" Daniel had started out back in the \'30s making amplifiers, including models for Epiphone\'s early Electar brand. He set up on his own as Danelectro in New Jersey in 1946, supplying amps to mail-order firms. In \'54, he began making guitars, at first with cloth- or vinyl-covered bodies, and a little later he introduced the U series.', 'The new $75 single-pickup U-1 and $100 two-pickup U-2 models were built unconventionally, following Nat\'s emphasis on cheap materials and simple production methods, using a pine frame topped and backed with a shaped sheet of Masonite (a brand of fiberboard) and edged with vinyl. The instruments had clear plastic pickguards, distinctive headstocks, "split-shell" pickup cases made from lipstick tubes, and—on the two-pickup guitars—"television-type" stacked controls offering a volume and tone per pickup.', "Also on offer from '56 was an unusual companion to the two regular models, the UB-2 six-string bass.", "The UB-2 had a scale length around 30 inches, placing it almost exactly midway between Fender's 34-inch P-Bass scale and 25 1/2-inch Telecaster scale. Danelectro figured that with Fender's bass facing some uncertainty about its purpose and intended market, a hybrid six-string bass could potentially appeal to both camps of players who might be interested. This was the first Dan'o bass, and for now the firm offered no regular four-string variety.", 'A contemporary catalogue boldly described the UB-2: "A brand new instrument that combines the best qualities of Spanish guitar and big string bass." The $135 UB-2 was "a six-string guitar with extra-long neck and extra-long strings," it continued. "Twenty-four frets, two full octaves on each string, total range of four octaves. Neck joins body at 17th fret. Tuning is the same as on a regular guitar, but one octave lower."', 'Nat Daniel told me later about his thinking behind the UB-2. "People started making bass guitars, and it was no big deal for us to switch from guitars to basses," he said. "We simply made the neck a bit longer. We started with a six-string bass, because it\'s hardly any more trouble than a four-string and it gave the player something more for the same money. It took time for that to catch on, but if the player was capable, he had more stuff to play with."', "Explanations were evidently necessary in this new and unfamiliar world of low-tuned guitars, and the '50s Dan'o catalogue went on to spell out some possible applications for the innovative UB-2 to assist any musicians still wondering how they might use the Danelectro innovation.", '"Since the bottom four strings are tuned exactly the same as a big string bass, this instrument makes a perfect bass, except for bowing. Total range is much greater than that of a conventional bass, so that the playing of melody, chords, and riffs can be accomplished as on regular guitar. This instrument is terrific for rhythm and melody, and simply cannot be beat for combining both." There was a final thought, too, to tempt the still unconvinced: "With it you will stand out from the crowd."', 'Danelectro replaced the UB-2 in 1958 with a model in each of two new lines. The $150 Long Horn 4623 six-string bass had a remarkable design, the body retaining the pine-frame and fiberboard construction of the U models but now boasting a striking look thanks to a pair of extremely deep cutaways. It came on like some sort of modern electric lyre.', "The other new model was the $85 Short Horn 3612 six-string bass, a stubby little fellow with just 15 frets. (At the time, a Fender Precision listed at $219.50.) Also, there were now regular Dan'o four-string basses alongside these new six-strings. A few other companies began to make six-string basses, including in 1959 Gibson with its hollowbody EB-6 and, notably, in 1961 Fender with its solidbody VI.", 'Players were gradually discovering the benefits of the new electric bass guitars, primarily the four-string variety, and often this was a Fender Precision. The first US No. 1 single to feature the instrument may have been "Jailhouse Rock," topping the chart for Elvis in late 1957, with Bill Black\'s P-Bass evident. Among others, Joe Maudlin switched from upright bass to a Precision for Buddy Holly\'s tours in \'58, and Jet Harris played his on stage and in the studio with The Shadows, including his work on their 1960 UK No. 1 "Apache."', "Danelectro's six-string basses seemed to prove more of a draw for guitarists than bassists, and one of the most prominent was Duane Eddy. In 1959, he walked into a guitar store in Hollywood and saw a Long Horn 4623 six-string bass. Intrigued, the king of twang bought it on the spot.", '"I thought, Hey, maybe somebody who likes my sound has made a whole guitar based around it," Duane told me with a smile. "I did practically the whole next album on that guitar, The Twang\'s The Thang, things like \'Blueberry Hill,\' \'Night Train To Memphis\'—I think there\'s only one or two, like \'Trambone,\' that I used my regular Gretsch 6120 on. And then the next year I did one of the biggest singles I ever had, \'Because They\'re Young,\' with the Danelectro. By that time, I had also bought a black UB-2, which looked a little better."', 'Another Duane hit, "Rebel Rouser," recorded in early \'58, featured two bass players, with Jimmy Simmons on upright bass, providing depth and tone to the bassline, and Buddy Wheeler playing the same notes on electric bass, adding a percussive, attacking edge. Duane\'s producer, Lee Hazlewood, called this click bass.', 'The technique, often with a Dan\'o six, turned up on other records made around the time, notably in Nashville where it was called tic-tac bass. There was Elvis\'s "Stuck On You" (Bob Moore on upright, Hank Garland on six-string bass), Patsy Cline\'s "I Fall To Pieces" (Bob Moore on upright, Harold Bradley on Danelectro six-string bass), and quite a few others.', 'Today, Danelectro\'s original idea for the six-string bass has settled into the instrument we know as the baritone guitar, available now from makers such as ESP, Gretsch, Ibanez, Reverend, Schecter, and more, including the revived Danelectro brand (and, until 2011, the Jerry Jones Dan\'o-inspired baritones). They have scale lengths between about 26 and 30 inches and are often tuned B-to-B or A-to-A (with typical string sets around .014–.068) but also as "traditional" E-to-E six-string bass (string sets around .020–.090).', "Meanwhile, the modern six-string bass, developed in the '80s, is a completely different animal. It takes the regular four-string bass and extends it either side, with (usually) a lower B-string and a higher C-string, all on a necessarily much wider neck—and the modern five-string bass usually just adds the low B.

They were designed to be mobile sources of information and pleasure that the reader could take pretty much anywhere, to be absorbed, passed around, and generally enjoyed.', "Today, the printed magazine is in decline as many publishers—existing and new, big and small—have transferred or started online. Moving or establishing what has traditionally been a printed item into this quite different medium came with its own set of advantages and problems. It all marked the latest in the magazine's long history of shifts in fashion and changes of presentation.", "Magazines have been published on every conceivable subject. My own favorites include Laundry & Cleaning Today, Modern Ferret, and of course The Doorknob Collector (yes, they really do all exist). However much those journals might excite the imagination, we're going to indulge ourselves here in a brief history of the English-language guitar magazine.", "Among the first magazines to cover guitar matters was S.S. Stewart's Banjo And Guitar Journal, first published in Philadelphia in 1882. Samuel Swaim Stewart was a banjo player who ran a school for the instrument, and he had a factory making S.S. Stewart banjos and sold Stewart guitars made by other companies. He launched the Journal unashamedly to promote his banjos and printed-music business, with guitars something of an also-ran.", "Stewart's magazine was renamed S.S.Stewart's Banjo, Guitar And Mandolin Journal in 1899 during a time known as the BMG Movement, named for the notable contemporary rise in popularity of the banjo, mandolin, and guitar. Other magazines followed Stewart's example, including Cadenza, founded by the music publisher Clarence L. Partee, based originally from 1894 in Kansas City, then from 1900 in New York City, and from 1907 in Boston and with a new owner, Walter Jacobs.", "In Britain, the banjo player, composer, instrument maker, and music publisher Clifford Essex launched BMG magazine in 1903. It had a brief interlude calling itself The Guitarist in 1973, even featuring such amplified players as John McLaughlin and Eric Clapton on the cover, but it was soon back to BMG and its regular coverage of mostly acoustic matters. It continues today, and as such qualifies as probably the world's longest-running guitar-related magazine.", "Historically important, for sure, but these were magazines of their time (how could it be any other way?), and they reflected the guitar's still relatively lowly position among the other fashionable fretted instruments of the moment. It would take the pop music revolution of the '60s to properly start what we would recognize today as the modern guitar magazine.", "With the explosion of guitar-based pop music in the late '50s and early '60s, it was inevitable that a new type of magazine would appear. Before charting some of those moves, though, we need to deal quickly with a technical matter. Publishing people refer to two broad types of specialist magazine: horizontal and vertical. These have nothing to do with the ideal position of the reader, but rather the subject matter. A horizontal magazine covers all varieties of a given topic, while a vertical magazine concentrates entirely on one specific variety.", "The first magazine aimed at wannabe pop musicians who fancied their chances on the '60s music scene was just such a horizontal object, and at first it was called Beat Monthly, though it became better known by its slightly later name, Beat Instrumental. It was first published in 1963 by Sean O'Mahony in London (and later that year O'Mahony, a man evidently with a finger on the popular pulse, would launch The Beatles Book Monthly).", "The first issues hovered between a fan's magazine and a musician's magazine, but Beat soon settled down to concentrate to cover not only guitars but also the other gear that pop musicians were interested in—keyboards, drums, amps, PA, and so on—all poured into the medium's traditional categories of interviews, features, news, letters, ads, and so on. It established the idea of a pop music magazine about playing rather than hairstyles.", 'Britain also had a thriving national weekly pop press, and the granddaddy of them all, Melody Maker, first appeared way back in 1926. It quickly established a significant readership among musicians as well as fans, and by the time Beat appeared, MM had a lively and well used small-ads section for musicians wanted and instruments for sale.', "Editorial content aimed at players and their gear was limited in MM to a regular Expert Advice column. For years this had centered on the paper's core readership of dance-band musicians, but by 1964 the new pop stuff was creeping in.", 'A column that year had a few of the usual troubled enquiries from budding clarinetists and trombonists, but also a request for identification of the type of guitar spotted in a photo of Roy Orbison (apparently a Gretsch Country Club) and the method employed by The Rolling Stones to get a Bo Diddley sound ("a lot of tremolo, plus a bottleneck by Brian Jones").', 'Later, MM would devote whole editorial pages to reviews and features aimed at musicians, and another British weekly paper, Sounds, launched in 1970, also did a good job with this kind of coverage.', 'In the mid-\'60s, Bud and Maxine Eastman opened a music store, Eastman Studios–Guitar Showcase, in San Jose, California, and then a few years later decided to set up a magazine for guitarists. They launched Guitar Player in 1967, and in the first issue, editor Maxine (under the name Maxine Stock) wrote: "A strong international voice of, by, and for guitar players everywhere has been needed for some time. Here, then, is the inside story, the information you want and need as an amateur or professional. It doesn\'t matter if you play Indonesian folk songs or Arkansas chicken rock, this publication is for you." She added: "We can\'t please everyone, but we\'ll try."', 'At last, here was the first "vertical" guitar magazine for the modern player—and, as Stock said, one of the notable things about GP right from the start was the range of music it covered. That first issue included Charlie Byrd and Jefferson Airplane, and later ones from \'67 had The Byrds, a photo essay on the Magic Mountain festival, an introduction to Mance Lipscomb, and a piece headed "Why Can\'t You Read Music?" among many others.', "All this set the tone for the way GP invited new readers in by covering the latest stuff and then pointed them to music and players and gear and subjects they might not have heard about—which sums up what any good magazine should be about. Jim Crockett was the editor who steered the magazine into the '70s, creating a home for many fine journalists, not least the excellent Tom Wheeler, who edited GP from 1981 to 1991, and Michael Molenda, who was editor from 1997 until 2018.", "More guitar-centric magazines followed in Guitar Player's footsteps. They included Guitar, started in England in 1972, Guitar World, begun in New York City in 1980, Guitar For The Practicing Musician, founded in the same city in 1982, and Guitarist, started in England in 1984. The Guitar Magazine appeared in England in 1991, and two new British titles were introduced in 1994, Guitar Techniques and Total Guitar. An early example of online-only was Guitar Interactive, launched in 2011 with no print edition, effectively a digital representation of a page-turning magazine.", "One of the most familiar components of today's guitar magazines is the gear review. Reviews should offer useful criticism of a new instrument, amp, or accessory, and magazines have been publishing them for years, with the best and most seasoned reviewers bringing a wealth of experience that can be invaluable to the reader in search of objective information.", "However, reviews were rare until the early '70s, and American magazines took longer to include them, with the British magazine Beat Instrumental something of a pioneer. This is all tied up with commerce: Reviews are the place where the line between editorial and advertising can become blurred. Why is this brand chosen for review rather than that one? How unbiased are the reviewer's comments? Astute readers will come to trust reviewers who tell the truth.", 'Alongside the broadly guitar-based magazines, others appeared aiming more precisely at specialist strands.', "Pickin' was started in 1974, at first concentrating on fretted instruments in bluegrass and old-time country music, and later merging with Frets (not to be confused with the Fender-related Fretts magazine). Acoustic Guitar was started in 1990 and provided a stylish and impressive home for matters unplugged, and in the UK, Acoustic was introduced in 2004, while the American Fretboard Journal first appeared in 2005.", "Steel guitarists were served by two US magazines, Steel Guitarist, launched in the mid-'90s, and later Steel Guitar World. There have been several bass and classical-guitar magazines, too, but these are beyond the scope of our survey here.", 'Vintage fans who wanted a dedicated magazine might have seen Mugwumps, begun in 1971 as a place for classic acoustic guitars, banjos, and mandolins. The more focussed Vintage Guitar Magazine was launched in 1989, growing from The Music Trader to comprehensively cover all matters retro and collectable. A year later, 20th Century Guitar appeared, which managed to survive several years into the 21st century without, appropriately, the need to change its name. Guitar Aficionado was the most recent arrival among these US-based vintage magazines, aiming itself squarely at the high-end collector of the 2010s.', "Many of these titles have changed owners since they were launched, some several times. Some magazines have since moved steadily to digital forms, online and through apps, and some have entirely abandoned their print editions. Others have disappeared altogether in what can be a cutthroat business. We don't have the space here to mention every single guitar magazine ever published, of course, but we've tried to cover the main ones.", "I grew up editing and writing for print magazines, so I am certainly biased. But I still prefer magazines when they're physical objects. Printing is hundreds of years old, and the process has had plenty of time to reach today's highly advanced state.", "Digital systems are much younger and still developing, and in my view they do not yet quite match print for versatility, practicality, or quality in magazines. Digital magazine technology can only improve, though, and the format is clearly an important part of today's guitar-related publishing and, presumably, its future. And, of course, the ability to watch and hear gear demos and guitar lessons—as opposed to merely reading them—certainly has its benefits.", "Premier Guitar is an American publication covering a wide spectrum of guitar matters, and it was among the first to demonstrate the value of online. Jon Levy, PG's publisher, says that ever since the debut issue's appearance in February 2007, the magazine has been committed to multimedia.", '"I guess you could say that online is in our DNA," he says. He knows guitarists are hungry for high-quality information and content, and that they look for it today in magazines, on websites, via mobile, and on social media. "Premier Guitar simply wants to provide these guitarists with the content that they crave, anywhere they choose to access it. For this reason," Jon says, "our magazine has always been available for free online, in its entirety."', 'Christopher Scapelliti is Guitar Player\'s editor-in-chief, and he\'s well aware of the magazine\'s position as the longest-running of the modern guitar publications. He says GP has always had what he calls a "laser focus" on tone, technique, and gear, on telling stories that provide insights into guitarists\' backgrounds and experiences.', '"We remain true to that today," he says, "whether we\'re speaking with a player about a new or old album, a tour, or how they approach their instrument. Our history is an abiding guide to our present."', 'Jamie Dickson is editor-in-chief at Guitarist, the longest-running of the modern British guitar magazines. "We have a long-standing and hugely important relationship with our regular readers, some of whom have been buying the magazine since it started over 30 years ago," he says. "That shared history means we understand what those longterm readers want from Guitarist every month—from the kind of gear that they\'re into, to the artists they\'re most inspired by, and so on—which hopefully keeps them coming back for more year after year. The challenge, of course, lies in attracting newcomers to our well-established brand without breaking that successful formula."', 'One thing that can be said of much of the history of guitar magazines—with the notable exception of Maxine Eastman-Jackson and her brief tenure as editor of Guitar Player—is its boys-club legacy. A relative newcomer on the scene, She Shreds, has made it a mission to break that mentality. Founder and Editor-In-Chief Fabi Reyna, speaking with Reverb in 2015, explained her impetus for launching the magazine:', '"One of the biggest setbacks that I faced as a young girl learning guitar was that, in mainstream outlets, which for me meant guitar magazines at a big chain grocery store, was struggling to find role models of substance—meaning not overly sexualized—that I could or wanted to relate to. But, perhaps more than anything, not having the option to choose the way that I wanted to learn and being told: \'If you can’t do it the way it’s supposed to be done, then you’re not a real guitar player.\'"', "In addition to having strong online presence, She Shreds has released 18 (and counting) print issues—all featuring women guitarists and bassists on their covers, including established acts like Sleater-Kinney's Corin Tucker and new talents like Melanie Faye.", "The future of the guitar magazine is, like most things, hard to predict. Jon at Premier Guitar says a lot depends on the evolving role of guitar—and music in general—in popular culture, a complex topic in its own right. He applauds the continuing trend where women and girls are breaking down guitar culture's boys-club legacy, and says the globalization of music will help propel guitar into a bright new future.", '"For the past five or six years," he adds, "we\'ve seen that guitarists want more videos and more mobile-friendly content. We\'ve entered a period of amazing democratization of guitar content, where just about anyone with a mobile device can create content and build their own audience."', 'Christopher at Guitar Player admits that the internet has affected all newsstand sales. "We\'ve seen our subscription numbers go up," he says, "either due to the convenience and price of subscriptions, or to readers making a commitment to what we offer. That trend allows us to focus more on giving our core readers what they want and worry less about appealing to the fringes. So, from that perspective, the future appears to be more boutique, more bespoke. It\'s about serving a more devoted audience with content that speaks directly to their interests."', "Jamie at Guitarist says the future lies in understanding what print magazines do best and then accentuating those things in the print version of the magazine—alongside online content from Guitarist and its publisher’s other music magazines collated at the MusicRadar site. The internet has many virtues, he says, but adds that no screen can make a photograph of a '59 Les Paul look achingly beautiful in the way that a carefully crafted magazine can.", '"In an age where lots of people suffer from screen fatigue at the end of the day, that\'s becoming increasingly relevant and attractive. Print magazines suit detailed, long-form journalism. We\'re not dumbing anything down for clickbait articles, but letting the full story unfold in authoritative, in-depth features adorned by world-leading photography," he says.', 'Quality print magazines have a secret weapon, Jamie says. "Guitarist is staffed by professionals who have honed their knowledge and skills in a rigorous, quality-focused professional environment for years. You can trust what they have to say and immerse yourself in the vivid richness of the presentation." He says those skills do not have to be limited to print production. "They can also be transferred into beautiful video, engaging online features, and arresting social media that makes newcomers passionate about your brand, even before they\'re aware you also publish a world-class print product."', 'Jon at Premier Guitar suggests several ways that guitar media companies ought to react to current trends. They should make their content more approachable and immediately accessible, they should partner with bloggers and other creators, and they should focus on areas where they can offer unique material.', '"Successful guitar magazines will have to be responsive and boldly creative," he concludes. "And, by the way, they need to respect their audiences and have fun while they\'re doing it. If you respect the reader and enjoy a kickass good time together, I think that appeal will withstand the test of time. Technology and tastes may change, but guitarists are attracted by a desire for creativity and community—that\'s what led us to playing the instrument in the first place."', "As I thumbed through old copies of print magazines to research this piece, I couldn't help wondering if it will be possible for the guitar historians of the future to find all the content of this or that outdated digital medium. Anyway, putting that tricky question aside, one fascinating game to play as you thumb or swipe through old and not-so-old guitar magazines is to chart the way fashions come and go, how they return and fade and cycle around again.", "In this old issue, everyone wants to try tapping. In that one, humbucker'd Teles are in vogue. And then, 24 seems a paltry number of frets. Why not throw away your picks, or buy a bottleneck? Let's get into Mixolydian mode! The cool thing is to remove that vibrato system. The slacker the alternate acoustic tuning, the better. And so on—and suddenly, of course, none of the above. And then, naturally, all of the above, again.", 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

The enduring Wolfgang design has survived for nearly 30 years in a series of different guises, and this is the story of its development.", "The guitar originated with an Ernie Ball Music Man model introduced in 1991, followed by a Peavey version that first appeared in 1996. And since 2009, the Wolfgang has been part of the line of products for Eddie's own EVH brand, created in collaboration with Fender. So let's get acquainted with Wolfgang.", 'Eddie Van Halen teamed up with Ernie Ball Music Man in the mid-\'80s, endorsing his 5150 string sets. Then he began talking to them about a guitar, following Music Man\'s introduction of the Silhouette and a Steve Morse signature model a few years later. The result was a surprise for anyone who expected to see something along the lines of Ed\'s famous striped home-assembled concoctions. "I endorsed the guitar I used to play," Ed said in an ad. "I designed this one... Big difference."', "This time, after the demise of that '80s guitar endorsement deal with Kramer, he wanted something designed from the ground up, with quality as the main concern. On board for the quest at Music Man was Dudley Gimpel, who had designed the impressive Silhouette. Ed said it was a huge help working with someone like Dudley, because he had the perfect combination of technical and creative skills.", 'Ed had some rough drawings of a cross between a Telecaster and Les Paul he wanted to try. Together, Ed and Dudley developed the design, deciding how the neck should join the body, figuring out a comfortable placement of the single volume control and pickup switch, selecting the right woods, and so on through the rest of the details.', 'They opted for a relatively lightweight basswood body with a flat maple top. Ed said the old idea that a heavy body meant a good body seemed backwards to him. "We\'re talking about sound here," he told Tom Wheeler in Guitar Player, "not how beautiful it looks—and the maple top actually adds a nice crispness." The headstock was virtually the same as Dudley\'s earlier Silhouette design, an offset four-plus-two with straight string-pull.', "Two pickups was something of an extravagance for Ed, as he'd been used to just the one—mainly because he could never get a pair of pickups to both sound good. Steve Blucher at DiMarzio worked with Ed and Dudley to create a custom balanced pair that did the trick: a fat, warm neck pickup, plus a punchy, slightly louder bridge unit.", 'There was an Ed-style joke with the single control knob: It was a volume, but it was marked "Tone." Ed said: "When you turn it up, you get volume and you get a nice tone. How many people do you actually know that even touch the tone control on a guitar, anyway? On a bass, maybe, but not on a guitar."', 'Another of Ed\'s foibles found its place on the new Music Man model in the setup of its Gotoh-licensed Floyd Rose vibrato. He\'d only ever used his trem to lower pitch, so that\'s what he wanted here. It also fell in with his theory that the more things were connected on a guitar, the more tone and sustain would result. Hence the pickups screwed directly into the body. And no floating vibrato for Ed. "This one is like a stop tailpiece," he told Tom Wheeler, "except you can bring it down. When you\'re not pushing it down, it\'s totally connected to the body."', 'The Music Man Edward Van Halen model first went on sale in 1991. It had a basswood body with flat maple top, various translucent color finish options, a licensed Floyd Rose or hardtail bridge, 22 frets on a 25 1/2" scale, an oiled maple neck with 10" radius board and five-screw fixing to the body, Schaller tuners, a neck-end wheel truss-rod adjuster, two custom DiMarzio humbuckers, a single volume control, and a three-way selector. Ed used an amber flame-top example, one of the earliest prototypes, as his main guitar for several years.', "Eddie Van Halen switched allegiance in the mid-'90s, starting afresh with Peavey as his deal with Music Man ended. (Music Man continued to make the Axis, very similar to the Van Halen signature model.) Ed had already teamed up with Peavey to produce his 5150 amp and cabs in 1992 and a combo version in '95.", "Jim DeCola was supervisor of guitar design engineering at Peavey, where he'd been since 1988. He'd worked on Peavey's Steve Cropper signature model, introduced in '95, along with a number of regular instruments for the product line. Jim first met Ed back when Peavey was courting the Van Halen guitarist for the amp deal, at which time Jim made a guitar—a one-humbucker Strat-style with a Floyd—to show what they could do in that department.", "In fact, when Ed visited the plant in 1990 to talk amps, the guitar he seemed more taken with was the firm's new Peavey Odyssey, a sort of hybrid Tele–Les Paul model. Anyway, the idea went no further because, as we've seen, Ed decided to go with Music Man for his first signature guitar.", "Come 1995, however, with the Music Man deal at an end, Jim made a copy of the Music Man to show they were capable of producing an instrument at the quality level Ed would expect. In March 1995, he showed Ed this guitar during rehearsals in Florida for Van Halen's Balance tour. Ed agreed to go ahead with Peavey on a new signature guitar.", "Jim went back to the Peavey plant and mulled over the various ideas he wanted to incorporate in his design and present to Ed for approval. They began to-ing and fro-ing on the details, a process that lasted most of '95 as Ed took protos out on the road to test proposed features.", 'An early decision was to continue with a basswood body but to make the maple top contoured, in contrast to the flat, thin Music Man top (and perhaps harking back to that carved maple–mahogany Odyssey that Ed had liked). "Basswood does sound great," Jim tells me, "but sometimes it can be a little lackluster, and I think the hybrid basswood–maple really shined."', 'Jim made the body shape somewhat more asymmetrical, which meant the neck could be pushed a little deeper into the body, in turn improving balance. "It didn\'t neck-dive as much as the Music Man, because the tip of the horn was closer to the 12th fret," he says. "And because the neck was deeper into the body, when you\'re reaching for an open E or an F chord, it didn\'t feel as far out. It almost felt like a shorter-scale guitar, but it was still a full twenty-five-and-a-half."', 'Peavey continued with a maple neck, too, adding carbon fiber reinforcement rods, which Jim had tried already on a couple of Peavey basses. "I thought it had a lot of virtue," Jim says, "benefitting the feel and tone of the wood with the added harmonic potential and sustain of the carbon fiber, as well as extra stability. I put the rods in the first prototype I sent to Eddie, and he liked it, so we ended up keeping that feature."', "Ed wanted a small version of a Flying V head, but Jim told him that was impossible, because it still counted as a copy of the Gibson original. Jim remembered a three-and-three staggered headstock on a guitar he'd built for himself, so he shrunk that a little, added a Peavey-like tip, and showed a rough to Ed.", '"Hmm," said Ed. "I see where you\'re going—but I still like the V." Jim repeated his Gibson warning. Ed then made a drawing of a sort of V-notch idea, which Jim said was too close to a Washburn \'70s style. Another drawing. Any good? Nope, too Dean-like.', 'Then Jim told Ed to give him a few minutes while he went off to the workbench. "I took my headstock I\'d done, which had a black-painted face, went out to a spindle sander, and sanded a scoop into the tip of the headstock. I took it back to him, said why don\'t we do that? It had the V shape he was thinking about, and the scoop thing, and it still had the Peavey profile on the outside. And he\'s like, \'Oh yeah, I kinda like that.\' We tried to honor Eddie\'s vision while keeping the Peavey identity."', 'The Music Man guitar had featured a wheel adjuster for the truss rod, a feature that Ed was keen to continue with, but Jim felt it protruded too far and potentially weakened the neck pocket. So he recessed it into the end of the neck, improving stability.', 'For the pickups, Jim started with one from a Frankenstein that Ed liked, and duplicated it accurately, right down to the shorted-out coils. Ed said he liked it but wanted it without the shorting. Prototypes were made, then rejected in favor of something a little warmer. And so followed several months of back and forth. A frustrated Jim felt he was close to exhausting the possibilities. "So finally I sent back the original set of pickups I\'d given him—and then he said, \'Yeah, this is it!\' So it went full circle."', 'The Peavey pickups had a high-ish output, though not, Jim says, to Super Distortion level. "Some people were confused, because there was a higher DC resistance on the neck pickup, lower on the bridge. But they were two different wire gauges, so that\'s why they had two different voices, and they balanced out in terms of output."', 'Controls were a single volume and tone—a prototype with two volumes didn\'t last—where the Music Man had just volume, and the two knobs and switch were placed in a line, providing what Jim felt was a pleasing look within the body outline. The vibrato was a licensed Floyd Rose, made by Ping. "Ed just felt it sounded a bit better," Jim says, "because Floyds tend to get a bit bright and thin sounding. So we settled on a brass block, and that helped the tone."', "The bridge had a D-Tuner that Adam Reiver introduced to Ed. It was a barrel-shaped switch on the low E-string's clamping screw for instant drop-D tuning: left pushed in for regular E (or whatever your preferred low-string tuning); pulled out when you wanted D. Jim made some refinements to its fine-tuning capabilities and Ed gave the go-ahead for its inclusion on the guitar.", 'The Peavey Wolfgang was introduced at NAMM in January 1996, with Ed there to show it off.', '"Our collective efforts in designing the Wolfgang guitar have resulted in a versatile, quality-crafted guitar that feels great, sounds great, and is truly inspiring to play," he was quoted in the official blurb. "I\'ve already put mine to the test in the studio and on tour, and now it\'s your turn."', 'A basswood-only option was added, and a flat-topped, single-knob Wolfgang Special appeared in 1998.', '"The toughest thing about working on Ed\'s guitar was going up against the Music Man," Jim says, "because they were just fabulously crafted guitars. We really had to step up our quality at Peavey to make sure we didn\'t look foolish going up against them. And the way I look at it, the Wolfgang was my life\'s work. I had so much involvement in it, and even though it was Ed\'s model officially, it was really my model. I like to say: I designed it; he approved it."', "After Eddie Van Halen broke with Peavey in 2004, he began a working relationship with Fender, officially announced at NAMM in January 2007. (Peavey later made some HP models that were very similar to its Wolfgang guitars.) Fender had decided the way to attract Ed was to go beyond the Peavey deal for guitars and amps, and to furnish Ed with his own product brand, EVH, made and sold by Fender. The deal followed a run of Ed's Art Series guitars around 2004 with the Fender-owned Charvel brand.", "The first EVH products were amps, followed by a limited-edition detailed re-creation of Ed's Frankenstein. Next, in 2009, came EVH's revised take on the Wolfgang, and Chip Ellis at Fender collaborated with Ed on its design (he had already worked on the Frankenstein). Chip started by compiling a list with Ed of everything he didn't like about the previous incarnations of the Wolfgang.", '"I\'d say a good 90 percent of the features were changed, even very subtle things," Chip tells me. "About the only thing we kept was the silhouette, and the materials were pretty much the same, but we played with top thickness, we played with different finishes, we had nicer aesthetics—nicer woods, nicer binding—and we spent over a year just testing pickups, trying to land on the right ones. I\'ve never worked so hard to get approval on a guitar for production."', "One of Ed's main gripes about his earlier Wolfgang-style guitars was durability. On the road with Van Halen, neck and jack-plate screws would strip out, hardware would get mangled—everything would get tested to the limit and often beyond. All this had to be attended to. And then there were the pickups.", 'Chip had worked with Seymour Duncan for pickups on the EVH Frankenstein replica, so that was the obvious first stop. "They were dialed in to the sound Ed was looking for at that time, and we spent probably three months testing variations of custom pickups from them. I would receive a set, load up a few guitars so we could test \'em, go up to 5150, Ed would plug in, and we\'d try them out."', 'Chip is referring to Ed\'s studio complex, known as 5150. "We could only go about an hour at a time testing pickups, because you tend to lose your ears at that point. Everything starts to sound the same."', 'They got close with the Seymour sets, but not quite. Same thing with DiMarzio. Finally, an engineer at Fender started making samples, and his second set made the grade. "Working in-house at Fender on the pickups helped," Chip says, "because we had the ability to do everything real-time, stand over the engineer, work with him, get a better understanding of what\'s going on."', 'As usual, Ed was taking out prototypes to test on tour. To identify a range of different finishes they were trialing, the guitars had large numbers stenciled on the front. The one Ed played a lot on the 2007–08 Van Halen tour was Number 4. As they got close to selecting the in-house pickup set as the ideal, Ed wondered if the final tweak might be to do with placement.', '"I didn\'t have a router with me to enlarge the pickup cavity on the day we decided to look into that at 5150," Chip says. "So Ed went into his garage and grabbed a crowbar and a hammer. We went out in the driveway, and basically he chiseled this huge pocket so we could move the pickup around in it. If you look at pictures of Number 4 guitar on that tour, it looks like a dog chewed the pickup cavity. But it did the trick! I believe we ended up moving it a thirty-second of an inch, and we found the sweet spot."', "Another consideration was the effect of aging. All along, Ed had been comparing brand-new test guitars with instruments he'd been playing for years. Chip mentioned how some violin makers would blast violin tops with classical music in an attempt to speed up the process. Ed seemed unconvinced.", "A week or two later, Chip visited 5150 for another testing session, and as he opened his car door, he could hear a strange howling noise that seemed to be coming from the studio. He couldn't work out what it was. Ed came along and opened up the studio door, and the howling—now a raging, deafening feedback—was clearly coming from inside.", '"After we\'d had that conversation about the violin tops, Ed decided he\'d try that idea," Chip explains. "So he just turned up a prototype 5153 half stack, dimed everything, leaned the guitar up against it, and left it sitting there feeding back for a week. When we walked in, I said, \'What on earth are you doing!\' He turned back at me with a smirk and said, \'I thought I\'d try your idea.\' And I think," Chip adds with a smile, "he settled on it making no difference at all. But it was a fun experiment—and for the amp, too, to see how long it could do that before it blew up."', 'They sampled eight finishes with the numbered guitars. There was one rubbed with simple gun stock oil, one with only sealer, one with only lacquer, and another with a combination of sealer and lacquer.', '"We also tried something that was new to me," Chip says, "which was an acrylic urethane sprayed thin like a lacquer. Then we tried a polyurethane sprayed thin, we did a thick polyurethane, and we did a thick polyester. And we ended up landing on the thin acrylic urethane."', 'Chip emphasizes that everything they put on the EVH Wolfgang was completely intentional and there for a reason. "It got to the point, about six months into it," Chip says, "when we really started working as a team: Ed, myself, and Matt Bruck, Ed\'s tech. Instead of just designing Ed\'s perfect guitar in his mind, it started to become a group project, where we just wanted to make the most durable, most reliable, most playable, most versatile thing we could."', 'The vibrato system was a case in point. After problems with German Schaller-made Floyd Roses, including a tendency for the saddles to move a little under string tension or dive bombing, they settled on the imported Floyd, made in Korea.', '"It sounded better," Chip recalls, "and we figured it was because Korea was going old-school, using a bent steel baseplate, where at the time the Schaller had a cast plate. Another thing we noticed was that there were pretty sizable gaps—probably 40 to 50 thousandths of an inch, almost the gauge of an E-string—between saddles on the German one, whereas on the Korean they were butted right up to each other. It just seemed more attention to detail, I guess."', "They selected Gotoh's tuners, which were rock-solid and stood up perfectly to Ed's attempts to break or bend the various tuners they tried, along with a cut-out version of the scoop headstock. Stainless steel frets—trialled at Peavey for their version of the Wolfgang but rejected—turned out to be the favored variety on the EVH Wolfgang.", '"One of the first guitars I put those on was one he immediately took out on tour," Chip says. "I think I got it to him about a week before he went on tour, and after the tour was over it looked as if the frets had just been dressed the day before. That was the deciding factor to go with stainless steel fretwire."', 'Another tweak that came from Ed touring with prototypes concerned the volume and tone pots. When Ed tried to play "Cathedral," he found the volume pot a little too stiff to manipulate, an essential for that piece. So the team designed some volume pots with a very low easy-to-spin friction. Then Ed started noticing if he accidentally bumped the tone pot, it could roll back a little without him knowing. So the next step was to develop a tone pot that was harder to rotate. For the knobs themselves, they moved from a Fender-style tone and volume on the early prototypes to Ed\'s favored MXR/Jazz Bass-style knobs.', "After all the work, the first EVH Wolfgang model was finally made available in 2009. Other variants have since been added alongside, including set-neck and hardtail variants, and cheaper models made offshore. Looking back now, it's worth noting again that the original model at Music Man was first sold in 1991. That means it won't be too long before the Wolfgang design celebrates its 30th birthday—a remarkably long lifespan for any electric guitar.", '"I seem to always be refining the design," Ed told The Hub in 2017. "I\'m constantly putzing around with it. You go on tour and you realize what works and what doesn\'t work. It\'s an endless pursuit."', '"This guitar is starting to settle in like a classic," Chip concludes. "And I tend to get so hands-on, almost controlling with it, because I have an obligation to Ed. It\'s got to meet his expectations. Anything that we produce has got to be as good if not better than that prototype he signed off on. I take that very seriously."', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music. He is a co-founder of Backbeat UK and Jawbone Press.

For a brief period—just over six months, ranging from roughly November 1971 through June of the following year—that name appeared sporadically, stamped in red ink, on top of Rhodes harp brackets. While these dates were already considered to yield highly desirable instruments thanks to unrelated but palpable production features, the occasional presence of this stamp has advanced the theory that Buz Watson was an innovator whose work was distinguished enough to stand out from what was otherwise anonymous factory labor.', 'Within the resurgent vintage keyboard market, instruments bearing his name are now often referred to as "Buz Watson models," implying that they contain a special ingredient of sorts that somehow separates them from all other Rhodes pianos. Whether or not this trend can be traced to any tangible qualities within the pianos themselves, however, has proven difficult to ascertain.', 'While it has long been established that the stamp represents a simple mark of quality control, beyond that, very little is known about just who Buz Watson was and what sort of work it was that he was doing. Ironically, the absence of factual knowledge has only contributed to the increasing lore that surrounds this relatively small number of pianos, and Buz Watson—while not quite at Tadeo Gomez levels of renown—is now among the small handful of Fender employees whose names have transcended their job descriptions.', "The popular narrative concerning Buz Watson's employment at Fender is that, following Harold Rhodes' refusal to incorporate Watson's design enhancements into the tine-based piano that bore his name, the disgruntled employee up and left, taking his stamp with him and putting an abrupt end to what, nearly a half-century later, would become the most sought-after electric pianos that were ever produced.", 'Buz, it was said, retreated to his apartment, where, free from management overreach, he would implement his Rhodes modifications for a small private client base. While the romantic image of the idealistic craftsman eschewing corporate business constraints in order to see a vision through may have contributed to the intrigue of the man and his work, the true story of Buz Watson is quite different.', 'Clyde Curtis Watson was born on June 21, 1933, in San Bernardino, California. Enthralled with airplanes—particularly model airplanes—from a young age, he soon earned the moniker "Buz" because there was seemingly always a plane of some sort buzzing around wherever he was present. It was model airplanes that would remain the great passion of Buz\'s life, but there were times when his love for music and baseball vied for the top spot.', 'A grammar school–aged Buz was swept up in the accordion craze of the day, and his quest to master the virtuosic novelty tune "Dizzy Fingers" led to lessons at a local music school. He took to the instrument naturally and was performing in public regularly by the time he was a teenager, most often at talent shows and private parties, but also restaurants where he would serenade diners Lady and the Tramp–style.', 'Considered one of the best high school baseball players in all of California, as well as an honors student who was vice-president of his class, Buz had his sights set on a baseball scholarship to the University of Southern California. Instead, with the Korean War in full swing, he was drafted into the US Army and promptly shipped off to Anchorage, Alaska, where he was tasked with building and repairing helicopter motors.', 'Upon being discharged and returning to California, Buz enrolled in community college and played in a competitive "Night Ball" baseball league, but his serious academic and athletic pursuits were already behind him. While in Alaska, much of his free time had been devoted to teaching himself to play piano, a task made easier by his years of formal accordion lessons. As with the accordion, he progressed quickly, and although he would begin a series of jobs related to the aircraft maintenance that he had learned on Elmendorf Air Force Base, it was the piano that became the focal point of his immediate post-Army years.', "Even in those days before rock 'n' roll, Southern California could still boast of a ripe and eclectic music scene that afforded musicians ample opportunity to ply their trade. Buz was a connoisseur of radio and early television, and the hodgepodge of styles they beamed out is what informed his taste. From swinging big bands, orchestral jazz, and sophisticated show tunes to tropical calypsos, cowboy singalongs, and sentimental schmaltz, Buz listened to and played it all.", "By the latter half of the '50s, he was gigging out at least several nights a week in a variety of settings, be it leading small instrumental groups in nightclubs, accompanying crooners in hotel lounges, filling out dance bands in large halls, or providing background ambience at cocktail parties. Indeed, Buz was among that rare breed of musicians who would perform anywhere and everywhere just for the sheer love of it.", "Buz married in 1961 and the couple would have three daughters before the decade was out. The responsibilities of a growing family necessitated steadier employment, and in the very late '60s, Buz went to work for the Fender Electrical Instrument Company in Fullerton, about a 40-minute drive from his home in Riverside. By this point, the Fender plant—now under the ownership of the CBS conglomeration—had swelled into the largest musical instrument manufacturing facility in the world.", "After years of delays and false starts, the Fender-Rhodes electric piano was added to the company's already star-studded roster of rock 'n' roll tools in 1965 and proved—despite early growing pains in both sound and design—to be yet another success. It was common practice in those days at Fender for new hires with a musical background to be assigned to the production team of the instrument that they played, and that is how Buz first entered into the Rhodes orbit.", 'The Rhodes itself was very much a feat of 20th-century American industrial engineering, with the assembly of every piano broken down into small, repeatable segments. The product would take shape on a rolling conveyor system where stations had prescribed tasks and techs to carry them out.', 'Because each of its hundreds of interlocking parts was mounted and adjusted by hand, pianos could—and often did—vary significantly, with individual laborers operating with a fair amount of discretion. Still, such a process meant that a single worker could exert only so much influence on the piano as a whole. Having had no previous experience with tuning, let alone manufacturing an instrument, Buz received all of his training on the job.', 'Unsurprisingly, he picked up the trade quickly, with his detail-oriented approach landing him the position of "final tech," from which he would soon graduate into "final quality control inspector," the most advanced stations on the factory floor.', 'Final techs (there were two) would receive pianos that had already been completely assembled but still required a thorough setup. Housed in small soundbooths, they were responsible for ensuring that all mechanical parts had been installed and were interacting properly with one another. Subtle adjustments related to the alignment of various components such as the tone bar, pickup rails, and hammers could result in dramatic changes that were often the difference between good and bad pianos, both in feel and tone.', 'Once these alignments were improved and the action had been regulated, the tech would play a brief series of test sequences—assorted intervals, scales, and chord voicings—up and down all registers of the keyboard to check pitch, damper response, and fine-tune the timbre and volume of all individual notes. Following this, the piano was ready for final inspection.', 'While it was the final tech who may have had the most tangible impact on the completed instrument, the final QC inspector was well-versed in every stage of production. After only a year or so, Buz moved into this role, joining one Robert Kehoe, a member of the Rhodes team dating back to its earliest days, at the very end of the line. In addition to a slight wage increase, the appeal of this position stemmed from its lack of monotony. Buz and Bob were responsible for ensuring at least some semblance of consistency across all of the pianos; this required them to verify the work that had been done by the entire Rhodes department, ranging from cosmetics to mechanics to sound and overall playability.', "Although they would often make last-minute tweaks and tuneups, each piano was allotted only about 20 minutes within this station (later shortened to 15 minutes or less), so any piano with significant or time-intensive issues would be sent back to the work area responsible for the gaffe. During particularly busy stretches, longtime Rhodes production manager (and Buz's boss) Ron Roscom would put his own mechanic skills to use and hop in the tiny soundbooth with either Buz or Bob to do larger repairs himself in an effort to save time. When the work was deemed complete, the final QC inspectors would stamp their seal of approval, put the lid on, and press a button that enacted a hydraulic boost that lifted the Rhodes right up from the workbench into a shipping crate and off to its next destination in the world.", "Fender's proximity to Los Angeles and its seemingly endless string of commercial recording studios had the unintended consequence of not-infrequent requests for the factory to dispatch techs to implement various tuneups and adjustments. As the Rhodes began to soar in popularity, Buz was the employee most often deployed on these missions, thanks largely to his mechanical know-how, but also because his own performance background allowed him to communicate with other keyboard players naturally.", 'Through a combination of satisfied customers and rising demand, this traveling serviceman role soon began to extend beyond Fender. While still a full-time staffer on the assembly line, Buz started taking on freelance Rhodes work. Although the moonlighting was sporadic at first, it was a harbinger of things to come.', 'The scope of these onsite jobs could vary significantly—with the most frequent request by far being for a lighter, more responsive action—but they brought the underlying issue of manufacturing inconsistencies to the forefront. Buz was hardly the only worker on the line to voice concern about the compromises that mass production put on an instrument that relied so heavily on its assembly and setup to achieve peak performance. Harold Rhodes, whose own striving for perfection nearly kept his creation from going into production at all, was a frequent visitor on the factory floor, chatting cordially with the workers and always open to suggestions and potential improvements. He appreciated Buz not only for his meticulous approach but also for the jazzy renditions of old pop standards that Buz would reel off on the nearest Rhodes at his request.', 'Rather than advocating for specific design overhauls, Buz frequently implored Harold to enact more stringent quality guidelines and checks, an advancement that would have resulted in superior pianos, but which was little more than a pipe dream. CBS was in the business of selling instruments and, as Fender\'s marketing guru Don Randall noted, the Rhodes was selling "by the truckload." Incremental improvements could not come at the cost of decreased sales.', "The fact that Buz's now famous inspector's mark appeared for such a brief period has fostered the notion that his tenure at Fender was short-lived, with the disappearance of the stamp taken as a sign of his departure from the factory. Fender's company-wide QC markings, however, were in constant flux, evolving gradually from the hastily penciled names and initials hidden inside the groundbreaking solidbody guitars of the early '50s into a more formalized system.", 'CBS evidently preferred that their products not showcase the names of factory workers, no matter how concealed they may be, and instituted a mandate for more generic branding. Thus, the absence of Buz\'s stamp equated not to his exit, but rather to the growing influence of a corporate entity. Bob Kehoe\'s less celebrated "B. Kehoe" QC stamp, for instance, appeared for the same short stint as Buz\'s, but Bob remained in the final inspector role at the factory right up until Rhodes production ceased in 1985. Buz may very well have had that same type of longevity on the Rhodes line had it not been for turmoil in his personal life. He left Fender at the end of 1975 following a contentious divorce.', "The legend of Buz Watson began to take form only after he had left the Fullerton factory. Buz's service calls had been a resounding success, with many of the biggest studios of the era lauding his Rhodes improvements. While his freelance work heretofore had been confined almost entirely to studios, as well as an occasional house call for pop stars such as Leon Russell or Richard Carpenter, he began offering his Rhodes modifications from his home once he was no longer employed by Fender.", "Word had trickled down from the studios to LA's hotbed of musicians about a tech who was capable of getting things out of a Rhodes that no one else could. Hyperbole or not, that soon became the belief shared among many of California's keyboard players. Buz's timing was impeccable. The Rhodes was reaching the zenith of its popularity, becoming a ubiquitous presence on stages and recordings across all genres of popular music. Desire for his services was such that, rather than looking for new employment, he decided to ride the Rhodes wave for as long as it could sustain him.", "Buz's enthusiasm for building and flying model planes had never waned but his newfound freelance status afforded him the time to immerse himself in his beloved pastime with a renewed fervor. Ever the entrepreneur, he soon parlayed this passion into an additional source of income, designing and building models on commission for other zealous hobbyists. It was the countless hours spent bringing intricate little wooden planes, boats, and cars to life that had made Buz a perfectionist in the first place and he applied that same handiwork to the Rhodes.", 'His modest apartment was transformed into a makeshift workshop that was overrun with the tools of his trades, as pianos in various states of repair contended with outspread plane wings and propellers and RC engines for precious counter and table space. Colorful WWII-era fighter planes that Buz was particularly proud of hung down from the ceiling, and the persistent smell of solder and glue filled the stale air. While much of this sort of labor was tedious, it was the kind of detailed craftsmanship that Buz adored, and hours could slip by without his attention being diverted from the task before him.', "During his marriage, Buz's musical career had been restricted to living room performances on the family's Baldwin home organ. He had missed the nightclub circuit and jumped back into it immediately, working on the models and pianos all through the day before hurrying off to a gig or rehearsal that would last late into the night. Soon, however, there was a backlog of electric pianos awaiting his touch. To meet the rising demand, he enlisted the help of an old friend from Fender, Stephen Woodyard.", "Woodyard was something of a renaissance man at the Fullerton factory, starting off as a guitar and amp tech before transferring to the Rhodes R&D department, where he would eventually head the design of the cult classic Rhodes Mark V. In the mid-'70s, he was overseeing the factory's service and repair center and had become well-acquainted with common customer complaints and requests as they related to the Rhodes.", 'An excellent tech himself, he acted as Buz\'s liaison with the factory, keeping him well-stocked on parts and up-to-date on the latest Rhodes developments. Intermittently over the next several years, Woodyard would finish up work at Fender and head straight over to Buz\'s to help out on the "night shift."', "If there was no discernible difference in pianos that passed through Buz's inspection at the factory, the same could not be said for those that arrived at his home. Fender, he often lamented, wasn't arranged to manufacture quality instruments but rather to spew out as much product in the shortest amount of time possible. Buz saw his work not so much as an upgrade as it was an attempt for the Rhodes to meet its full potential.", 'As his reputation became established, he lined up several modified pianos in his already cramped living quarters that showcased the varying degrees of his alterations. Incoming customers would compare the differences and choose the feel and tone that they wanted applied to their own Rhodes.', 'The procedure most commonly requested of him was what he referred to as a "complete rebuild," or as many of his clients dubbed it, the "Buz Watson Mod." This included standard tweaks such as tuning, voicing, and escapement and strike line checks, but the adjustments that distinguished it were related to the action, hammer tips, and the relationship between the tines and pickups.', 'Using small razors and hobby knives, Buz would reshape the notoriously heavy action into an early variation of what eventually became known as the pedestal bump mod, altering the degree of lightness based on individual preference. To combat the dull, dead sound of many of the pianos that rolled off the line, he installed harder hammer tips that sweetened the tone and brought out the bell-like quality of the tines, allowing the upper registers to "sing" more clearly.', 'The overall timbre of the Rhodes, he would explain, was dependent on the distance of the pickups from the tines. Like the rhythm and treble pickups of an electric guitar, adjustments could be made to emphasize a tone that, as he put it, could be either "chime-y" or "melodic." Tweaking that distance slightly to achieve the desired sound, he would listen for proper volume and attack while also bringing out subtle overtones that he said were hidden within the tines.', 'In place of his old factory stamp, pianos that received these special treatments displayed his business card on the harp, a touch that would be mimicked by Rhodes techs generations later.', "Some of Buz's success had stemmed from being the first to offer Rhodes customizations at a time when the instrument was still a new and relatively unknown commodity. Before long, however, there were independent keyboard techs springing up all along the California coast. While not quite at its mid- and late-'70s peak, business still remained steady, with Buz branching out and tuning Wurlitzer electric pianos and even an occasional acoustic piano.", 'In the early \'80s, Chuck Monte offered to train Buz to install his "Dyno My Piano" Rhodes modifications that were dominating smooth jazz and R&B at the time. Buz could\'ve used the extra work, but, never one to shy away from sharing his opinion, he declined the offer, saying that he couldn\'t stand the sharp, heavily chorused sound.', "Soon, however, it didn't matter. Music was changing rapidly, with digital synthesizers, keyboards, and sequencers coming to dominate the field. Electro-mechanical instruments suddenly seemed hopelessly outdated, and their steady decline was put to rest once and for all with the explosion of the Yamaha DX7, which, ironically, included a rather thin-sounding Rhodes emulation among its most famous presets.", 'After the demise of the Rhodes, Buz returned full-time to airplane-related work, increasing his model output and taking on a mechanic position at the Chino Airport, where he specialized in building and restoring light aircraft engines.', 'He continued performing regularly through the \'90s, adapting, perhaps surprisingly, a fully modern keyboard rig, complete with MIDI workstations and lead synthesizers. He was, by all accounts, enjoying himself, flying his models in Orange County\'s Mile Square Park on many mornings and routinely entering his builds into "fly-in" competitions all over the West Coast on weekends. In 2000, he retired to Florida, where he kept up a similar schedule that was heavy on model making and piano playing. He passed away in February 2005 from complications related to heart disease.', "Buz's earlier career at Fender had often increased his prestige in the eyes of his private clients. Years after the fact, however, his renowned in-home modifications became conflated with the factory-setup pianos that bore his name. The myths surrounding Buz Watson and the Rhodes were, in fact, rooted in reality—people have just been looking for the signs of them on the wrong pianos.", 'I was first introduced to the name "Buz Watson" through my friend, the late Moogy Klingman. While touring California in early 1974 as a co-founding member of Todd Rundgren\'s Utopia, Moogy had his Rhodes serviced by Buz at his home. That Rhodes was featured prominently on the band\'s debut album, recorded just a few months after Buz had applied his modifications. Close to 30 years later, I purchased that same Rhodes from Moogy and became interested in Buz\'s work because of that connection.', 'While I was convinced that I had one of the best-sounding Rhodes pianos in the world, I did not think much about Mr. Watson again until his name began popping up on the internet several years later. To my surprise, I was not the only one who cared about this seemingly obscure individual. What was being written about Buz, however, focused almost entirely on pianos that featured his Fender factory QC stamp, rather than those with the in-home mods that I had become so familiar with.', "Although Moogy's colorful reflections on his brief encounter with Buz provided a vivid backdrop for me to work from, my personal search to learn more about him stalled many times before finally stumbling upon his birth name while searching through old newspaper archives at the Los Angeles Central Library. That discovery gradually led me to various relatives, friends, and coworkers, who were able to help me piece together the story of his life and work.", "In addition to the help of many others, including several of his in-home clients, I am particularly indebted to Buz's brother, Bruce Watson, and his Fender co-worker, Stephen Woodyard.", 'About the author: John Varrallo is a New York City-based musician and songwriter.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Buy, sell, and discover more about your favorite instruments.", 'Carlos Santana and his band had just finished an electrifying set at the Woodstock festival, and their amps remained on stage while John Sebastian performed solo for half an hour or so. Then the next act, The Keef Hartley Band, came on. Miller Anderson was the 24-year-old guitarist and singer. "We had to use Santana\'s equipment," he tells me, recalling events from almost exactly 50 years ago at this Aquarian Exposition, as it was billed on posters.', 'You\'ll have heard Joni Mitchell\'s documentary song "Woodstock" and its famous lyric: "By the time we got to Bethel, we were half a million strong." OK, not quite—but that\'s how it ought to have gone. The Woodstock festival took place more than 50 miles from Woodstock, on farmland near Bethel, New York, over a long weekend in mid-August 1969. It was called Woodstock simply because it was organized by a company called Woodstock Ventures. Word travelled fast about the final location, especially when it became a free event, and soon the roads around the site were overrun with funseekers.', '"We couldn\'t take our hired equipment to the site because of the traffic chaos, so we had to take what we could by helicopter," Miller continues. "I had my Telecaster, and when I got on to the stage for our set, I plugged into Carlos\' amp." It was an early Bob Gallien amp, a GMT 226A. "There was a bank of knobs with nothing written on any of them. No tone, no volume, nothing. So this amp was squealing away as I faced it, trying to figure how to get a sound out of it, fiddling with these unmarked controls—and all this with half a million people at my back."', "Not a great start for this British band's first-ever gig in the US. They'd flown in from England the previous day to kick off a six-week tour intended to promote their Halfbreed album. There was no such thing as an itinerary, so as they relaxed in the unfamiliar surroundings of a chauffeured limo that took them from JFK to their first stop, Miller asked their host from the record company where they were going. She replied that they were heading to a small town in upstate New York. Miller knew this was a rural location, but not much more. A barn dance, perhaps? He asked if it was a dance.", '"By now, she could see the piece of straw hanging out my mouth. She said, \'No, man! It\'s a festival.\' Then I really put my foot in it. I said, \'Are there any other bands playing?\' She said, \'What?\'" After a brief pause, she explained that The Who, Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane, and many others were due to appear, that it was shaping up to be a big deal. Miller decided to look out of the window. "I said, \'Oh, really. I didn\'t know that.\'"', "On the Saturday of the festival, once Miller got Carlos' weird amp working reasonably well, the Keef Hartley Band hit its stride. He was playing his '64 Olympic White Telecaster, bought a few years earlier from Jim Marshall's shop in west London, since when it had been the recipient of a handmade bridge and new tailpiece.", "Miller's Telecaster aside, Fender was not the most popular guitar brand at the festival. A very unscientific and necessarily incomplete analysis of movie footage and stills from the event—some pristine, some murky and blurred—reveals that Gibson guitars were the most plentiful at Woodstock by quite a margin. This is why we need to examine the guitars of Woodstock, an exercise that provides an interesting snapshot of trends in late-'60s guitar fashion: Gibson was in the lead, with Martin in second place, and Fender and Guild joint third.", 'The most-favored Gibson models were SGs, just ahead of Les Pauls. Remember this was 1969, a time when Gibson had only just got around to reintroducing a few original-style Les Paul models following their earlier withdrawal. What we might call vintage snobbery was not yet advanced, and some of the guitarists who chose to play Les Pauls at Woodstock opted for the new stuff.', 'The year before the festival, 1968, John Fogerty had bought the gorgeous new Custom that he played for some of Creedence Clearwater Revival\'s set early on Sunday morning. Another fan of the new was Henry McCullough, who used his \'68 Goldtop with Joe Cocker, notably for an energized take on "With A Little Help From My Friends."', "But let's not forget a trio of decidedly old-school Pauls on show: Larry Lee's Les Paul Custom with Jimi Hendrix, probably Jimi's own '55 loaned out for the day; Leslie West's single-cut sunburst Junior with Mountain, probably a '58; and Al Wilson's wonderfully battle-scarred Goldtop with Canned Heat, probably a '54.", "Carlos Santana was one of the Woodstock SG fans, and his Special was something of a testbed. It looked as if he had moved the original Maestro vibrato to the rear of the body, leaving it there apparently and rather oddly unattached, and then had fitted a new Tune-o-matic bridge in front of a bar tailpiece. His more understandable move had been to swap his SG's original tuners for sturdier Grovers, a common enough mod at the time.", 'Santana played one of the standout performances at the festival, and so did The Who, early on Sunday morning.', "Pete Townshend, too, played an SG Special, a model he'd been using since late the previous year. The Who had played a dramatic set, with Pete at one point investigating his SG's potential as a weapon to remove from the stage a stoned Abbie Hoffman, who'd decided mid-set that he'd like to make some sort of political announcement through the PA.", 'Toward the end of The Who\'s performance, on "Naked Eye," Pete and SG were featured in a semi-solo spot. He moved his guitar around, crouched down to play, and then held it aloft. Finally he sent it crunching into the stage a few times. Oddly, the thin-bodied SG seemed to resist, so Pete gave up, left it to feed back for a moment, and then threw it into the crowd. Fortunately, it was quickly retrieved.', "Jerry Garcia played an SG Standard with The Grateful Dead on Saturday night, a guitar he used alongside an earlier Standard for most of 1969 and into '70. An SG Standard was also the choice of Barry Melton with Country Joe & The Fish on Sunday evening, and Johnny Winter used one for part of his set, round midnight the same day.", 'Following Johnny came Blood, Sweat & Tears, and Steve Katz, too, had an SG. Watching the patchy but convincing video evidence today, Steve tells me: "Most of the time with Blood, Sweat & Tears I played a 335. So—I guess I played a red SG Standard at Woodstock. If I wasn\'t so stoned that night, I probably would have remembered."', "The ES-335 family was out and about, too. John Till played a 335 with Janis Joplin, but a bigger splash came when Ten Years After took to the stage on Sunday evening. Alvin Lee played his dot-neck cherry 335, which he'd bought in his hometown of Nottingham, England, in 1963 for 45 guineas. Soon he added a Bigsby, and also a Strat rear pickup between the two humbuckers (covers removed), providing what he described as a Gibson that could sound like a Tele whenever he wanted.", 'Alvin began fixing stickers to the body of the guitar he called Big Red, including a nuclear disarmament "peace" symbol, added at the Fillmore West in San Francisco earlier in 1969. The sight and sound of Alvin and decorated 335 blasting his quartet through a ten-minute "I\'m Going Home" in the Woodstock movie (released early in 1970) did wonders for TYA\'s already growing popularity.', "Jorma Kaukonen with the Airplane and Buzzy Feiten with Paul Butterfield each used a 345, and 18-year-old Henry Gross played one, too, with Sha Na Na on Monday—at the decidedly un-musicianly hour of 7:30 am, thanks to the festival's wildly over-running schedule. He'd made attempts to try to improve the guitar, which he never quite got on with. He'd bought it new at Manny's in New York City in 1965, after it became clear that his first choice, a double-bound Rick 360/12, would take too long to arrive.", '"My 345 never played good," Henry tells me, "and so I had it with Dan Armstrong at his shop, had the frets dressed down to like a fretless wonder, and then I had them re-fret it. But there was nothing they could do. The thing was, though, the little fucker sounded amazing. Isn\'t it always the way? The neck was twisted in a way that could not be fixed. But the sound of the pickups in that guitar—gee whiz, man! It sounded like the fattest Tele in the world. It was just great with that Varitone."', 'Henry had bumped into Jimi Hendrix years before Woodstock, through a school acquaintance, Velvert Turner. Later, Sha Na Na got together as a sort of \'50s retro act—"like a glee club prank," according to Henry—and they played at Steve Paul\'s The Scene club in New York City. Jimi came down to see them, and Henry found himself chatting to him in one of the club\'s tiny dressing rooms.', '"He had his guitar case, because everybody would jam there till five, six in the morning after the show," Henry remembers. "We started talking. Now, what is the question you ask a guitar player that would stop you being friends and put you into the category of get-this-geek-away-from-me? Well, I did it. We\'d talked for 15 minutes or so, and I said, \'Jimi, what kind of guitar strings do you use?\' Believe it or not—and this was how Jimi was—he opened his case and gave me all of the strings in there, every last one he had. I\'d got away with it! He hadn\'t sensed that there was anything wrong with asking him. And I still have those Dan Armstrong Superstrings, .008s on top."', "Henry reckons that Jimi helped Sha Na Na get the Woodstock gig, and they were last-minute additions to the bill. Following a long drive from Manhattan and an encounter with Jimi's hooch and Jerry Garcia's sensimilla, Henry made it to the stage and played the Sha Na Na set. Their early morning slot took its toll.", '"We were just exhausted. We were up for over a day. Let\'s just say our band musically was a bit challenged. Even for us, that was a bad gig." It didn\'t stop him performing some impressive rollovers with his 345 when they tore into "Wipe Out," with Jimi looking on from the side. "Not long after Woodstock, I left the band. There were many reasons, but the biggest one, probably, was that I watched Jimi Hendrix that day. He went on after us, he did \'The Star-Spangled Banner\' and all the rest, and I thought man, this guy\'s making music only he can make. I\'ve got to do that. That\'s the cleanest way to say how I got out of the band. There was no bad feeling or anything, it just wasn\'t for me any more."', "One of the more unusual Gibsons featured at Woodstock was a Florentine-cut Byrdland played by Freddie Stone with Sly & The Family Stone. This was a rare showing for a single-cut hollowbody Gibson at the festival, but the '60s example that he used nonetheless seemed perfect for Freddie's super-funky grooves.", "Crosby, Stills & Nash played very early on Monday morning, first as an acoustic trio, and then as an electric band with the addition of Neil Young, Greg Reeves, and Dallas Taylor. There's not much visual evidence to help identify exactly what guitars they played, but they certainly helped boost Martin's score in our survey.", "Other Martin users at Woodstock included Joan Baez playing her small-body 1929 0-45, and Robbie Robertson, playing an early-'50s D-28.", 'David Crosby played a D-18 for most of the acoustic set, a guitar that rather ambitiously had been converted to a 12-string, and Stephen Stills used what looked like a D-45. Graham Nash did play his Epiphone Texan on "Marrakesh Express," a guitar that for some time had worn a black refinish and fancy twin pickguards, but to tie in with Woodstock\'s 50th anniversary, Graham recently sold his 1969 D-45 at auction for $162,500, which he says was one of three the band had bought and taken to the festival.', 'For CSNY\'s electric set, Neil Young was absent from most photos and footage, but one short glimpse at the close of "Long Time Gone" showed him with a Gretsch 6120. David Crosby played an unusual custom thinline hollowbody electric 12-string. It had a single rounded cutaway and a very custom-looking neck. There\'s a possibility the body was from a Guild Duane Eddy that Stephen once had.', "Another custom guitar on view was a Guild Studio 402 that Bob Weir used during Grateful Dead's performance. Bob's 402 had fancier appointments than the regular model and non-standard controls ranged around the body edge, seemingly marking it out as a Guild special order. It's possible, though, that the work may have been done for Bob by Alembic, which had just started to assist the Dead in developing and modifying their instruments and equipment. None of this helped the Dead's below-par performance at Woodstock, hampered by delays when their gear derailed one of the wheeled pallets used to move gear around the stage.", 'Other Guild players at Woodstock, acoustic and electric, included Tom Fogerty and the Bert Sommer/Ira Stone duo. Most striking of the acoustic Guild guitarists was Richie Havens, who opened the festival around 5:00 pm Friday evening.', "His Guild D-40, tuned to open D, was a sturdy instrument—which was just as well given the pummeling it received. Richie's percussive style was a revelation and must have sold many Guild guitars following his startling performances in the 1970 Woodstock movie.", 'Around 9:00 am Monday morning, Jimi Hendrix took to the stage with Gypsy Sun & Rainbows ("for short, it\'s nothing but a band of gypsies," he explained) as some of the audience began to drift away. School, college, jobs, and households beckoned, even for hippies. Jimi played his \'68 maple-board Olympic White Strat, putting him among a small number of fellow Woodstock performers who brought a Fender with them.', "Other Fender-wielding guitarists at Woodstock included Miller Anderson, who we've already met with his Telecaster. Robbie Robertson of The Band was a distinctive Fender freak, a masterful minimalist who favored Teles for his electric work throughout the '60s until he shifted allegiance to Strats in the mid-'70s.", 'Harvey Mandel often favored a 335, but for stage work with Canned Heat, as at Woodstock, he usually opted for a Strat, a guitar less likely to trouble him with unwanted feedback. Johnny Winter used a Fender Electric XII for part of his set, although he chose to use it set up as a six-string.', 'In our rough survey of the guitars put to use at the festival, there are a few outliers beyond the Gibsons and Martins and Guilds and Fenders. John Fogerty played a Rickenbacker 325 (in addition to his Les Paul Custom) with Creedence on Saturday, and early the next morning Paul Kantner used his Rick 360/12 with Jefferson Airplane.', '"I was fond of not having my 12-string rhythm guitar way out front like a lot of 12-string electric players do, particularly lead players," Paul told me. "I was more content with creating a nice thick sound in combination with the bass and Nicky Hopkins\' piano. I liked the combination of the low-end of the 12-string and those instruments, and I strived to make a combination of elements rather than a solo kind of situation."', 'Melanie strummed a nylon-string Goya G-30 on the largely acoustic Friday bill, and Tim Hardin played a Harmony Sovereign flattop, which the following day he lent to John Sebastian, who played an unannounced solo interlude between Santana and Keef Hartley. Another borrowed acoustic was the Yamaha FG-150 that someone dug out for Country Joe McDonald to support his rousing "I-Feel-Like-I\'m-Fixin\'-To-Die" performance around Saturday lunchtime.', 'The Incredible String Band brought a couple of flattop acoustics with them from Britain to the stage on Saturday evening. Robin Williamson played a dreadnought-shape Levin Super Goliath, made in Sweden. Robin had painted the top with colorful scenes and patterns, and the headstock had an unusual V-shape addition. Mike Heron used a smaller-body acoustic, custom made for him by the UK maker John Bailey.', 'Another rare acoustic seen at the festival was played by Arlo Guthrie. His main guitars at the time were a Martin D-18 and a couple of Candelas flattops made by the Delgado family in Los Angeles, a six-string and a 12-string. At Woodstock, the film evidence implies Arlo mainly played the Candelas 12.', '"When people ask me about Woodstock now," Henry Gross says, "the easy answer is, \'Oh yes, all the lads got in the cars and drove there and played the show, and oh boy, we met all the pop stars, and wasn\'t it great!\' Isn\'t that just a nice story? I\'m always the miserable guy who has to tell the truth. The truth was, it was a business. It wasn\'t all about something else."', '"Fifty years later," he continues, "and the guy still has no deal 30 days before the show. Fifty years later! Do you think that there may be a pattern there? We\'ve had 50 years to see if we could do this. These days, people are congratulated for how much money they made from an event, rather than for what their cultural contribution was." And were you paid for playing at Woodstock, Henry? "No, we were paid $300—this was for a 12-piece group—and the check bounced."', '"The whole festival, really, was a bit of a mess," Miller Anderson reckons. "I think the only person who\'s been totally honest about that is Pete Townshend—somebody asked him about it, and he said it was a fucking mess. And it was. You couldn\'t really blame the organizers, or the promoters, because they weren\'t expecting that amount of people, and they weren\'t ready for it."', 'Maybe it just, like, happened, man? "Yes, it was just one of those flukes that happened," Miller agrees. "So, having played at Woodstock, for quite a number of years I didn\'t feel I played that great, what with that amp I didn\'t know how to work. But years later, I met Walter Trout at a festival we were both playing on. I was surprised that he even knew me. He said, \'I was at Woodstock, Mill.\' I told him he was too young.', '"He said, \'I was 15, rolling around in the mud at the front of the stage.\' A member of the audience! He said it was sad that The Keef Hartley Band didn\'t get on the film or album, because he thought we were one of the best bands there. And that he wasn\'t just saying that because I was standing in front of him. Anyway, for years I\'d looked back on it and thought, Ah, Woodstock—what a mess! But slowly and surely I\'ve started to realize that it was probably a real part of history, you know?"', "New to Reverb? Sign up for free to join the world's best marketplace for music gear.

They were built by his then-guitar tech, Peter Cook, who had struck out on his own and was making basses under the Ned Callan name in his workroom in Ealing, west London. Later, they were manufactured in some volume for him by Shergold—which also made for Burns and others—and these were sold under the Shaftesbury Ned Callan brand.', 'Entwistle called one of his handmade Ned Callan basses "Peter Cook\'s Jigsaw Puzzle." Others included several hybrid "Explorer Birds," with Gibson Explorer-like bodies and maple Precision necks. One went for £12,000 when the Entwistle collection was sold at Sotheby\'s in 2004. There was the Lightning Bolt, as illustrated on the Who By Numbers sleeve, and the custom Flame Bass, which Entwistle sold at auction for $33,000 in 1988 (and Christie\'s sold for $44,880 by in 2010).', "Cook was also an accomplished repairman and worked on instruments for Pete Townshend, The Damned, Motörhead, Whitesnake, and others. The basses he made for Entwistle may not have added much in the way of electronics or unorthodox materials, but he showed that you didn't have to produce Precision clones to make a statement. His name is still above the door of the guitar shop in Ealing that he founded in 1981, although he has not been involved in the business for 30 years.", 'Shergold is a name that will appear regularly in this article, and eagle-eyed bass fans will detect a family resemblance between several instruments here. You might call it a distinctive, utilitarian chunkiness, as in the Ned Callan models—and also in the angularity of a Wal bass. There is a reason for that: Pete Stevens had worked for Shergold.', "In 1974, Stevens joined Wal's founder, Ian Waller, an ex-pro bass player turned luthier and electronics wiz, to form Electric Wood. Their Wal basses were an instant hit among London's studio bassists, early adopters including John Gustafson (Roxy Music, etc.) and John G. Perry (Caravan, etc.).", "Wals had bolt-on necks and plainer styling than Alembics or Jaydees. But they offered eight-coil humbuckers, advanced electronics, sturdy hardware, and were much-admired for playability and tone. Users of the first series included John Entwistle, Percy Jones (Brand X), and Gary Tibbs (Adam and the Ants). The Pro series, launched in the mid-'80s, saw the end of Wal's distinctive leather pickguards but added advanced filter options. Five- and six-string Wals appeared later, with exotic body wood choices.", 'The extensive list of Wal users includes Paul McCartney, Geddy Lee (Rush), and Justin Chancellor (Tool).', "Wal founder Ian Waller died in 1988, and Pete Stevens continued with the business, later offering a MIDI bass. Stevens died in 2011, but Paul Herman, who worked with Wal in the '70s and '90s, had by then taken over, and he still produces Wal basses today, exporting them globally.", 'Follow this brand', 'John Diggins is well-known for guitars as well as basses, his users having included Tony Iommi, Angus Young, and Roy Orbison. Jaydee basses, recognizable partly thanks to a distinctive headstock design and wooden pickup covers, have remained popular to the present day. Diggins started out with the Birmingham maker John Birch. Birch was a pickup specialist, and Diggins did much of the woodwork, building his reputation with guitars for Iommi, Manny Charlton (Nazareth) and, most famously in Britain, Dave Hill (Slade).', "Diggins left John Birch in 1977 and set up on his own. His first bass was for studio player Richard Ford (Bill Nelson, etc.) who wanted a piano-like tone with extended sustain. Diggins drew a somewhat Alembic-influenced design on the back of a wallpaper roll and was so impressed with the resulting instrument's tone and sustain that he decided to make more.", "Distinctive features included round brass string anchors and wooden pickup covers, which Diggins says came about almost by chance. Searching for something other than traditional metal, he glued together strips of offcuts of the exotic woods he used and liked the result. He hadn't anticipated that for players like Mark King (Level 42), a master of slapping, wooden covers worked better than metal, which tended to ring when the strings slapped against them. Wood added a percussive sound, which was just what King and other players in this style wanted.", 'Diggins, in semi-retirement today, handed the everyday business to his sons Michael and Andrew. The line now has a distinctive family style, active or passive, using Jaydee\'s own pickups and circuitry, multiple laminated walnut and maple through-necks and bodies, with laminated center-body sections and a choice of exotic woods for the outriggers. The exceptions are the simpler Roadies, which have mahogany necks and bodies. Diggins himself says he spends most of his time "in the backroom" working on new ideas, the latest of which is an innovative truss-rod system.', 'Follow this brand', 'Soundwave, based in Essex, south-east England, gave birth not just to Trace Elliot, which became a pioneering bass amp brand, but also Rob Green\'s Status Graphite basses, which remain in high demand today. Green began working on Shergolds and found himself handling repairs in Soundwave\'s "back room" as the company developed PA equipment. They soon noticed bass players, too, were interested in the potential of PA-style gear, and searched for an equally advanced bass with which to demonstrate it.', 'By the early \'80s, Ned Steinberger\'s minimalist all-synthetic headless basses had won acclaim, and Soundwave were early advocates. Wanting their own bass guitar brand, they encouraged Green to produce an advanced design, and in 1981 Status Graphite was born, marrying old and new technology. His original Status featured a headless graphite neck and a phenolic fingerboard, but with an exotic wood body. Still available today, it now comes in many varieties: headless or headed, with fingerboard LEDs, all-graphite bodies or endless wood choices, EQ configurations, and even an optional "chameleon" lacquer that changes color depending on the light.', 'Mark King was an early Status enthusiast, and his signature KingBass, launched in 2001, is still available, though now with headstock and five strings, and the most advanced King is the Parametric. The company also offers an all-graphite model named for a Chris Wolstenholme (Muse), and another prominent user is Alex "V-Man" Venturella (Slipknot), who has a signature bass on the way. Rob Green and a team of six still work from a small factory in Essex and offer a bewildering range of options beyond the standard series, which itself comprises 11 basic types.', 'Follow this brand', "Chris May is another UK bass specialist who founded his business in the '70s. He'd worked as a guitar repairer, and first set up in London's famous Denmark Street, later relocating north, initially to Newcastle, later to Alston, and currently in Carlisle, near the border with Scotland.", 'Overwater only offers basses (though it has made guitars in the past) and has carved out a niche with top-end professionals, notably session bassists. Overwaters can be found with a number of theater, broadcast, and recording bassists, users including Mo Foster, Paul Geary, Phil Mulford, Andy Pask, and Phil Mann (UK) and Mary Anne McSweeney, Jim Donica, Carlos Hidalgo, and Bill Kratz (USA), plus much exposure thanks to YouTube bass teacher Scott Devine, who has a signature Overwater model.', "In the early '80s, Overwater developed its own active electronics, designed by Bruce Keir (who worked later at Marshall and Blackstar). An innovation was the C Bass, introduced in the early '80s when Andrew Bodnar (Thompson Twins) told May he needed to play lower than the bottom E of a four-string bass. Enter the 36-inch-scale C Bass, developed to meet this need and an instant success. Before long, five and six-string bases supplanted the C Bass.", "Overwater does offer a full custom-making service, but the main lines are fairly conservatively styled instruments, with a hybrid P- and J-style inspired by Carlos Henriquez. May says many of his designs come about like that, when highly technical players look for something unavailable off the shelf. Also, Overwater is one of the few custom makers to offer semi-acoustic (Expression) and hollow basses (Hollowbody). Overwaters have appealed especially to jazz and session artists rather than the hard rock fraternity—a thinking player's bass, maybe?", 'Follow this brand', 'About the author: Gary Cooper is a journalist working in the musical instrument and pro audio fields.

Perhaps this is simply to say that they are both extremely versatile and popular amplifiers.', 'The circuit and overall design behind each of these club-sized classics is quite different, however, and they have different sonic signatures as a result. On one hand, sure—either one might work just fine for your music. But if you want to know which excels at the kind of tone and feel that will help your playing soar, you need to dig a little deeper.', 'Prior to diving into the real differences between these two combos, it’s important to note that the specs and configurations of the Vox AC15 have varied a lot more over the years than the Fender Deluxe Reverb’s specs and configurations. This begs the question, "The Deluxe Reverb vs. which AC15?"', "Vintage AC15s from 1958 into the late '60s were made with an EF86 pentode preamp tube. Vox’s original handwired reissue from circa 2007—the AC15H1 TV—were made with these preamp tubes as well. This tube adds a somewhat thicker, creamier texture to the amp’s overall character when compared with the more common 12AX7 preamp tube used in the current renditions and in the popular English-made AC15TB of the 1990s.", 'That being said, the current models still have much in common with their different predecessors. They display several similar sonic characteristics—many of which make any rendition of an AC15 quite different from a Deluxe Reverb—so it’s still easy to differentiate these two classic combos from opposite sides of the pond.', 'The Deluxe Reverb has duly earned its massive popularity over the five-plus decades since its arrival by offering everything that many guitarists need to play a wide variety of music in an easy package.', "After the tweed Deluxe of the '50s and the tan-Tolex rendition of 1961-'63, the Deluxe Reverb arrived as the club-sized cornerstone of Fender’s blackface lineup in late '63 or early '64 (histories often claim a '63 origin, though it’s hard to find existing examples from that year).", 'In addition to the amp’s updated cosmetics, Fender introduced a circuit that provided more control over the amp’s EQ—sandwiching bass and treble controls between two gain stages from one 12AX7 tube per channel—as well as other tweaks that helped derive more headroom from this 22-watt amp.', 'High voltage supplies and a fixed-bias output stage with a negative feedback loop squeezed maximum power from the 6V6GT output tubes, eliciting a clear and punchy response.', 'The Deluxe Reverb’s respectable headroom at lower volumes and its general preamp configuration also make it a great foundation for most overdrive pedals. Many Tube Screamer-types are a match made in heaven with this amp, as these amps characteristically have a shy midrange that Tube Screamers fill in.', 'Despite the Deluxe Reverb being good at so much, there are certainly several things that it simply isn’t cut out for. While you might be able to get a faux-Plexi tone out of it with one of the many popular "Marshall-in-a-box" overdrive pedals available, it really doesn’t achieve anything close to those lauded Plexi crunch and lead tones on its own. Also, players who live in the amp-overdrive zone sometimes find its breed of tube distortion overly stinging or a bit "ice-pick-y."', 'Of course, any amp this size will have its volume limits. The Deluxe Reverb might not be enough on its own to fill many big-arena stages, though many players find its 22-watts surprisingly loud. And since most big stages these days mic amps and feed them through the monitors, the Deluxe Reverb is probably more versatile now than ever before.', 'The Vox AC15 was designed by Dick Denney in 1958 for Jennings Musical Instruments (JMI). It is often described as being the first guitar amplifier created specifically with the guitar’s frequency range in mind, rather than merely being adapted from existing tube-amplification circuits.', 'Regardless, this is an amplifier that segues beautifully from shimmering cleans to toothsome overdrive, and original examples are among the most-prized vintage amps on the collector’s market today.', 'Among the distinguishing factors of the AC15 design are its cathode-biased output stage with no negative feedback, generating around 15-watts from a pair of EL84 output tubes. As discussed above, the original AC15 and the first handwired reissue (the AC15H1 TV) had an EF86 tube in the preamp; if you’re considering one of those, substitute a little more thickness, creaminess, and fatness into the sound picture painted here versus the added sparkle of the 12AX7-loaded version with a Top Boost EQ stage—also found in the equally legendary AC30.', 'Although 15-watts might not sound like much, it really doesn’t yield an appreciably different volume than the Deluxe Reverb’s 22 watts. What the AC15 does give you at this level is a more natural-feeling segue from clean to overdrive when you hit the strings hard, and a slightly looser (but still appealing) low-end due to that cathode-biased output stage with no negative feedback.', 'Some players feel the AC15 isn’t quite as good a pedal platform as other firmer-toned amps its size, and it’s often true that certain overdrives will push these amps’ front ends just a little too hard. The mid-heavy voicing of Tube Screamer-type ODs, for example, can elicit too much midrange mud from an AC15, which already has plenty going on in that frequency band.', 'Also, some other overdrives and fuzz pedals don’t play nice with the amp’s Top Boost tone stage, inducing harsh highs in particular. Well-balanced overdrives and booster pedals can often help nudge an AC15 into tasty lead-guitar goodness, though. If 15-watts doesn’t seem all that powerful, the amp’s frequency content—and its high saturation of harmonic overtones in particular—can often make it sound surprisingly loud to the ear.', 'Ultimately, this is a legendary little tone machine that really suits players who want a lot of character in their mild-breakup or cranked-vintage-overdrive tones.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

What follows is the story of the humble BD–2 and some usable examples of how this Boss classic can sound fresh on any pedalboard.', 'By March of 1995, Pearl Jam’s “Better Man” off Vitology had been sitting comfortably at No. 1 on the Billboard rock charts for a solid seven weeks. That same month, the Boss BD–2 Blues Driver first hit guitar store shelves, targeting a different sort of player.', 'While grunge was going strong, the powers that be at Boss realized that blues music was about to make a comeback. For most of 1995, albums by Eric Clapton, Jeff Healey, and Stevie Ray Vaughan dominated the blues charts for longer runs than many grunge albums on the respective rock charts.', 'The strategic release of the BD–2 meant that fans of the new blues craze could emulate those tones on records by the greats with the help of an economical, accessible Boss pedal.', 'The Blues Driver not only quickly captured its targeted audience, but its versatility and character helped it to transcend genres equally as hastily. That wider use also colluded with a growing pedal mod movement, as the BD–2 was a prime candidate for tweaking due to its affordable price and solid tone.', 'Enter Robert Keeley. Starting in the early 2000s, Keeley developed what is arguably one of the most famous and sought–after mods to any guitar pedal, referred to simply as the Keeley Mod.', 'With this mod, Keeley upgraded all of the components for a warmer, cleaner tone. He also offered an optional “Phat mod,” adding a small toggle switch under the gain knob that provided players with two levels of bass response.', 'One mode produces a tight and clean tone, while the other sounds “phat” and boosted. Aspects of this same design eventually resulted in the popular Keeley Katana Blues Drive.', 'Given Boss’s past success with and continued demand for the BD–2, it was a natural choice for inclusion in the company’s new line–up of premiere pedal designs under the Boss Waza Craft banner.', 'Under the hood, the new BD–2W includes an all–analog circuit that both retains and refines the distinctive responsiveness and clarity of the original. On the enclosure, however, a tiny switch toggles between classic and custom modes — the latter giving the original tone fuller body and deeper sustain.', 'The latest chapter in the BD–2 history was written by its most hailed modder. After 15 years of tinkering with the original pedal, Robert Keeley released the Super Phat Mod Full Range Overdrive.', 'The Super Phat Mod is inspired by the original BD–2 sound, came with the expected gain, level, and drive knobs, as well as a flat to phat toggle that fully integrated the notorious bass boost of Keeley’s original mod.', 'So that’s the story so far. But with the list of countless contenders of innovative overdrive pedals on the market, is there any good reason to pick up the discontinued original?', 'As the throngs of BD–2 faithful will attest, the pedal’s overdrive architecture shines when hit with varying dynamics, attack intensities, and playing styles. And with the twist of a knob, it pivots from a subtle, tasteful overdrive to an edgy, grinding one. Those are the basics.', 'But beyond those conventional uses, the BD–2 proves incredibly versatile when partnered up with other gear. Those interactions are how it still has some tricks up its sleeve after two decades in rotation.', 'Everyone has their favorite stompbox that adds a little pixie dust to any setup, yet few fully–featured overdrive pedals find themselves in that category. When the drive knob is dialed all the way down with the tone and level set to taste, the BD–2 can enhance the clarity and precision of your clean sound.', 'That means that the BD–2 can perfectly prime your clean tone for the rest of your effects chain, making it easy for that clean guitar to cut through. There’s a good chance that once you use it to sculpt your cleans, the BD–2’s LED will be on perma–glow.', 'You can also use the BD–2 to get more out of you amp’s natural breakup. We all love that sweet spot on an amp where the circuit and tubes are pushed right to the point where crisp cleans crumble into natural drive. That tone, however, is also delicate and easy to inundate.', 'Here is where the trifecta of gain, level, and tone knobs on the BD–2 proves genius despite its simplicity. By experimenting with a light dose of gain and adding increments of tone and level, you can get an even sweeter sweet spot than your amp would achieve on its own.', 'But the tastiest use of the BD–2 might be as a Centaur slayer, helping your guitar cut through your band’s mix at critical moments.', 'One configuration where the modded BD–2 or Super Phat Mod excel most is when used as a boost pedal set before another favorite overdrive. Not unlike the fabled Klon Centaur and its Klone army, the BD–2 gracefully nudges the level of other overdrive pedals without cluttering your sound.', 'A pedal doesn’t stay in active production or inspire countless modded versions for more than two decades without good reason. People use a variety of buzzwords when talking about the BD–2: always–on, responsive, transparent. But the BD–2 has been at it since before those buzzwords were popularized by the internet, so let’s just call the BD–2 a plain old Boss.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. Yoshiki "Joe" Hoshino was the boss at Hoshino USA, the American arm of Ibanez\'s Japanese parent company. The firm\'s top people joined him around the table, including president Mitsuaki "Mike" Shamada, and Rich Lasner and Bill Reim, who worked on designs, marketing, and pretty much anything else that needed doing.', 'Ibanez had problems. The guitar of the moment was the superstrat, with the Kramer brand well in the lead, assisted in no small measure by the endorsement from the superstar guitarist Eddie Van Halen. Ibanez was trying to join the superstrat club, without success. Business was poor, despite useful allegiances and signature models with Bob Weir, Steve Lukather, Allan Holdsworth, and others—each a fine guitarist, but not exactly a headline extreme rocker.', 'Joe declared that Ibanez must find its very own Eddie Van Halen. He put a question to the meeting. "Is there anybody out there who could work with us and represent the company and make a big impact on the market?" Everyone answered more or less in unison: "Well, yes—it has to be Steve Vai!"', 'Joe was impressed with the single-minded response and told them to go find this Steve Vai, talk with him, and do whatever they had to do to get him to work with Ibanez.', "Steve Vai was a growing force, a guitarist with enviable musical and technical powers. He used vibrato dives, fast-picking flurries, tapping, noises, feedback, and a generous touch of showmanship. His break had come at the start of the '80s when, just 20 years old, he had joined Frank Zappa's elite touring band. His first solo album, Flex-Able, appeared in 1984, the same year he replaced Yngwie Malmsteen in Alcatrazz.", "Toward the end of '85, he hit the big time, joining the ex-Van Halen vocalist David Lee Roth in a new supergroup alongside bassist Billy Sheehan and drummer Gregg Bissonette. His previous employer, Frank Zappa, said that Steve did everything that Eddie Van Halen ever dreamed of, and then some.", 'At Ibanez, meanwhile, the meeting broke up, and the mission to attract Steve Vai was underway.', 'Steve had learned an important lesson when he played with Frank Zappa. "I realized that I didn\'t have to be limited to the guitars that people are making and selling in stores," he recalls, adding that Frank would take a guitar—or any piece of gear—and squeeze it until it screamed for mercy. "Then he\'d call the company and say, \'OK, but can you do this to it so I can make it do this, this, and this?\' He\'d do that with any kind of pedal, guitar, musical notation—anything. Frank was this fountain of creativity in all aspects. And it was always done with a joke, too."', "Soon, Steve was poking and coaxing his own guitars. He'd joined Frank's band with a natural '76 Strat, a guitar he loved for its vibrato but hated for its sound. Now he wanted more frets than the Strat had, he wanted one of those new locking vibratos, and he wanted humbuckers. When he joined Alcatrazz in '84, he visited Grover Jackson in San Dimas, who gave him a Charvel shaped like a Strat but with humbuckers.", '"For me it was like glory day," he tells me. "This is what I wanted—but there were still so many things about the guitar that I thought I wanted changed."', 'This Charvel Strat-style guitar, the "Green Meanie," became Steve\'s testbed and main working guitar. He added a single-coil in the middle of the two humbuckers, modding the five-way to give two in-betweens as well as three main settings of each pickup alone. He wanted the vibrato to pull up higher than a regular system. The problem was the body behind the bridge, he figured, so he had his guitar tech, Elwood Francis, gouge out the wood there with a rattail file. One of the first pieces to benefit from the new vibrato range was "The Attitude Song" on Flex-Able.', "Soon after Steve joined David Lee Roth's new post-Van Halen band, they spent the early months of 1986 recording a debut album and played their first gigs in August, starting a US tour that ran more or less nonstop until February '87.", 'He took nine guitars on that tour: the Charvel Green Meanie was his main squeeze, plus a Tom Anderson Custom, a yellow Jackson Custom Soloist, two custom guitars made by Steve\'s friend Joe Despagni—the Flame and the Lightning Bolt—and four Performance guitars put together from parts made by Kunio "Kenny" Sugai at Performance Guitar in Hollywood.', "Rich Lasner from Ibanez arranged to take a guitar to Steve at a show in Buffalo, New York, at the end of September '86. It was a prototype Ibanez Maxxas, which he thought might be different enough to create some interest. Before the band's soundcheck, Steve plugged the guitar into his amps, whereupon the semi-hollow body of the Maxxas fed back like crazy. Back to the drawing board.", 'Perhaps a solidbody Maxxas might work? Toward the end of \'86, Ibanez had one ready, and someone found a number for Steve\'s parents on Long Island. Rich made the call. He told them he wanted to get a new guitar to their son. "I said we don\'t want to impinge on your family," Rich tells me. "But would it be possible if we sent a guitar wrapped as a Christmas present, and you put it under the tree, and it\'s just from us?"', 'Rich came off the phone with everyone happy. "We had a solidbody Maxxas," he says, "painted it pink, green, and white snakeskin, wrapped it in some really jolly Christmas stuff, and FedEx\'d it over to their house."', 'The day after Christmas, Steve called Rich. "OK," he said, "you got my attention—what do you want?" Rich told him they really wanted to do a guitar together. Steve relented. "All right," he said, "how about we try something?"', "With the long Roth tour finally over in February '87, Steve considered his road-worn gear. The Charvel had taken a battering. Its vibrato mounting collapsed during soundcheck at a prestigious date at Madison Square Garden, and at another gig it went silent. On the last date of the tour, the Performance Playboy got broken onstage, and Steve—with keen assistance from bassist Billy Sheehan—enjoyed completing the deconstruction backstage.", 'Steve contacted Ibanez and said he was interested in their gadget-of-the-moment, the SDR1000 stereo digital delay. Rich saw this as an opportunity to fly out and take him a couple of SDRs—and talk guitars.', "Steve explained he had a bunch of guitars where he loved the body on one, the neck on another, the frets on this one, the pickups on that—but he wasn't one-hundred percent happy with any single guitar he had. Rich suggested Steve make notes on each of the guitars that had something he absolutely loved, send them to Ibanez HQ, and they would build him something that combined all the ideas.", 'A week later, the guitars showed up. As far as anyone remembers, there was at least a Tom Anderson, a Charvel, and a Performance, and they had Steve\'s notes stuck to them, as requested: "This neck feels great" and so on. He liked the neck on the Anderson, Rich recalls, and the scoop for the left-hand at the cutaway on the Charvel, while the Performance had the body handle he wanted to incorporate.', '"Once I joined Dave Roth," Steve recalls, "and that Eat \'Em And Smile record came out, and the Crossroads movie came out—well, as you can imagine, all the guitar companies were very eager for me to use their instruments. You can\'t buy the kind of advertising in a magazine that you can get when a star artist is using your gear. So they were all calling me."', 'He recalls sending specs and pictures to five or six companies who also offered to make him something, including Yamaha, and also Kramer, who seemed more interested in wining, dining, and rides in the limo. Back came the guitars—eventually. And they had very little to do with what he had asked for.', '"Ibanez, however, took just three weeks and gave me a guitar that was exactly what I wanted," he says. "In fact, it was better than what I wanted."', 'Ibanez had its own reasons to be so quick. Rich Lasner and Bill Reim knew they might be able to launch a Steve Vai signature model at the forthcoming summer NAMM show, just months away. Steve seemed to be exactly the personification of the brand they had in mind. With business still in the doldrums, Ibanez needed a new and exciting guitar sooner rather than later.', 'Rich took two JEM prototypes to show Steve. He pulled out the first one, and Steve did not play it. Instead, he took it apart.', '"Steve said relax, I do this to every guitar I have," Rich recalls. "He explained that he really wanted to know how the guitar worked. He put it back together, and he said: \'You know, this is a damned good guitar.\' He said it was really well done. He checked out the second guitar and he liked that, too. So we left one with him, and we took one back to the shop. Those guitars were essentially 90 percent of what the production guitars became. Most of what was missing was cosmetic."', "That imminent NAMM show in '87 would mark 30 years since Ibanez's first electric guitars—not that anyone would have noticed at the time. The brand was owned by the Hoshino company of Japan, which began when Matsujirou Hoshino opened a bookshop in Nagoya. He added a musical instruments section in 1908.", 'Twenty years later, after a tour by the great Spanish classical guitarist Andrés Segovia, Hoshino began importing classical guitars from Salvador Ibáñez in Valencia. When that workshop was destroyed in the Spanish Civil War at the end of the \'30s, Hoshino kept the name, making acoustic guitars in Japan. At first these were branded "Ibanez Salvador" and soon simply "Ibanez."', 'Aside from those and a few other early efforts, Hoshino has never built instruments. The first electrics appeared around 1957, and from 1970 or so, most were made by the Fujigen factory in Matsumoto, which became a valuable partner for Ibanez. Hoshino set up a US operation in 1972, at first known as Elger. This provided not only a sales HQ at the heart of the biggest guitar market in the world, but also invaluable feedback about the kinds of instruments that American guitarists wanted to play.', "Copies began in the '60s, and Maurice Summerfield, the original UK distributor for Hoshino's instruments, provided valuable information to the Japanese. He recommended they add to the line a copy of the Gibson Flying V, the old model recently given a low-key revival by Gibson. Summerfield bought a Flying V and sent it off to Japan, and soon Ibanez was making a copy, followed by one of a Gibson double-neck.", "By 1976, the brand was offering two dozen different Les Paul–style models, among many other copies, but also it had begun to experiment with original designs, including a few double-cutaway solidbody models, starting in '73, and the angular Iceman, launched in '75.", 'Gibson registered a headstock trademark in 1975 and warned Ibanez—which had already started to use another style of headstock. Two years later, Gibson filed a complaint in court, claiming infringement of its trademark. Ibanez agreed to stop infringing Gibson\'s trademarked headstock design—which it had already done. An out-of-court settlement closed Gibson\'s complaint in February 1978. This was the origin of the now carelessly applied term "lawsuit era."', "By the early '80s, Ibanez was struggling to make a mark. Its focus now was entirely on new designs rather than copies, including two George Benson jazz guitars, introduced in 1977, plus a year later the Alembic-influenced Musician and Studio guitars, and some elegant carved-body models in the Artist and Professional series. But none of those could match the impact that a Steve Vai model, now in finished prototype form, might make in the valuable mainstream rock market.", "The summer '87 NAMM show took place in Chicago, running from June 27–30, and the Ibanez booth was buzzing with excitement. What were they hiding under that big black shroud watched over by a security guard? At last the moment arrived when all would be revealed. It was the talk of the show, and the booth was packed.", 'Rich Lasner was beside the big monolith, which was still covered up. "You could see all the guys from Kramer," he says, "who had been pretty much kicking our ass for the last couple of years with Van Halen. They were standing there with their arms folded, wondering what on earth\'s going on. We dropped the black cloth, and there\'s a giant poster of Steve Vai playing the JEM. Everybody applauds. I look over at the Kramer guys. Their jaws are on the floor, and then they\'re walking away. That to me was a moment of, like, Wow! We actually may have done this. You know? We did something here."', 'The JEM had a unique combination of features, and it looked nothing like any other electric guitar. The body came in one of three striking fluorescent colors, with matching headstock and colorful contrasting pickups and controls. The basswood body itself had an extended Strat shape, with squared sides, pointy horns, and a Monkey Grip handle-hole.', "The Monkey Grip name was borrowed from horse riding, where a monkey is a handle clipped to a saddle so the rider can hang on when the going gets tough. Steve used his for stage antics, whirling the guitar around and hanging on to the handle. He also figured it gave the guitar a unique look, although a few '60s Guyatones and Teiscos had featured something similar.", "Ibanez's Edge locking vibrato system had Lion's Claw furrows behind the bridge, which added some extra pull-up space. DiMarzio colorful pickups were in humbucker/single-coil/humbucker formation, an early occurrence on a production guitar, and Steve got his favored single-coil in-between settings thanks to Steve Blucher at DiMarzio, who provided the five-way circuit. [Ed: An earlier version of this paragraph stated the JEM's HSH formation was the first in a production guitar. See the comments section below for more detail.]", "The maple neck was more or less Ibanez's thin Ultra style, with a little more chunk and a cutaway neck heel. There was a maple fingerboard featuring distinctive-colored Disappearing Pyramid inlays, a 25.5-inch scale, and 24 frets, scalloped from the 21st upward, inspired by Billy Sheehan's Yamaha basses and a guitar Yngwie Malmsteen had showed Steve.", "The JEMs debuted in 1987 in three color variations: the limited-run JEM777LG in Loch Ness Green at $1,590, with the regular JEM777, in Desert Sun Yellow or Shocking Pink, at $1,299. They weren't exactly cheap. A Gibson Les Paul Standard listed at a touch over $1,000 in 1987, a Fender American Standard Stratocaster at $650. The JEMs weren't just distinctive; they had an upscale vibe and a price to make you stop and think.", 'Nonetheless, all 777 of the limited-edition green model sold out quickly. "They were gone immediately," Rich says with a smile. "The JEM was a wild success from the very first day of sale. Amazing, really."', 'Ibanez had another trick up its sleeve. Also released that summer was the new RG550 model. Perhaps it was a little overlooked, what with all the fuss around Steve Vai and the JEM, but it would turn out to be an even more important guitar in Ibanez history.', 'The new RG (not be confused with earlier-style RGs) was almost identical to the JEM, minus the wild colors and fancy inlays, the Monkey Grip handle, and the scalloped frets. Steve and the JEM were beacons that drew a great deal of attention to Ibanez, but the various new RG models that followed were lights that would burn brightly and consistently every day.', "In the late '80s and into the early '90s, following its introduction of the JEMs and the revised RGs, Ibanez found a fresh confidence, buoyed up by the success of these new designs. And it didn't hurt much when Kramer—the brand that had dominated the '80s—went bust in spectacular fashion around the end of that decade.", 'Ibanez has issued a number of different JEM models over the years since the introduction of the 777. One of the oddest was the JEM77FP, the FP standing for Floral Pattern finish, a vivid printed cloth bonded to the body. At first, Ibanez planned to make just one guitar like this, special for Steve. Nick Sugimoto at Fujigen R&D had recently helped Fender reissue its paisley-finish Telecasters, which also employed a bonded-material finish, and that proved to be useful experience.', '"At the end of the \'87 NAMM show, there was Steve on stage with this flower-pattern guitar," Nick remembers. "And, of course, all the distributors saw this—and they wanted this other new JEM guitar, too! So now we had to work out how to make it as a production model. That meant a lot of work, developing glue sprays, sealing coats, and so on. That\'s why it took eight months from the NAMM show before we could issue that guitar."', "There was the JEM-EVO of 2012, a scratch-by-dent-by-ding re-creation of Steve's favorite guitar since about 1993, the JEM he calls Evo. Nick Sugimoto, by now running his own Sugi Guitars workshop in Matsumoto, made the 100-piece limited-edition aged guitar.", "A 20th anniversary JEM model in 2007 had a see-through acrylic body with internal LEDs, and the JEM2KDNA—one of Ibanez's special millennium models in 2000—had Steve's DNA incorporated into the fingerboard's vine inlay.", '"I went to the hospital and had a lot of blood drawn," he remembers with a grimace. "It\'s not like there\'s a tiny drop of my blood on those guitars. There\'s a lot! I had to eat plenty of bananas after that. A hundred years from now, if they get cloning down, maybe they can take one of these DNA guitars and clone me out of the guitar? And then maybe that guy can get his music on the radio."', "Today, there are three levels of JEM in Ibanez's catalogue, starting with the budget white JEMJR and yellow or pink JEMJRSP, made in Indonesia. Moving on, there's the middle-ranking Premium blue floral JEM77P and white JEM7VP, both also Indonesian. And up at the high end, there's the white JEM7V, made in Japan. Reflected in the price points, they come with varying neck and body materials and construction, different pickups, metalwork plating, fret treatment, and so on.", 'Bill Reim, who today is Hoshino USA\'s CEO, says: "The JEM design was a real homogenization of a lot of different ideas that people were putting on the table, but mostly it was Steve. He was very definitive. He knew what he liked and he knew what he didn\'t like."', 'Steve is happy with the continuing success of the JEMs more than 30 years since the first models were introduced. "The people who are the fans and stuff, and collectors, and people who like a fine type of guitar, they will still buy the JEM," he says. "And I\'ve never wanted to play anything else. Still, to this day, I reach for my JEMs, because nothing else is as comfortable. I like to visit New York now and then, you know? And I like to visit Napa. But there\'s no place like home."', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music. He is a co-founder of Backbeat UK and Jawbone Press.

A decade later their first album had sold a staggering nine million copies, and by 2003 it had gone platinum 17 times. Hidden behind the group's breakthrough success was a tale of DIY home recording for the ages, one that has since become almost as celebrated as the music itself.", "When Boston first stormed onto the scene 43 years ago, many fans and industry insiders were likely unaware that one of the group's founding members, Tom Scholz, recorded the vast majority of the group's debut inside his Watertown, Massachusetts home studio.", '"It was a tiny little space next to the furnace in this hideous pine-paneled basement of my apartment house, and it flooded from time to time with God knows what," Scholz told Guitar World in a 2006 interview. "I put in some partitions, and I built a tiny isolation booth that was completely carpeted."', "Undeterred by the lack of bells and whistles around him, he masterminded some of the most enduring hits in rock n' roll history in his basement. As Scholz watched a bandmate purchase an outrageous customized guitar that took thousands of dollars from the album budget during the creation of Boston, he instead opted to use a rather pedestrian stringed instrument to record Boston's biggest hit of all-time.", '"The acoustic guitar on \'More Than a Feeling\' was recorded using a $100 imported Yamaha 12-string guitar, through a relatively low-end dynamic microphone [the Electro-Voice RE15], and the drums were recorded by a few Shure SM57s in a little tiny closet," he told the EE Times in a 1998 interview. The song later peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 in December of 1976 and spent over four months on the charts.', 'Adding further intrigue and legend to the process behind Boston\'s debut, the band fooled Epic into thinking they were laying down tracks at a proper studio in Los Angeles while Scholz toiled away in his basement and did much of the recording himself. In the end, it cost the group a paltry few thousand dollars to capture the sounds you hear on Boston, with all but one track ("Let Me Take You Home Tonight") from the official release a near-carbon-copy of the original basement demos.', 'Seeing the remarkable success of music made with such limitations taught Scholz a valuable and enduring lesson. "That\'s when I realized that you don\'t need all that fancy stuff," he told the EE Times.', "As the '70s gave way to the 1980s, rock 'n' roll wasn't the only genre with artists making defining songs and albums out of DIY home recording techniques; rap music provided an exciting new pocket of the industry that expanded every single year in size and scope. As the emerging genre grew in popularity and commercial success, the astronomical cost of proper drum machines and samplers remained a significant barrier to entry for many aspiring producers. An in-demand Akai S900 sampler cost roughly $2,800 in 1986, the equivalent of $6,260 modern US dollars.", 'Rap music pioneers adapted to steep equipment prices by using their cassette decks and boomboxes to make beats. With approximately 7.8 million boomboxes selling around the world in 1980, a new generation of visionaries were given the tools needed to remix and sample. Using the record and pause buttons on their cassette players, early bedroom beatmakers created what later became known as pause tapes. They would record a small part of a given song onto a tape, press the pause button, rewind the desired sample back to the beginning, unpause the tape, and repeat the process until they had an extended loop or beat.', "Q-Tip from the group A Tribe Called Quest took pause-tape loop production to unprecedented levels at age 16 by making demos of the majority of the beats from Tribe's debut album People's Instinctive Travels and The Paths of Rhythm. Using a cassette deck and his father's records, Tip stitched together bits and pieces of vinyl that would later form a timeless classic.", 'When the album hit shelves in 1990, The Source praised the "sophisticated production invoking a jazz flavor" of People\'s Instinctive Travels while giving it a perfect 5-mic review. Meanwhile, hip-hop activist Harry Allen wrote, "What A Tribe Called Quest did to hip-hop was help widen its sonic vocabulary," in the album\'s 25th anniversary liner notes for Legacy Recordings. In the end, Q-Tip managed to alter our expectations for rap music production with a bunch of samples he looped on a tape deck.', 'The history of DIY, bedroom-production ingenuity in rap music goes well beyond the limits of pause tapes and exceeds the scope of this article, but Nate Dogg and Warren G\'s hit 1994 single "Regulate" is another case study worth mentioning.', "In a 2016 episode of NPR's Microphone Check podcast, rapper and producer Warren G revealed that he sampled a snippet of the movie Young Guns from a VCR with his Akai MPC60 for the song's opening. As if that weren't enough, he explained in a 2011 episode of Skee TV that he and Nate Dogg recorded their vocals inside of a closet in his apartment. When DJ Skee asks if they had to re-record their vocals later, Warren G confirms that the raps and singing we hear today from his single—which went platinum and hit No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100—are the same ones recorded in a closet many years ago.", "As the '90s wore on, another important technological shift happened that helped open even more doors to future bedroom musicians. Computers rapidly dropped in price while simultaneously improving in performance and quality. Meanwhile, programs like FL Studio and Reason become another viable option for artists in all genres to create and record music in makeshift home studios. These programs provided access to young, aspiring creators who might have a home PC but couldn't afford proper instruments or studio gear.", 'British singer/songwriter and New Zealand native Daniel Bedingfield is an early example of this new generation of artists, achieving extraordinary results with his 2001 dance smash "Gotta Get Through This," while utilizing the most stripped-down of setups. "This track, along with some others, were recorded in my bedroom with my PC and a microphone, using the music software Reason," he revealed in a post on his Facebook page.', 'Bedingfield\'s hit song wound up reaching the top of the UK Singles Chart in both 2001 and 2002, while also scoring a Grammy nomination for Best Dance Recording. Reflecting on the unexpected success of his modest home recording, he seemed optimistic about what his story could mean for the future of recorded music. "Other than poverty, there\'s no excuse," he told Billboard in a 2002 interview. "The big studios are shutting down, and the little home studios are taking over."', "Georgia native Ernest Greene, better known to the music world as Washed Out, also found significant success. While unemployed, facing the recession's crushing aftermath and a pending wedding, he moved back into his parents' house in 2009 to save money and look for work. In the wee hours of the night, the wayward 26-year-old would play synths in his bedroom and make beats on his laptop, often reviewing his work through headphones while his parents slept.", 'After uploading a few tracks to MySpace and changing his name to Washed Out, the music blogs No Pain In Pop and Gorilla vs. Bear discovered his work, eventually leading to features on sites like Pitchfork. By September of 2009 he released his debut EP Life of Leisure—which features his biggest song "Feel It All Around"—on the Mexican Summer label. Though none of the songs on Life of Leisure made the Billboard charts, "Feel It All Around" is a powerful hit in its own right, scoring over 61 million plays on Spotify and becoming the theme song for IFC\'s Portlandia.', 'Shortly before music journalists discovered Washed Out via MySpace, SoundCloud launched in October of 2008. The advent of SoundCloud and its rapid rise in popularity in the following years provided another new, important technological shift for the home studio musician. It gave aspiring artists and established acts alike a new level of user-friendliness and -ease when it came to uploading music. Whether someone wanted to share a rough-cut demo, an unreleased remix, or a standard song from an album, the platform made it incredibly easy for DIYers to share their work. By 2012, The Next Web reported that users were uploading 10 hours of new music every minute, and, by 2013, SoundCloud boasted 40 million registered users.', 'Though SoundCloud has certainly had a bumpier road in recent years, it remains an invaluable resource for those making music in their own living spaces and seeking discovery. It certainly proved a perfect venue for sibling collaborators Billie Eilish and Finneas O\'Connell. Eilish\'s road to superstardom started in 2015 when O\'Connell, then 17, wrote the song "Ocean Eyes" for Eilish, then 13, to help with her dance class assignment. Though Eilish loved the song and enjoyed singing and recording it, she didn\'t anticipate much of a reaction when they posted it to SoundCloud.', '"We put it on SoundCloud with a free download link next to it so my dance teacher could access it," she told Teen Vogue in a 2017 article. "We had no intentions for it, really. But basically overnight a ton of people started hearing it and sharing it." To date, "Ocean Eyes" has 24.8 million plays on SoundCloud.', "While the results for Eilish and O'Connell have been staggering in four years since (Eilish now averages over 45 million monthly listeners on Spotify), their method for making music remains fairly simple.", "The two artists record together in the same cozy family home they grew up in. Everything in their simple home studio is accessible at a moment's notice, and that's just how they like it.", '"To me it\'s all about immediacy. The way I want any home studio to function is I want it all to be as fast as I can think of an idea I want to articulate it," O\'Connell said in a 2019 interview for the video series SPACES.', 'According to O\'Connell, he and Eilish added interesting percussive elements to her Vince Staples–assisted single "&burn" by standing in a bathroom, striking matches, and recording them. Meanwhile, Eilish recorded the majority of the vocals for her When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? while sitting on her brother\'s bed with a mic in her hand. Low-budget and low-key, for sure, but it\'s hard to argue with the results: Eilish\'s debut hit No. 1 on Billboard upon release and later returned to the top of the charts in May.', 'And despite any technical limitations their home-recording space may have, it gives Eilish and O\'Connell a secret advantage that a professional studio cannot. "It\'s our house and it\'s where we live—it\'s where we\'ve experienced everything," O\'Connell told SPACES. "That allows us to make [music] that is wholeheartedly exposed as far as who we really are as people, as siblings and as children of our parents."', "After examining Billie Eilish's meteoric rise, it's fair to wonder if home recording has reached a new apex in the four decades since Boston recorded a 17X platinum album in a basement. In some ways, it hasn't changed that much. Talented visionaries and trendsetters of all ages are making do with available resources and making beautiful music in their living spaces, just as a certain sector of the recording industry always has. But the distribution channels have changed drastically—with the advent of SoundCloud and the ever-growing popularity of various streaming platforms and YouTube—giving artists potentially immediate access to an audience of an almost unfathomable size.", 'Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas are certainly not the first people to build massive followings on SoundCloud and leverage that following for further success. But the recent success of When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? is a valuable case study with important takeaways. People want rich, full, and sometimes album-length listening experiences, despite what everyone tells us about shrinking attention spans.', "For some artists, their best chance for striking just the right chord happens when they're making music where they're most comfortable—at home.", "[Of course, in one article, we couldn't touch on every great record made in a bedroom or simple home studios. What are some of your favorites? Let us know in the comments.]", 'About the author: Gino Sorcinelli is the writer, creator, and editor of Micro-Chop, a Substack newsletter that dissects beatmaking, DJing, music production, rapping, and sampling.

guitar players and collectors worldwide, like “Burst,” “Blackguard,” “Plexi,” and “Blackface.” Named for their black control panels, Blackface Fender amps are one of the company’s most famous and coveted product series.', 'Blackface Fender amps tend to be categorized into two groups by collectors and players: “Pre-CBS” (mid-1963 to mid-1965) models with a “Fender Electric Instrument Company” label and “CBS” (mid-1965 to mid-1968) models with a “Fender Musical Instrument” label.', 'Blackface amps were immediately popular upon release and used on numerous famous recordings. They continue to be a backline and recording mainstay of musicians who seek a great, chimey Fender clean and, when pushed, a classic overdriven tone. Fender offered a full range of amps in their Blackface line, ranging from the diminutive Champ to the massive Twin Reverb.', 'Cosmetically, the amps featured the aforementioned black control panels with white lettering, black tolex protective covering, and silver thread grill cloth. Attesting to Leo Fender’s engineering genius, Blackface Fenders are legendary for their rock-solid reliability. Built like a proverbial tank, these 50-plus-year-old amps will be rocking way into the future.', 'In this guide, we’ll learn a bit about each of the amps in the Blackface lineup, including performance attributes, key tech specs, and famous users.', 'Fender offered three versions of the Champ during the Blackface period. Beginning in late 1963 and continuing into mid-1964, Fender used up remaining old “Tweed style” Champ chassis and cabinets, but with Blackface cosmetics; Leo Fender was famously known as a skinflint when it came to minimizing production costs. After all, he was the guy who reused his styrofoam cup for coffee. The new style Champ and Vibro Champ amps featured slanting control panels.', 'All of these amps put out about 4 watts and had a single 8” speaker. These amps, fondly referred to as the “lunch box,” were sold by the thousands to students and professionals alike. Immediately popular for studio use, they also found favor from musicians playing small gigs. And of course, your Champ can be mic’d to be used in just about any size venue. Just grab your guitar and this little powerhouse and head out to the gig.', 'Tech Specs:', 'Famous Users: Eric Clapton', 'Once again, Fender issued three distinct variants of the Princeton amp during the Blackface era: the transitional “tuxedo” model, as well as reverb and non-reverb models in the new “Princeton” style. Each version featured a single 10” speaker and about 12 watts of output. Small, light and, like all Blackface Fenders, built like a tank, Princetons are a favorite of many guitarists (and harp players) for studio and live use. Mic’d, they can be used even in medium to large venues.', 'The tuxedo was the result of the ever-thrifty Leo Fender wanting to use up the remaining “brownface” Princeton Amp chassis and cabinets. Issued from mid-1963 to mid-1964, the tuxedo amps featured Blackface cosmetics, but were very snazzy looking with white barrel knobs.', 'Overshadowed by the Princeton Reverb, which is widely considered one of the most famous studio amps ever built, the non-reverb Princeton is a sleeper hit. Its existence in the shadow of its reverb-capable brother is a shame, as it offers some of the finest pure Fender tones you can find in a compact package. Also, the non-reverb models cost a lot less than the reverb amps. Plus, unlike the Reverb models, the non-reverb Princeton amp offers a significant amount of clean headroom.', 'The Princeton Reverb, on the other hand, has an extra 12AX7 preamp tube which gives it a more overdriven sound when the volume is pushed.', 'Tech Specs:', 'Famous Users: Mike Campbell', 'Moving up to one 12” speaker and about 20 watts with up both reverb and non-reverb models, the Deluxe amp is like a Princeton on steroids. With the Deluxe, you get a lot more bass response and plenty more clean headroom. One of the most legendary amps of all time, pristine Blackface Deluxe examples come with a steep price tag. Some players even fondly refer to their Deluxe Reverb as their “desert island” amp.', 'These amps are perfect for medium-sized venues. Mic’d, they can be used on large stages and even fare well in outdoor concerts. Still, with this amp, you get a lot of oomph and versatility in a compact and relatively light package.', 'Tech Specs:', '', 'Famous Users: Eric Johnson, J.D. Simo, Trey Anastasio', 'The non-reverb Vibrolux featured a single 12” speaker and boasted about 40 watts of output. It was generally discontinued by late 1963, with just a few issued in early 1964, and was replaced by a completely different combo amp of 35 watts, two 10” speakers and reverb. The Vibrolux Reverb is one of the most sought-after Blackface Fender amps, especially a clean “Fender Electric Instrument Company”-emblazoned example. Offering more guts and headroom than a Deluxe, it can be employed to meet a myriad of gigging situations.', 'Tech Specs:', 'Famous Users: Richie Kotzen', 'The non-reverb Pro amps were about 40 watts and had a single 15” speaker. By late 1964, they were replaced by the completely new Pro Reverb, which touted 40 watts and a pair of 12” speakers. Sometimes referred to as the “Baby Twin,” the Pro Reverb provided a lot of musical firepower and fit the bill in larger venues.', 'Tech Specs:', 'Famous Users: Pete Townshend was rumored to have used a brown Pro for early Who recordings.', 'The 4x10” Concert amp put out about 40 watts. A short-lived model, it was discontinued by mid-1964. Still, a lot of sound output for the money—and they tend to sell for a lot less than the similar-looking Super Reverb amps.', 'Tech Specs:', 'Famous Users: Pete Townshend used an early brown tolex Concert amp.', 'The Super Reverb, sporting 4x10” speakers and 40 watts of firepower, is another of the most legendary Blackface Fender amps. An industry standard, you’d be likely to find this amp everywhere from the studio to your local club’s backline. In addition to reverb, it featured a middle control on the Vibrato channel, enabling players to tweak treble response. Some of these amps came equipped from the factory with JBL speakers. The weight combined with the tall cabinet made them a true backbreaker, but many players happily endured the pain in exchange for the amp’s full sounds.', 'Tech Specs:', 'Famous Users: Stevie Ray Vaughan, Derek Trucks', 'One of the rarest of the Blackface Fender combo amps, the Vibroverb looks like a 1x15” Pro amp but with an onboard reverb. Very collectable, loud and fat sounding with its 15” speaker, the Vibroverb is a great choice if you have enough coin.', 'Tech Specs:', 'Famous Users: Stevie Ray Vaughan', 'The Twin Reverb was the absolute top of the line in Fender’s Blackface range. Designed for a lot of clean, clear output, it boasted four 6L6GC power tubes for 85 watts and a pair of heavy duty Oxford 12T6 speakers. JBL D120F speakers could be factory-ordered for enhanced clarity and volume (not to mention the added potential to dislocate shoulder sockets).', 'Country players love the Twin for its crystal clear tone—a Tele lead pickup through a Twin could be an instrument of sonic destruction. Also a favorite with blues and rock players, Michael Bloomfield used to dime his Twin to unleash an onslaught of blues tones.', 'Tech Specs:', 'Famous Users: Mike Bloomfield, James Burton, Johnny Winter', "While most commonly seen in combo configurations, Fender also produced a number of head and cabinet stacks in the Blackface era. Here's a look at some of the Fender’s Blackface “piggyback” amps.", 'The Tremolux was Fender’s smallest piggyback amp. About 35 watts of output, the amps were offered with with a single or pair of 10” speakers. The Tremolux was the only Blackface piggyback model that utilized a GZ34 tube rectifier; the rest of the piggyback models were solid-state rectified.', 'A tube rectifier offers a little more sag and, according to some, “juiciness” to the sound. The Tremolux amps are the unsung heroes of the Fender lineup and, as such, a great vintage deal. Plus, they’re easily usable in small- to medium-sized venues.', 'Tech Specs:', 'The Bandmaster was about 40 watts and came with a 2x12” speaker cabinet. Featuring a pair of 6L6GC power tubes, the Bandmaster was another good choice for small- to medium-sized venues.', "It's still well-loved for its vibrato circuit, and can be seen on the stages of discerning blues, Americana, or roots rock acts. But it's not only guitarists who like its slightly higher headroom (when compared to a Deluxe or smaller amp) or the growl it gets when pushed. The loud and tremulous sound also makes it a perfect amp for blues harmonica players, who have established another fanbase for the Bandmaster.", 'Tech Specs:', 'The famous Bassman had 50 watts of output and typically came with a 2x12” speaker cabinet. The Blackface era Bassman came in two variants: the 6G6B “tuxedo model” (which was just the earlier blonde Bassman with Blackface cosmetics) and the AA864 and AA165 models.', 'Just as guitarists tout the Tweed Bassmans as one of the finest guitar amps ever made, the Blackface Bassman makes a superb guitar amp as well. It delivers Fender chime and, when cranked, rich, fat overdrive tones. Due to its stout construction and massive transformers, the Bassman will tolerate a wide variety of speaker cabinets and loads.', 'Tech Specs:', 'Famous Users: Tom Petty, Mike Campbell, Mike Bloomfield, John Fogerty', 'The Showman had two cab options: a single 15” speaker, or the Dual Showman, which came with 2x15” speakers. Both were Fender’s flagship piggyback models.', 'Clocking in at 85 watts, these amps were clearly designed for large venues. These amps were prized for their considerable output and the clean tones they could produce through their JBL D130F or D140F speakers.', 'Tech Specs:', 'Famous Users: Mike Bloomfield, Dick Dale', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

You're not alone. Fenders rank as the most frequently bought and sold instruments on Reverb, and finding a precise date of manufacture can be key to determining the value and specifics of an instrument.", "The most important thing to keep in mind when dating a Fender is the highly modular nature of the designs. Like Henry Ford, part of Leo Fender's genius was in optimizing the company's production efficiency. His guitars were built en masse by an entire factory, not a single luthier toiling over one instrument at a time. Features like bolt-on necks and pickups wired into the pickguard all helped the Fender factory churn out guitar after guitar, day after day. This also means that various parts used on a particular guitar may have come from different points in time, so no single number can absolutely define when the instrument was built.", "Instead, the best approach to dating a Fender is to combine indicators from the design of the instrument, the dates found on the neck and body, along with the serial number. Once you have the information you need, if you're interested in selling your Fender, you can use Reverb to get it in front of the largest audience of musicians in the world by clicking on this link.", "Perhaps the best place to start when dating your Fender is to get an approximate idea of the era based on the instrument's design and components. This can be a tall order for someone less versed in guitar history, but we do have some resources here on Reverb to help you out.", "For starters, there's the Reverb Price Guide which has thousands of entries with pictures and details on various guitars and other gear. Some browsing around the Fender section of the Price Guide can definitely help you find which model you have.", "We also have some other blog posts related to Fender that can hopefully be of some help. There's A Brief History of the Stratocaster Part I and Part II that follows the evolution of the most popular Fender guitar of all. Similarly, take a look at Behold the Jazzmaster for general timeline of the history of everyone's favorite offset guitar. For Fender during the turning point era of the mid-'60s, check out Fender and the CBS Takeover.", "Through much of Fender's production history, Fender workers would print or write a production date on both bodies and necks where the two pieces meet. These dates will tell when the original part was manufactured, but are not exact indicators of when the guitar was actually put together and finished.", 'Here is what the neck date and body date look like from a 1952 Telecaster:', "If you're not comfortable removing the neck of a guitar to peek at the date marker, I encourage you to take it to a local tech or luthier.", 'I will also mention briefly pot-codes as a resource (numbers on the internal potentiometers of the guitar). These can definitely be useful in cases where no other numbers exist, but just tell when the pot itself was made. Who knows how long it was waiting in the Fender factory before finding its way into a Tele?', "Like the body and neck dates, using serial numbers to date a Fender is not a sure bet. At many points in Fender's history, serial number usage overlapped again owing to the modular manner of production. Below we'll go into detail about the various serial number schemes employed by Fender as far back as 1950. There are certainly plenty of exceptions, so again, using serial numbers in conjunction with other dating methods is always the best bet.", 'Click on the links here to jump directly to the serial number style that matches your instrument:', 'In the early years, Fender serial numbers schemes were specific to the model. Esquires, Broadcasters and Telecasters shared a serial number sequence, while the landmark Precision Bass had its own system. In this early period, the serial number can be found on the bridge of the instrument (see image).', 'Here are the rough serial number ranges for the early Esquires and Telecasters:', 'And here are the ranges for the original Precision Basses:', 'Also, for the first half or so of 1954, the inaugural run of Stratocasters had a distinct number sequence all under number 6000.', 'By mid-1954, Fender began using a universal serial number sequence for all its instruments. At this time, the location of the serial number also shifted from the bridge to the neckplate (the metal plate located on back of where the neck meets the body).', "Here's how the serial numbers break down from 1954 to the beginning of 1963, though there are some areas of inconsistency in this era:", 'At the very end of 1962 and into 1963, Fender changed to a system where serial numbers began with an "L." According to some accounts, the L was supposed to just be a 1 to mark the cross over into the 100,000 range from the previous scheme, but an L was used by mistake.', 'Here the range of the L-series serial used each year. Some of the earliest ones actually popped up in late 1962 as well:', "After the CBS purchase of Fender in 1965, the factory switched to a new serial sequence with numbers that continued the same general format used prior to the takeover. These are generally referred to as F series due the large Fender branded F on the neckplates of the era. This period also saw a switch from the orginal four-bolt neckplate of the '60s to a three-bolt neckplate in just one example of cost-saving costs introduced under CBS.", 'Starting in 1976, Fender transitioned to a new serial number scheme and moved the placement of most serial numbers to the headstock of the instrument. Depending on the era and model, the number can be found on either the front or back of the headstock.', "After a short period of overlap with the old system, the post-76 numbers will start with a letter that indicates the decade, followed by a number that indicates the year of that decade. The decade letter codes break down like this: S = 1970s, E = 1980s, N = 1990s, Z = 2000s. In the 2000s, you'll also see serials starting with a DZ which indicates the Deluxe series, but the format is otherwise the same.", 'For example, a serial number with N4 would be from 1994. One starting with Z5 would be from 2005.', "This scheme is not 100% consistent due to a number of production factors, such as Fender producing more serialized decals than needed in a given year. This is particularly pronounced in the transitional period of the mid-'80s, though the system has been pretty much on point since about 1990.", 'After 2009, the letter changed to a format starting with US then two digits that tell the year of the current decade.', "Here's the breakdown of Post-1976 American-made Fender serials:", 'Signature Series', 'American-made signature series instruments follow a very similar scheme to the above, but use a prefix S before the decade letter. For example, a Signature Series guitar from 1998 would have a serial starting with SN8 followed by five digits.', 'American Vintage Reissue models', 'The major exception to all of this is the American Vintage Reissue (AVRI) series. These have serial numbers starting with V and do not strictly correlate to years. The neck dates on these guitars, however, are usually reliable.', 'Fender Japan serial numbers can usually be found on the back of the neck near the neck joint. Though examples also exist with the number on the headstock or the neck-plate in the case of certain early reissue models. Up until 1997, the serial was paired with the words "Made in Japan."', 'In 1982, Fender expanded operations with a series of instruments produced in Japan by the Fuji Gen Gakki company. Like the US serial numbers, MIJ (made in Japan) serials start with a letter or pair of letters that indicate the rough year of production. This system, however, is notoriously inconsistent and incomplete, which makes dating by serial number even less reliable for MIJ Fenders.', 'Here\'s a breakdown of serials for the "Made in Japan" era:', 'Crafted in Japan Serial Numbers', 'In 1997, Fender changed the "Made in Japan" decal to say "Crafted in Japan." There is some overlap with the earlier "MIJ" serials, so it\'s important to note if your instrument carries the "Made in Japan" or "Crafted in Japan" decal.', 'Here are the serial numbers for the "Crafted in Japan" or "CIJ" era:', 'After 2007, Fender Japan switched back to marking Fenders as "Made in Japan" though for a few years instruments with both decals were made. Serial numbers since this transition have continued the same sequence as the "CIJ" era.', 'Secure Transactions and Shipping Protection\nDedicated Team of Gear Experts', 'Fender opened a factory in Ensenada, Mexico in the late \'80s and instruments started coming off the line in 1990. Mexican-made (MIM) Fenders carry a serial number on the headstock starting with an M. Some exceptions include a handful of special editions and signature models as well as the split US/Mexican-made California series which all have a "AMXN" at the beginning of their serials.', 'The MIM serial number scheme is actually very straight-forward. For Mexican Fenders made in the 1990s, the serial will start with an MN followed by a number that indicates the year of the decade. Instruments made in the 2000s follow the same form but start with MZ. For the 2010s, the prefix is MX1. For example, a serial number starting with MN2 would be 1992.', "Here's the serial number breakdown for a majority of MIM Fenders:", "There are a number of exceptions to all these serial number schemes. As mentioned above, many reissue models use serial numbers that don't really correlate to their age. Additionally, there have been plenty of artist models, limited editions and other rare models that use a unique serial number. Examples include the 35th anniversary series, many of the uniquely finished Strats from the early '80s, as well as various export-specific models which carry a serial number starting with FN.", "Again, the serial number alone in any of these cases is not definitive and the best approach is to combine that with other methods like the neck and body dates, as well as just the features of the specific instrument. If you have any questions as to what Fender you're dealing with, I encourage you to seek out a local guitar shop or luthier to help figure it out.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

As the prices of vintage synthesizers climb ever higher, wouldn't it be great to be able to get largely the same feature set of a desired synth without the eye-watering price? We're here to tell you that can (sometimes) be the case.", 'To maximize sales and reach customers with different budgets, manufacturers often released essentially the same synth in a number of different guises. The rackmount was a popular format, although ironically what was meant to be the cheaper option (keybeds are expensive) have become expensive collectors items in their own right due to scarcity.', "But in many cases, there is often a relatively unknown and thus inexpensive version of a more popular synth available, sometimes even with a better feature set. Releasing multiple versions of the same instrument was a popular sales strategy in the 1980s, so it's more prevalent in the digital realm, but analog aficionados may be in luck too.", 'Purists may quibble, but the sounds in these alternative models can get you awfully close to those of their more-famous siblings, at a fraction of the cost.', 'Alternative to: Roland D-50', "Released in 1988, the Roland D-50 was a very popular digital synth, coming at a time when FM's star was beginning to wane and musicians were looking for something new. With a novel new form of synthesis that combined sampled transients with early analog modeling, the D-50 was capable of everything from bread-and-butter keyboard sounds to lush, evolving soundscapes. As you might expect, it still commands a robust price tag to this day.", 'To capitalize on its popularity, Roland released the D-10 not long after. It had the same LA (linear arithmetic) synthesis as its big brother, but lacked some of the LFOs that helped contribute to the D-50 being known as a pad machine.', "However, if you're looking for those digital bread-and-butter keyboard sounds, the D-10 will do you nicely and at a much lower price. Also worth looking into are the D-5, with its arpeggiator, the D-20 and its sequencer, and the D-110 rack unit, which is multitimbral.", 'Alternative to: Yamaha DX100', "In the mid-'80s, Yamaha was riding high with FM synthesis. The DX7 and its offspring consistently occupied synth bestseller lists, and if you couldn't afford the flagship model, you could be sure of finding something to fit your budget that maybe was not quite as good but still capable of FM synthesis. In 1985, Yamaha released the DX100, a diminutive four-operator synth that has recently become a collector's machine thanks to its association with Detroit techno (and Roger Troutman!).", "If you're after that classic sound but don't want to lay out the bread, look to the DX21. Despite having the same sounds (including the Solid Bass preset), as well as adding chorus and the ability to layer—not to mention 61 full-size keys—it languishes in obscurity. It's just as techno for a fraction of the price.", "There's also the DX27, which does away with the chorus, and even the DX27S, which has speakers.", 'Alternative to: Roland Juno-106', "Everyone knows the Roland Juno-106. Released in 1985, this single-oscillator analog polysynth has become a must-have machine for a number of reasons, but mainly because it sounds amazing. In fact, it's seemingly incapable of sounding bad. Despite the fact that the voice chips will eventually have to be repaired (or replaced with clones), and despite the inevitable cost associated with this, prices continue to climb.", 'Unfortunately, there\'s no mythical, affordable version of the 106, but there were a few alternative versions worth keeping an eye out for. While most fall into the "rare, so expensive" category, the HS-60 home version is something of a sleeper. Although it loses the 106\'s good looks in favor of something you might see on top of your uncle\'s organ, inside it\'s all Juno-106.', "That also means you'll have to deal with the bad chips, but at least you'll have saved a bit in the outlay. It also has speakers, so there you go.", 'Alternative to: Yamaha DX7', "The DX7 effectively changed the synthesizer landscape of the '80s, ushering in a new era of clean, digital sounds and sleek, knob-less synths. It also appeared around the same time as MIDI, which meant that its innards could be jammed inside a little box, sold without a keyboard, and called an expander. Enter the TX7, released in 1985.", "Although it looks more like a TV-top cable box from the 1980s than a synthesizer, inside is a DX7, just like you want. Well, almost. The TX7 doesn't allow editing from the front panel, meaning all programming has to be done via external MIDI. At the time this was nigh-on impossible, but these days, thanks to the proliferation of editors, as well as softsynths like Dexed, it's easy enough to work with. Granted, it doesn't look as cool as a full DX7, but it's certainly a good deal.", 'Alternative to: Moog Rogue', "It's hard to imagine now, but there was a time when RadioShack commanded a large share of the audio and electronics market—large enough that it could sell rebranded versions of popular instruments at discount prices. It did this with Casio's consumer keyboards and also with a little synthesizer company called Moog.", "Yes, in the early '80s RadioShack sold a modified Moog synthesizer under its house brand name, Realistic, and called it the Concertmate MG-1. It featured the two-oscillator monophonic analog architecture that would eventually be released by Moog as the Rogue, but also offered a polyphonic, organ-like divide-down oscillator section, plus a ring modulator.", "Although a Moog inside, because it doesn't say Moog on the case it sells for less than its step brothers. Beware when buying an MG-1, though, as many units suffer from the polyurethane insulation having melted over time.", 'Alternative to: Oberheim Matrix-6', 'It\'s extremely rare to see the words "Oberheim" and "budget" in the same sentence, but that\'s just what we\'re talking about. In 1987, Oberheim stubbornly released a 1-U rack version of its lovely Matrix-6, bucking the digital trend and staying with what had made it famous: analog. Dubbed the Matrix-1000, it was intended as a preset version of the former synth and so came loaded with (you guessed it) 1000 presets.', "Although gorgeous in sound, due to the difficulty of programming it from the front panel it never gained the popularity of its big brother. Although thought of as a preset player, it does indeed have full programmability, including the mod matrix of the 6. And, thanks to modern editors and new hardware programmers, the full functionality of it is just waiting to be unleashed—and at an affordable price. Luscious pads, gorgeous brass, silky leads: It's all Oberheim and it's all here.", 'Alternative to: Korg DW-8000', 'In 1984, Korg released the DW-6000, a hybrid digital/analog synthesizer. Yamaha had the patent on FM, so other manufacturers were busy trying to find a hit with their own brand of digital synthesis. Casio knocked it out of the park with PD (phase distortion) and its CZ line, while Korg put its money on a hybrid architecture (until it finally had a hit itself with the M1).', 'Featuring two oscillators, each capable of playing one of eight single-cycle waveforms, an analog filter and VCA, and an unusual digital delay, the DW-6000 was soon superseded by the DW-8000, which added eight more waves and velocity sensitivity.', 'While the DW-8000 is arguably the better machine, it also commands a higher price tag. The DW-6000 is a fine synthesizer capable of some truly unique timbres and can handle both analog- and digital-style sounds with ease. Well worth checking out.', 'Alternative to: Casio CZ-1000', "As I wrote above, Casio's phase distortion technology was meant to compete with Yamaha's FM synthesis, and compete it did, thanks to an almost analog-like warmth and low price. The CZ-101 was the most popular synth to feature PD, but Casio released a number of other machines in the same range, most bigger and better.", "The CZ-1000, the full-size key version of the CZ-101, and the CZ-5000 had chorus, layering, and even a unique sequencer. Casio's groundbreaking synths are experiencing something of a surge in popularity these days, with rising prices to accompany it.", 'However, released in 1985, the original CZ-101 is still a bargain, likely because so many were made. If you\'ve ever played with a Casio consumer keyboard, you know what to expect from the keys, but the sound is exactly the same as on the larger, more "pro" versions. The CZ-101 is still the most affordable way to get your hands on a PD machine.', 'Have your own favorite sleeper alternatives?

"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)" by Metallica opens with a haunting riff, awash in thick shuddering chorus, familiar to anyone who ever dipped their toe in the pool of mid-\'80s power ballads. The Smiths\' jangle pop spangled with layers of delicate leads that set a precedent for indie rock to come.', "While these groups inhabited opposite ends of the spectrum musically, they both tapped in to chorus to give their guitars that warm honeyed feel, popularized first by Boss's CE-1 and then the CE-2.", "Eventually chorus oversaturated the airwaves—and the pedal market, for that matter. From the mid-'90s through to the 2000s it grew out of favor and out of touch. To some it still has a dated feel, but for many artists of the past decade the stigma of 1980s glitz has shed away, and chorus has made a massive return to pedalboards everywhere.", 'One modern-day devotee is the barely 21-year-old songwriter, producer, and artist Steve Lacy. A prolific wizard of grooves, Lacy has been sprinkling chorus into his tone potions since his early days of high school. As a noted Prince fan, Lacy is unafraid of cranking the chorus and articulating marble-smooth leads over the funkiest of tracks. With his new album, Apollo XXI, released in 2019, he steps further down the rabbit hole, crafting effortless tunes that swirl in a cloud of chorus.', 'Prince songs like "Raspberry Beret" and of course "Purple Rain" seem like obvious references for Lacy, with icy Linn LM1-esque beats counterbalanced against sensual guitar licks. (It should be noted that, in the same way the Prince often crafted chorus tones not with a chorus pedal but his VB-2 Vibrato, Lacy also eschews the obvious, often using just the stock effects and presets in Apple\'s free GarageBand DAW.) Still, Lacy\'s songs breathe with a warmth indebted to the R&B of the \'80s and \'90s. Chords are bent around basslines, and lend an ebb and flow to his melodies.', 'On The Internet\'s "It Gets Better With Time," from last year\'s Hive Mind, Lacy strums a few chords before letting the last notes billow through a chorusy breeze. There is a minimalism to his style that never feels lacking, where the guitar leaves space for the vocals or keys, without feeling vacant. His songs are both timeless and of the now.', "Lacy has recently contributed to Vampire Weekend's new album, and his songwork with them has shades of Paul Simon's Graceland while simultaneously setting guide posts for pop of the near-future.", "Another artist Lacy has cited as a heavy influence is the proverbial prince of seasick guitars, Mac DeMarco. The Canadian jangle wrangler may not have been the first guy of the 2010s to step on a Boss CE-2 (or Ibanez CS9) but he certainly has become the most prominent. Around 2009 and 2010, a number of groups were gazing back to the time of C86 and lo-fi, tape-warped pop of the '80s. Ariel Pink, Beach Fossils, and Wild Nothing were all early purveyors of this revived sound, but DeMarco, who joined the scene a few years later, really took lo-fi to another level.", 'From the first few notes of "Cooking Up Something Good" off 2 there\'s an unmistakable warble to his guitar tone that has become quintessentially Mac DeMarcian. It sounds as if his guitar were recorded to tape and then left it out in the sun too long.', "The persistence of slightly off-ness can be intrinsic to a chorused-out vibe, and Demarco tends to slather it on like the perfunctory spreading of schmeer at a bagel store. To a casual listener Mac could be construed as a noodling pseudo-folk goofball, but it becomes apparent that his songwriting and style of playing have an undeniable depth to them. Like Lacy, he's too good to be bad, even when the notes seem like they're about to slip off the page.", 'DeMarco\'s effect processing, he\'s claimed, has remained limited, kept to a CE-2 for live settings and dialing in the chorus sounds of an Alesis Microverb 4 for past studio recordings. His most recent record, Here Comes the Cowboy, veers away from the dripping, picked-guitar style but still feels unquestionably his own. Lead single, "Nobody," is focused around a wavering Juno-like synth pad that sounds like a toy Groan Tube being tracked through a low-rate stereo chorus. Even if his Boss pedals are growing cobwebs, he hasn\'t lost that loving feeling for chorus-churned modulation.', 'Continuing in the vein of bizzaro but beautifully quavering pop, it bears mentioning Cate Le Bon, the Welsh master of geodesic timbres. Le Bon has been sculpting stunning off-kilter pop for the better part of a decade, and her most recent album, Reward, is her most powerful collection to date.', "In its basest form, it's a record of druggy, baroque-pop infused with slippery chorus-laden guitar and chunky piano. Reward is a record that feels very in-touch with groundbreaking 1980s releases from experimental art-pop label, 4AD. Le Bon's album, out with Mexican Summer (a sort of modern day 4AD), touches on a lot of hallmarks from 4AD greats such as Cocteau Twins, His Name Is Alive, Red House Painters, and This Mortal Coil. What these groups had in common was an affinity for 1960s singer-songwriters, a penchant for strong writing, and a tonality that leaned toward romantic melancholia.", 'This is perhaps what bridges the gap between acts of the 1980s and artists like Le Bon today, who are less interested in dialing in the nostalgia, but rather tapping into feelings of listless yearning that chorus so effectively evokes. For the Cocteau Twins\' primary songwriter Robin Guthrie, chorus was almost another instrument, able to glimmer like the shores of a dream and counterbalance the ethereal vocals of singer Liz Fraser. For Le Bon\'s mid-tempo single "Daylight Matters," she bellows the lyrics, "Love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, But you\'re not here." All while a crumbling guitar riff gorgeously shudders through a chorusy haze.', 'For some people, chorus produces the sort of groan-worthy soap-opera-soundtrack chords they\'d just as well forget altogether. But for artists like Cate Le Bon it can act as a needle, stitching together themes of lonesomeness and deep romanticism. Famously, the heavy sampling and meticulous editing that went into recording Chris Isaak\'s "Wicked Game," involved running the lead guitar through an Eventide H3000 stereo Rich Chorus program, producing one of the most recognizable and romantic guitar lines of all time. (Fulltone even makes a new rackmount unit—That 80\'s Rack Chorus— with the same delay chips found in the famous Tri Stereo Chorus effects of that era.)', 'Many other rising indie stars continue to bring new life to chorus pedals and processors. Men I Trust, a three-piece band from Quebec that dabbles in dream pop, have some of the slinkiest chorus-glazed melodies of recent memory. They have a new record due out this year and have preceded it with one infectious single after the next. Another notable chorus peddler is Thom Giles, the man behind the group Vesuvio Solo and, more recently, Blue Material. Whatever the project, Giles expertly brews up careful batches of sleazy pop that sound like disco singles recovered from a dusty crate in a forgotten attic.', 'Whether chorus rings your bell or not, you can be sure to spot a heck of a lot more of it on future releases from this year and the next.', 'These are just some examples of modern chorus excellence. Let us know your favorites in the comments below.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

If you\'re a British guitar fan with an interest in vintage custom-color Fenders, you almost certainly have. You probably also know that the term is linked to a debate about whether or not new Fender instruments were refinished for the UK market during the \'60s.', "In the previous decade, budding British guitarists who fancied a stab at rock 'n' roll were poorly served by electric instruments. There was an import ban on US-made guitars and only a few firms closer to home willing to supply the growing demand. Grimshaw was the first UK brand to offer a hollowbody electric, while Selmer and Besson imported European-made Hofner and Aristone models. Following the arrival in 1958 of Britain's first rock 'n' roll TV show, Six-Five Special, it wasn't long before primitive UK-made solidbody instruments appeared by Supersound, Dallas, and Burns-Weill.", 'One of the biggest names on the scene was Cliff Richard and his backing band The Drifters, soon to become The Shadows. By 1959, their lead guitarist, Hank Marvin, was playing an Antoria solid, an early Japanese import made by Guyatone. Hank tells me it wasn\'t very good: "It had a thick neck, which was badly warped, creating a very high action. Cliff offered to buy me a good guitar, an offer I couldn\'t refuse."', "Hank suggested Cliff buy a Fender guitar, the type used by Buddy Holly and James Burton. With new American instruments unavailable thanks to the import ban, Cliff's management sent to the US for a Fender catalogue.", '"The wow factor was very high as we pored over the pictures and specifications of the various guitars and amps," Hank says, recalling that he favored the Stratocaster, the model Buddy Holly played and the most expensive in the line. "We assumed James Burton must also play that, but we later learned he played a Telecaster. I was very attracted to the catalogue cover photo of the red Strat with the maple neck and gold-plated hardware, and the order was placed as a personal import."', 'The Strat was delivered to the flat that Cliff, Hank, and rhythm guitarist Bruce Welch shared in London. "You can imagine the anticipation as we opened the cardboard packaging and extracted the guitar in its case," Hank says. "Keep in mind we had only seen photos of Stratocasters. We opened the tweed case and just looked at the Strat for a while, almost speechless. It was almost like a dream."', "Hank's Stratocaster, serial number 34346, was a special order instrument, among the last maple-fingerboard Strats to escape the Fender factory in 1959. Finished in custom color Roman Red and with gold-plated hardware, it featured a beautifully figured birdseye maple neck. The importance of this single instrument cannot be overstated: In Hank's hands it would turn the UK music scene on its head. His Strat not only looked and sounded futuristic but also represented a call to arms for young guitarists across the nation.", 'The Shadows were powered by Vox amplification, and Vox boss Tom Jennings quickly secured a deal for his Jennings company to become Fender\'s UK importer. Demand was high, and by fall 1960, Jennings offered Fender\'s complete line of guitars and amplifiers. Guitars and basses were available in standard Sunburst finish, or Blonde for Telecasters and what Jennings called "Mushroom" (Fender\'s Desert Sand) for the Musicmaster and Duo-Sonic.', "For an additional eight or nine guineas (a guinea was equal to £1 and one shilling), Blonde and Red (Fender's Fiesta Red) were available on all but the Telecaster and student models. (Fender had replaced Roman Red with Fiesta Red as the company formally organized its custom color options.)", 'Hank\'s patronage made red the most popular shade. Don Randall, Fender\'s sales boss, told me later that the company "could hardly keep up with orders for Fiesta Red instruments from the UK—it was the first time we had produced custom-finished instruments in any real quantities."', 'By summer 1962, there was friction between Randall and Jennings as Vox gave preference to its own line of amplifiers, and it led to Fender adding a second UK distributor, Selmer, who already imported Gibson guitars. Selmer offered a reduced line—Jaguar, Jazzmaster, Stratocaster, Jazz Bass, Precision Bass—in standard Sunburst, or in (Fiesta) Red for an additional six to eight guineas. The new Jaguar was also offered in (Sonic) Blue, (Olympic) White, and "Cream" (Fender\'s Blond). It was the first time these new Fender colors were seen in Britain, and many players wanted their band to have matched sets just like The Shadows. Stratocasters, Precisions, and Telecasters weren\'t available in the new shades, but this wasn\'t going to stop retailers giving customers what they wanted.', "Ted Lee was a semi-pro guitarist in a Manchester band called The Olympics, and one of his day jobs had been spray-painting cars in a local garage. His favorite music shop was Barratts in central Manchester, and when the shop's owner, Adrian Barratt, saw what Ted had done to a Dallas bass, he offered him work repairing guitars. Ted was too busy, but things changed when he bought his first Fender bass from Barratts, a Precision in Fiesta Red.", 'He didn\'t like what he calls its "pink" color, and after a few months he wanted to trade it in for a Sunburst example. Upon taking it back to the shop, Adrian asked how he\'d kept it in such fine condition. Ted explained how he used wet-and-dry sandpaper and cutting compound to remove dings and scratches. "He asked if I fancied spraying some guitars for Barratts," Ted recalls, "and this time I said yes."', 'Ted was soon spraying guitars for other music shops in Manchester, including Mameloks, Johnny Roadhouse, and Reno\'s. "They were mostly new Strats and Precisions, which I color-matched using a Fender custom color chart that Adrian gave me. I did spray other makes, including a couple for a certain Liverpudlian band. I also did Tony Hicks\'s Gibson 345 plus two for Graham Nash, all in black."', 'Ted set up shop in his garage at home, and by 1962 he was spraying four or five guitars a week, mainly new unsold Fenders. "The shops wanted them in different colors, mostly Fiesta Red, Sonic Blue, or white, over Sunbursts. I think I did around 200 Fenders like that, maybe more. There were others doing it down south, but I didn\'t know who they were. I was approached to take on more from other areas, but I had more than I could cope with."', 'Later, Ted sprayed used guitars, usually when a band wanted to complete a matching set, and these he had to strip completely. The trick, he says, was to get the color right.', "Meanwhile, down at the Jennings factory, in 1963 a young Bob Valentine was busy unpacking, checking, and readying the company's imported Fender instruments for dispatch. When he opened the cardboard boxes they came in, he was met with a unique aroma.", '"I called it the Fender smell. One day I heard that a couple of red Fender Stratocasters had been returned from The Shadows to us, so I asked Tom Jennings if I could buy one. He said yes, and that I could pay for it weekly out of my wages," Valentine says. "I think I paid under £100 for it. Mick Bennett [Vox prototype maker and designer] told me the guitar was Hank\'s, but I wasn\'t that interested who it belonged to. I just wanted a Fender Stratocaster."', 'The Shadows had returned their matched pair of "artist loan" slab-rosewood-board Fiesta Red Stratocasters—which Jennings had given them in 1961—and asked for them to be refinished in white. In the meantime, Hank had given the original Roman Red Strat back to Cliff, and that came in for a white refinish, too.', '"I have no idea where this was done," Hank says. "It might have been through Jennings." In fact, Jennings sprayed a pair of brand new curved-rosewood-board \'63 Strats in white and presented those to Hank and Bruce, while the original Roman Red Strat and Brian Locking\'s slab-rosewood-board Precision both received fresh coats of white paint courtesy of Jennings. (The Roman Red Stratocaster would keep its new white finish for a while, but in more recent years it\'s been refinished more than once by its current owner, Bruce Welch, to a nondescript shade of red.)', 'By the \'80s and \'90s, unscrupulous dealers had coined the term "Selmer refinish" as a way to legitimize almost any refinished early-\'60s Fender guitar. I\'ve personally encountered two one-owner Fenders, with original sales receipts, that were clearly refinished prior to purchase, and I know of others. Evidence indicates that Selmer and Jennings were refinishing brand-new instruments, just as Ted Lee was doing for retailers in and around Manchester, so it\'s time to put this debate to bed.', 'Finally, though, one important note. The highest values placed on custom-color vintage guitars are those that still sport their original paintwork. A resprayed pre-CBS Fender has a lower value than its factory finished counterpart, irrespective of who sprayed it, or indeed when. It takes a highly trained eye to spot the real thing. So, next time you hear the term "Selmer Refin," spare a thought for Ted Lee in his garage in Manchester.', 'About the author: Martin Kelly is author of Fender The Golden Age 1946–1970 and forthcoming books on Vox guitars and Rickenbacker.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

It has been credited as the first amplifier consciously designed for the electric guitar, the first amp manufactured specifically for the rock 'n' roll market, or simply the sweetest distortion generator ever conceived—but whatever the plaudits, there's near-universal agreement that this unassuming little combo can do magical things when hit with the signal generated by steel wires vibrating over an electromagnetic pickup.", 'How unlikely, then, that this raging demon of sweet, succulent tone actually came about out of a collaboration between designer Dick Denney and entrepreneur Tom Jennings, who first became acquainted in the early 1940s while working to supply the munitions that would help Great Britain survive World War II?', "The image isn't very rock 'n' roll, certainly, but that's where this pair first stepped onto the divergent, winding paths that would eventually bring them back together. A brave new venture on the outskirts of a then freshly swinging London of the 1950s would ultimately launch them to the top of the industry, supplying gear for The Beatles, The Shadows, The Kinks, and other world-straddling artists of the British Invasion.", "To fully appreciate the scene onto which the newfangled Vox amps would explode in the late '50s, it helps to take a quick look at the cultural and industrial climates in Britain at the time. Musically, late-'50s Britain was partly distinguished from earlier eras by a reopening of the borders, when restrictive Musician's Union regulations previously imposed on American performers in the UK were loosened in 1957, enabling a major influx of touring artists from the US.", "American rock 'n' rollers like Buddy Holly and the Crickets, Jerry Lee Lewis, Eddie Cochran, Gene Vincent & His Blue Caps, and others toured the UK in the years that followed, and they often brought their amplifiers with them, giving British audiences—and guitarists—a better look at the near-mythical North American electronics than most had ever had before.", 'As such, American music continued to have an impact on the British scene, but that scene had itself grown strong enough to withstand a total stylistic overhaul in the wake of this would-be cultural imperialism. Rather than transforming what was happening in the UK, American music was absorbed into it, and a distinctly homegrown style and sound emerged as a result.', "Just as the British music scene of the late '50s was developing into its own thing, so the British amp industry was on the verge of busting out in its own right. Such evolutionary leaps are rarely instigated by one person, and certainly there were many significant actors in play at this time, but we might reasonably view the turning point of guitar-amp design and manufacture in the UK as having hinged on one company's hiring of one man.", 'For a full decade before engineer Dick Denney came to join former wartime colleague Tom Jennings in 1957, however, the legendary proprietor of Jennings Musical Instruments (JMI) was essentially an innovator in search of an instrument to service.', 'In the postwar United States, the guitar was creeping toward center stage in popular music, but it was definitely still a less-popular instrument in the UK at the time, relegated to thumping along in the rhythm section of larger dance orchestras, or accompanying folk singers in coffee shops and other small venues. Meanwhile, horn sections and pianos had been central to the British bands that had both entertained the troops and maintained morale on the homefront, and the accordion had been extremely popular, too, as an instrument that could provide a lot of sound from a portable package.', 'After serving in the Royal Mechanical and Electrical Engineers Corps during the first two years of the war, Jennings was dismissed in 1942 with what was then called "shell shock" (what we know today as post-traumatic stress), and went to work at the Vickers munitions factory in Crayford, Kent, southeast of London.', 'Wartime efforts aside, Tom Jennings was also a keen accordionist, and the instrument was the cornerstone of his venture when he opened his repair shop at 119 Dartford Road, Dartford, Kent, just after the end of the war in 1946. Having begun by repairing accordions and other musical instruments, Jennings quickly segued into selling them, while the British music scene began evolving rapidly around him.', 'Midway through 1950, Jennings placed his business at the heart of the London musical-instrument community by opening a retail shop at 55 Charing Cross Road, which he soon moved to larger premises up the road at number 100 toward the end of the year.', "Soon, JMI was marketing a small PA/general-purpose amplifier called the Univox, which was manufactured for them by Henry Weil & Company (later of Fenton-Weil fame, a company that would also make guitar amps). Far more significant to JMI's growth, however, was the Univox J-5 electronic keyboard that soon followed. This monophonic, tube-powered organ became a minor sensation in Britain in the early '50s—and put Jennings' company firmly on the map in the process.", "JMI's own guitar amplifier was still several years out, but the venture got the company deep into electronics manufacturing, and the Univox's success also helped to keep it afloat through the early years. As Jennings and company rolled into the mid-'50s, though, it was clear that the cresting wave of the guitar's newfound popularity was going to keep building, and it made total sense for JMI to jump on and ride it.", "While expanding its range of console organs in 1956, the company also introduced the first two guitar amplifiers that it manufactured itself, the Jennings G5/6 and G1/10, designed by engineer Derek Underdown. And while they bore no resemblance to what would come in just a few years, and didn't yet carry the Vox logo, they convinced JMI that this was a sector worth doing right.", 'If Tom Jennings was the man who founded and propelled JMI as a business, Richard "Dick" Denney was the engineer whose ears, vision, and design talents gave Vox amps their sound. Born in Erith, Kent in 1921, Denney learned to play the guitar at an early age, while also pursuing a hobby in electronics—specifically, amateur radio, which seduced hobbyists by the thousands in the 1930s.', 'These parallel interests worked in conjunction to enable Denney, in his youth, to secure overseas broadcasts of American popular music, and to build DIY tube amplifiers through which to express his passion for the Hawaiian steel guitar. Years later, the same skills would lay the foundations of a groundbreaking career.', 'When ill health prevented Denney from entering military service in 1940, he found work at the Vickers munitions factory in Crayford, Kent, where he would eventually meet fellow music lover—and future boss—Tom Jennings.', 'Legend has it that in addition to meeting and working together, Jennings and Denney played music together while huddling with other employees in Vickers\' air-raid shelters, as German bombers flew the skies of "Bomb Alley." This strip of land ran along the industrial corridor that roughly followed the eastern branch of the River Thames from Dartford, Kent, to London\'s East End (as reported by Jim Elyea in Vox Amplifiers: The JMI Years, History for Hire 2012).', "Jennings and Denney had gone their separate ways after the war, but Denney continued his hobby of designing and constructing guitar amplifiers—one of which was gaining some buzz in guitar circles in the mid-'50s—just as the former's business was seeing a very real need for a competitive product in that field. The early Jennings-branded guitar amps designed by Derek Underdown had helped to get the company into the market, but Jennings wanted something that sounded great, something to lead the pack—and word had it that Denney's creation was something of a phenomenon.", "Jennings and company put out the call to bring Denney into the fold in the autumn of 1957. Initially courted to help the company develop a commercial rendition of a guitar amplifier that he had built in small numbers for himself and a few other players, he would eventually become the British amp industry's most influential designer. Although the brand name Vox had appeared on organ amplification units prior to Denney's arrival at JMI, the start of his tenure there truly delineates the launch of this seminal name in British guitar amplification.", 'Perhaps most significantly, Denney\'s arrival at JMI marks a major pivot away from the use of basic "general-purpose" amplifiers for guitar. These were amps that had been built largely according to general-applications circuits often provided by tube manufacturers to support their products. Instead, Denney forwarded an effort to design and develop amps that were specifically suited to the needs of guitarists, and to the guitar\'s particular frequency range and sonic characteristics.', 'While Dick Denney did borrow from many of the standard applications published by tube makers of the day, he appeared to have a better understanding than any British maker before him of how to apply these circuits toward enhancing the sound of the electric guitar—rather than merely harnessing their power to make the instrument louder. In the course of chasing that higher ideal, he established a voice that is arguably more intrinsically linked to a geographical location—the "British sound"—than any other in the history of popular music.', "According to research by both Jim Elyea in Vox Amplifiers: The JMI Years and David Petersen in The Vox Story, the original rendition of the AC15, initially dubbed the AC1/15, was created out of a preamp designed by Denney. For ease of production, it had an output stage adapted from JMI's organ amplifiers, with chassis layout and design elements facilitated by Underdown. Upon hitting the market in January 1958, the AC1/15—soon just AC15—grabbed immediate attention, but it would be another year or more before its glories had fully disseminated into the scene.", "As a guitarist himself, Denney often carted the AC15 around London clubs for musicians to try out, while Geoff Harris from JMI's organ division also joined in on the promotional effort, as did star guitar instructor Bert Weedon of Play In A Day fame, who was also one of the first customers of the AC1/15. Although they purportedly sounded extremely good, the earliest renditions of the AC1/15 were quite different from the legendary AC15 circuit as it would be known from just a year or two later.", "If they could be compared to anything in existence, these early AC15s somewhat resembled the early-'50s, TV-front Fender Deluxe, with top-rear-mounted control panels, individual tone controls (simple treble roll-off networks) for each of their two channels, and EL84 output tubes rather than Fender's 6V6s. Preamp duties were covered by ECC83s (known as 12AX7s in the US), while a 5Z4 was used for the rectifier. A short-lived Vibravox rendition, the first Vox guitar amp with vibrato, added an ECC82 (12AU7).", "It wasn't until the very end of 1959 and through the course of the following year that the classic AC15 circuit as we would come to know it would begin to emerge. At this time, Denney redesigned his preamp around an EF86 pentode tube in Channel II, which had a thicker and more powerful sound, while also changing the rectifier to an EZ81, and briefly adopting an ECF82 for the vibrato and the mellower Channel 1 preamp gain stage. Midway through 1960, the circuit dropped the odd ECF82 (which would remain in use in the smaller AC10), returning to an ECC82 (aka 12AU7) for vibrato modulation.", 'Add all of this to a pair of EL84 output tubes in cathode bias with no negative feedback, and a relatively large output transformer for an amp of this size at the time, then put a Celestion G12 Alnico speaker or two in the cabinet, and the combination is magical—and in fact nothing short of producing one of the finest-sounding guitar amps ever built.', 'Laden with harmonic overtones even amid edge-of-breakup settings; tight enough for clean pop ballad, jazz, or country playing at reasonable volume levels; and succulently toothsome and dynamic when driven into overdrive, a good AC15 is simply something every guitarist should experience at least once in their playing career.', "As the AC15 settled into its best self, the square-ish, 18-watt combo also gained a reputation as the hot item with many notable British guitarists. Cliff Richard's band The Drifters took up the new Vox amps, as did its new members Hank Marvin and Bruce Welch, shortly before changing their name to The Shadows and launching an extremely successful parallel recording and touring career in their own right.", "Other artists like The Vipers, Wee Willie Harris, Marty Wilde, and Billy Fury were also full-fledged endorsees by late '59, and almost any guitarist who was anyone found an excuse to visit Jennings's Charing Cross Road shop when work brought them to London.", "As its popularity grew in the early years, the AC15 also helped to give birth to British rock 'n' roll proper, which had been badly in need of an amp that could get the job done. When the AC15 first hit the scene, manufacturers were still aiming first and foremost at a politer crowd, the jazz and dance-band musicians who constituted the bulk of working professionals.", "These players rarely had cause to turn an amplifier up beyond its available headroom; the burgeoning rock 'n' rollers who eventually did, though, were rewarded with the sonic glories of what might be regarded as the AC15's finest characteristics. These amps were outstanding distortion generators, and they still are, in the hands of the fortunate players and collectors who covet them today.", "As rock 'n' roll grew more popular, and therefore needed to grow louder to suit the bigger venues that housed the shows, Denney doubled up the AC15's output capabilities to create the AC30 (which itself evolved in design over the first few years of its existence), and Vox amps would continue to propel even more major stars into the spotlight. Denney himself stayed with JMI until Jennings's own departure from the company in 1967.", "By this time, an ill-conceived merger with Thomas Organ in California was badly undermining JMI's business and the veracity of English-made Vox amps in general, by allowing the new partner to manufacture its own inferior Vox-branded amps for the US market while kicking back relatively little of value to Jennings and the parent company back home.", 'The end of the original and golden age of JMI Vox was on the horizon and approaching fast, but Jennings and Denney had already forged a sonic template that would continue to generate stellar guitar tone for decades to come.', "Even after moving through several successive owners, Vox still often produced an AC15 in one form or another. After the brand was acquired by Korg in 1992, the company released a very reputable version of the AC15 that became a standard of sorts for many guitarists seeking the classic British sound in an 18-watt package, although its circuit used ECC83 (12AX7) preamp tubes rather than the EF86 pentode that had been responsible for the famed early-'60s renditions of the amp.", 'In the mid-\'00s, however, Korg came the closest in years to recreating the seminal circuit with its AC15H1TV, a hand-wired version employing the essential EF86 tube, all housed in a \'50-era TV-front cabinet. A descendant of that combo is still offered today, albeit in the even more iconic circa-\'60 fawn "split-front" cab, while the more affordable end of the market is met by the AC15 Custom Head and Combo.', "Alongside these official offerings, it's not hard to find excellent replications of the authentic AC15 sound in the guises of several boutique amps. The TopHat Supreme 16 pairs an EF86 channel and a Top Boost–inspired 12AX7 channel in front of a very AC15-like output stage, while 65amps's original blue-line London 18, Matchless' Nighthawk, and Morgan AC20 Deluxe all owe a major debt to this early British classic.", 'About the author: Dave Hunter is the author of The British Amp Invasion: How Marshall, Hiwatt, Vox and More Changed the Sound of Music—which contains further behind-the-scenes tales of the birth of the British guitar-amp industry—as well as The Guitar Amp Handbook, Amped, and more than a dozen other books on guitars, amps, and related gear.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

breakbeats with just two turntables and a mixer to producers composing pause tape beats with tape decks, rap music has a long and storied history of embracing—while pushing against—the limitations of existing technology.', 'Yet for a culture that has benefited so much from innovating in the face of limited resources, an opaque code of "keeping it real" and a resentment toward anyone who breaks the code has often been pervasive among rap purists. This line of thinking led to many heated debates when Image-Line\'s revolutionary digital audio workstation, Fruity Loops, first came onto the scene. In the late \'90s and early 2000s, devotees of vintage samplers saw the program as an inferior means of production.', 'The software first began taking shape in Belgium during the early \'90s, when Image-Line co-founders Jean-Marie Cannie and Frank Van Biesen hired a 19-year-old developer named Didier "Gol" Dambrin.', "Though Dambrin started out as the mastermind behind first-person shooters like Eat This, he developed the first iteration of Fruity Loops in 1997 after trying other early music software like Hammerhead and Rebirth. Despite Dambrin's interest making a fun program for musicians to mess around with, he never thought his creation would morph into a powerful pattern-based DAW used by many industry behemoths.", '"It hadn\'t started very seriously," he told Noisey in a 2015 interview. "It was absolutely nothing like what it is today."', "Dambrin's bosses also had no idea Fruity Loops would turn into a massive success. When he passed version 1.0 off to them in 1997, they were unsure how to sell it.", '"When he dropped it on our machines it was a simple, MIDI-only step sequencer that we were having trouble placing in our existing product range," Cannie wrote in a history of the company on its website.', "Even still, the company's servers were overwhelmed by enthusiastic downloaders just a few days after the first version of Fruity Loops went up on the website. During this wave of surprising initial support, Cannie and Van Biesen made the decision to give existing customers free updates for life—a generous offer they continue to give to paying clients.", "The popularity of Fruity Loops during product launch gave Cannie and Van Biesen signs of hope, but they had a hard time getting people to buy it instead of settling for a free demo during the DAW's first years of existence. Over time, the program slowly found its footing with a user base of young, eager producers who wanted to make beats, had access to a computer, and couldn't afford a traditional sampler.", 'Pirated versions on peer-to-peer networks like Kazaa also helped the software gain a fair share of users, such as Grammy Award–winning producer Hit-Boy, though it is difficult to formally weigh how much piracy hurt FL Studio (as Fruity Loops would later be renamed) during its formative years vs. how much it helped spread the brand and user base.', 'These days a staunch anti-piracy article exists on the Image-Line website, while Dambrin himself seems to have a much more casual view on the matter.', '"No one should pay for software if they can\'t even buy food, and I assume those that use it seriously enough will end up buying it," he told Red Bull Music Academy in a 2015 interview.', 'Beyond demo and pirated versions of the software spreading through high schools and college campuses like wildfire, the almost immediate use of Fruity Loops on official rap releases helped further signal boost the brand and introduce it to the masses.', '[Listen to a playlist of songs made with Fruity Loops/FL Studio as you read.]', 'Jugga The Bully\'s 1999 effort Hostile Takeover may be the first album to feature beats made exclusively with the software—with CunninLynguists rapper/producer and Oregon/Atlanta native Kno crafting half of the instrumentals using the primitive version 1.2.10. (Click here to see YouTuber Wilizm using this version.) Kno also produced CunninLynguists\' 2002 underground breakthrough Will Rap For Food on Fruity Loops, with the original version of the cut "616 Rewind" dating all the way back to 1998.', 'Fruity Loops version 3.1.1 allowed him to create the beats for the group\'s ambitious 2006 concept album A Piece of Strange, a project XXL recently hailed as "one of the finest hip-hop albums created."', "Right before Jugga The Bully's Hostile Takeover dropped, Jamla Records owner and Grammy Award–winning producer 9th Wonder met Grammy-nominated artist Phonte Coleman and Rapper Big Pooh at North Carolina Central University, eventually leading to the formation of Little Brother. Undeterred by price-prohibitive samplers of the day, 9th produced Little Brother's entire 2003 debut The Listening and several other defining works from his extensive catalog with the software.", 'The Listening earned positive reviews from the likes HipHopDX and Vibe, and—along with his unofficial God\'s Stepson remix album—led to 9th Wonder album placements with some of the biggest names in the industry. He created Jay-Z\'s "Threat" in 20 minutes, earned a slot on Erykah Badu\'s New Amerykah Part One (4th World War) with a five-year-old beat, and won a Grammy for his work on Mary J. Blige\'s The Breakthrough—all in a three-year span, using Fruity Loops as his primary weapon.', "Though some hip-hop purists scoffed when they learned how 9th had constructed the beats on The Listening and beyond, he saw his use of the program as no different than hip-hop pioneers making due with limited resources in the culture's early years.", '"In 1973, when they took all the money out of New York public schools for arts and music, kids [went to] the corner, set up turntables, and threw parties," he told XLR8R in a 2008 interview.', 'As 9th Wonder began to establish himself as an industry presence, Fruity Loops officially changed names to FL Studio in March of 2003 with version 4.0. Despite the change, a large contingent of producers used the original name for many years after the switch.', 'While a bit of company rebranding was taking place, a 12-year-old kid named DeAndre Cortez Way received a demo version of FL Studio from a relative. Now known to the world as Soulja Boy, he started posting songs on SoundClick in 2005 and opened MySpace and YouTube accounts in 2006. By the time he turned 16, he created beats with unbelievable speed and efficiency. "I was doing, like, 10 to 20 beats a week," he told Noisey in a 2016 interview. "Every day when I\'d get home from school, I\'d make a beat."', 'In 2007 Soulja Boy decided to channel his manic beatmaking energy into a more ambitious release than his previous SoundClick and MySpace work. Using nothing but FL Studio stock sounds while working on an unregistered version of the program that had a short trial window, he created his breakthrough hit "Crank Dat" in a matter of minutes.', 'Aided by a low-budget music video, celebrities like Beyoncé and Samuel Jackson filming themselves doing the song\'s trademark dance, and an appearance in HBO\'s Entourage, "Crank Dat" soon became a Billboard chart-topping single that went triple platinum the same year it was released. Much like 9th Wonder, Soulja Boy believes the program gave him an affordable and attainable way to turn his ideas into a tangible piece of music. "It gave access to create," he told Noisey.', '"Crank Dat" may have been an overwhelming commercial success for Soulja Boy, but the song had more than its fair share of detractors. In fact, genre elder statesman Dave of De La Soul defended the young artist during a 2009 concert because the blowback against him had grown so intense.', 'With Image-Line\'s flagship software now armed with a multi-platinum single to hang its hat on, there was a renewed sense of uneasiness directed at the DAW—and the implications of what its popularity might mean for the future of rap music. "Is Soulja Boy the future of production," XXL wondered in a 2007 article. "Or some guy who caught lightning in a bottle with a kitschy rap dance?"', 'Flash forward to 2009, the same year Image-Line introduced FL Studio version 9.0, and a whole new generation of producers found unprecedented levels of success with the program.', 'Among this new wave of FL Studio power-users to emerge in 2009 was a then-18-year-old Suffolk, Virginia native Lex Luger, who obtained a pirated copy of FL Studio from friend and fellow producer Urboyblack.', 'After some time spent mastering the FL functions, Luger produced his breakthrough song "Hard In The Paint" on a laptop while sitting in his dad\'s kitchen, according to this 2011 New York Times profile. Once Waka Flocka Flame transformed his beat into a Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop hit that spent 20 consecutive weeks on the charts, Luger went on to craft hits for Rick Ross, Kanye West and Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, and many others.', '"We\'re part of a whole new generation. A generation of computer kids, the voice of the next young hot producers and our success was made possible by FL Studio," he said in an interview on the FL Studio website.', "Around the time of his initial success, Luger and Atlanta producer Southside formed 808 Mafia while they were signed to Gucci Mane's 1017 Brick Squad Records. Though Luger is no longer a member, 808 Mafia has since turned into incredibly successful production team that features Southside, TM88, DY, MP808, and several others.", "Southside alone has a discography that boasts co-production on several multi-platinum hits and credits with 2 Chainz, Future, Gucci Mane, Young Thug, Kanye West, Jay-Z, and many more. And though he still uses FL Studio, he expressed frustration with Image-Line in recent years for failing to recognize that he, Metro Boomin, TM88, and Sonny Digital helped FL Studio infiltrate the EDM scene and boosted the DAW's overall popularity across many genres.", 'Another prominent member of the 2009 breakthrough was Toronto\'s Boi-1da, who exploded on the scene with "Best I Ever Had" from Drake\'s famed 2009 mixtape So Far Gone, "Over" for Drake\'s platinum debut studio album Thank Me Later, and a lengthy list of hits that exceed the capacity of this article. He continues to innovate and find different ways to add layers to his music while sticking with FL Studio, from sampling windshield wipers on Meek Mill\'s 2011 song "Tony Story" to incorporating a choir and live instrumentation on Nicki Minaj\'s 2012 track "Up In Flames."', 'After creating four multi-platinum singles with FL Studio in the past decade, Boi-1da also co-produced Drake\'s Grammy Award–winning "God\'s Plan" with Yung Exclusive and Cardo Got Wings. Fans streamed the song a mind-boggling 82.4 million times in its first week of release as it went on to become the most-streamed song of 2018 on Apple and Spotify. As of June 2018, "God\'s Plan" is 8x platinum.', 'Both Boi-1da and Cardo Got Wings have since confirmed that they used FL Studio to create "God\'s Plan," though Cardo is hesitant to reveal his secret sauce and the VSTs he used to achieve one of the biggest rap records in years. "Every magician can\'t give their damn tricks out," he told Digital Trends in a 2018 interview. "All I\'ll tell y\'all is you can make anything out of anything. That\'s a fucking fact."', '2011 and 2012 saw yet another new wave of producers change the game with FL Studio, as Atlanta producer Sonny Digital broke onto the scene with YC\'s gold single "Racks." Meanwhile, Los Angeles DJ and producer Mustard scored a 4x platinum hit with Tyga\'s "Rack City" in 2011, started using FL Studio in late 2012, and has used it on hits like Ella Mai\'s "Trip" in the ensuing years. In Chicago, Young Chop scored a major hit with Chief Keef\'s "I Don\'t Like" and became a high demand producer at the young age of 19. All three artists continue to work with some of the biggest names in the biz.', 'Next up was Atlanta\'s Metro Boomin, perhaps the most commercially successful rap producer to use FL Studio. Like many other producers who have made a name for themselves in recent years, he studied the success of his FL Studio forefathers. "I had followed Soulja Boy, and I knew that\'s what he was using," he told Fader in a 2014 interview. "I knew 9th Wonder had used it too, and that a lot of EDM and dubstep was being done through it."', "Since getting his foot in the door through work with Gucci Mane during his junior and senior years of high school, Metro has produced and co-produced an astonishing 15 multi-platinum songs for artists like 21 Savage, Future, Migos, and Big Sean in a matter of five years—often collaborating with the aforementioned Sonny Digital, Southside, TM88, and other members of the 808 Mafia in the process. And as this article goes to print, he's only 25.", 'Surprisingly, the aforementioned list of FL Studio power users only scrape the surface of the vast, varied, and talented group of artists making use of the software today. Aone Beats, Jahlil Beats, Hit-Boy, Young Carter, Swiff D, Mike Will Made It, Vinylz, WondaGurl, and countless others have also become extremely successful and sought-after producers through their use of the program. The incredible feats achieved by star users may seem overwhelming to beginners, but Vinylz took to Twitter in 2016 to demystify his use of the DAW and let people know that its powers can be accessible to anyone.', '"Facts Only," he wrote. "I only know the basics in FL Studio. I don\'t know how to automate. I only have 4 VST plugins. I don\'t mix any of my beats." In other words, it doesn\'t take any special ingredients to make a hit with FL Studio, just a lot of practice and the right work ethic.', 'Image-Line also deserves credit for the ongoing success of FL Studio—its latest incarnation is FL Studio 20.5—along with the celebrated and ever-growing list of power users. They introduced FL Studio Mobile for iOS and Android several years ago, created the ILRemote Midi controller app, and have continually tweaked and evolved their DAW to ensure it maintains a foothold in a very crowded field. Despite other programs like Ableton Live becoming very competitive in recent years, FL Studio continues to endure and succeed.', '"We don\'t have a crystal ball here, but we\'ve seen the number of users grow every year for 15 years now," co-founder Jean-Marie Cannie told Speakhertz in a 2013 interview. "As I mentioned earlier, we can\'t do a lot more than develop our products further and offer them as a free update to existing users."', "Though the software has profoundly altered the landscape of rap and other sample-based/electronic music, helped many producers establish careers and become stars, given access to more potential artists, and helped generate scores of hit records, the program's creator still keeps a level head about the massive success of his invention.", '"To me, it doesn\'t matter whether amateurs or only pros are using it," Dambrin, who left Image-Line in 2015, told Noisey. "All that matters is that some people have made amazing things using FL."', 'If the track record of the people using the DAW is any indication, producers will continue to make amazing things with FL Studio for many years to come. And with the prevalence and popularity of online video, it would be a welcomed addition to see the company producing more tutorials with rap producers like this one with Metro Boomin. Since the genre has played such a significant role in the growth and popularity of the software, it seems only right.', 'About the author: Gino Sorcinelli is the writer, creator, and editor of Micro-Chop, a Substack newsletter that dissects beatmaking, DJing, music production, rapping, and sampling.

Multitimbral instruments, on the other hand, can produce multiple sounds simultaneously, opening up the scope for complex elements to be crafted together in ways that would be difficult or impossible using conventional monotimbral signal paths.', 'Significantly, this allows one person to do what previously had taken many people to do—or, at the very least, what it took many instruments to do. If you want a fat arpeggiated bassline underneath your silky chords without using two synths, you need a multitimbral instrument.', "Back in the '80s and '90s, a synth's multitimbral nature used to be a much-hyped selling point, even when capabilities were relatively meager and expensive. Now multitimbrality is arguably a more powerful feature in synthesis and sound design than ever before, but it's not touted as often. The power of DAWs makes some of the great new functionality found in hardware synths seem limited by comparison. But as you'll read below, there's plenty of reasons to learn about and use multitimbral synths.", "Multitimbrality made its name in the mid-'80s as synthesizers began to gain enough voices—and gain enough control over those voices—to make proper multitimbral synths possible and affordable. But the idea goes back much further.", 'To use a grandiose example, an orchestra could be viewed as a multitimbral instrument. When composers write a piece, they take advantage of the variety of tones contained within the singular structure of the orchestra in order to create their piece. As technology and keyboard instruments progressed, efforts were made to put the tones of many players under the control of one pair of hands.', 'From the 12th century, pipe organs offered multitimbrality, putting control over a great many sound generators into a keyboard instrument, with different timbres to be mixed and matched according to taste and purpose. Mozart called the organ "the king of instruments," hardly surprising considering their vast size and incredible range of sound. Organs could have thousands of pipes—the world record is around 33,000—and elaborate consoles with thousands of switches. The biggest could hit a fundamental note of 8Hz, which is subsonic, but sure to put the fear of god into your bowels.', 'In the early 1900s, symphonic and theater organs were designed to replace entire orchestras, and they could play back complex pieces automatically from paper piano rolls. Before the advent of electronic sound generation, these were simply the best solution that the technology of the time could offer when it came to putting many sounds under the control of one person.', "Electronic organs and their silkier cousins, the string synths, carried these ideas into the '60s and '70s.", 'While a new breed of Minimoog-influenced synthesizers introduced a host of exciting sounds to the world, these were largely monophonic and monotimbral. However, plenty of electronic organs and string synths retained the polyphony, the voice-stacking architecture, and the nomenclature of their pipe-organ ancestors. They could create a richness in sound by combining different tones—and, in some cases, totally different voices—on top of each other.', 'The distinctive keyboard line at the top of "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds" was courtesy of a Lowrey organ with a combination of its sounds that were designed to simulate stringed and struck instruments. And on the famous Solina string synth of this era, the sounds available to combine were contra bass, cello, viola, trumpet, and horn. Not that they really sounded like their namesakes—but the terminology was hinting toward the future.', 'It would be some time before the various branches of electronic instruments were fully realised in one keyboard. The main obstacles to overcome were cost, practicality, and reliability—and millions of dollars were spent trying to create the ultimate complex synthesizer.', "Luckily, it was the '70s, and musicians had big money to spend. Korg's PS-3300 (like three stacked PS-3100s in one synth), launched in '77, was truly a product of its era.", 'It was a beast of a synthesizer, containing a staggering 144 VCOs, 144 VCFs, 144 VCAs, 144 envelope generators, and three bandpass resonator banks. These were divided among three identical blocks, each of which could be individually sculpted and then combined at the final output for some extremely impressive sounds.', "I can honestly say I've never played anything quite like it. For example, the resonator section on each block gave you three bandpass filters, which could be swept and modulated to provide vowel and phasing sounds—something very difficult to achieve with other synthesizers, even today.", "For Yamaha's part, the company had a bit of a trend toward the end of the '70s and into the '80s, putting two of the same thing in one box for their higher-end synths—as evident in the company's CS-30, DX1, and the infamous CS-80.", 'These all effectively had two of the same synth controlled from the same keyboard, with the ability to balance the two sections to taste using a simple slider, or even to output the two voices separately for individual processing.', "When using a dual system such as this, we use the term bitimbral, but it's still effective in creating more interesting sounds than would otherwise be possible. The fact that this feature carried over into several of Yamaha's keyboards implies the engineers knew the value of such a design.", "In the analog domain, along with more voices came more circuits, more weight, and more cost. It's important to remember that when dealing with multiple voices and true polyphony, there is an awful lot of control information needed—and this was early days for even basic microprocessors.", "Analog synths, therefore, remained largely monotimbral or bitimbral through the '70s and '80s, and keyboard players—especially those who didn't have to load their own gear on stage—were happy to surround themselves by great castles of expensive keyboards.", "Through the '80s, advances were made and some amazing analog polysynths were created, but they were largely monotimbral, looking to refine an existing idea. Then along came accessible digital synthesis, and a whole new paradigm was born.", "In 1987, Roland's distinctive D-50 was built around a new kind of engine that combined synthesis with samples, putting multitimbrality at the very heart of its architecture.", 'Patches were constructed by layering together up to four sounds or "partials" and then using a joystick to change the balance between them, a wonderfully new and expressive way to manipulate sound. Partials included traditional synthesis waveforms as well as sampled sounds, setting a template for sound design that\'s still in use today.', "As with Yamaha's DX7, the D-50 captured the attention of many keyboardists of its time and can be heard on everything from Enya and Michael Jackson to the theme tunes for The Simpsons and Star Trek: The Next Generation.", 'It has even experienced something of a resurgence over the last few years following its reissue in boutique form in 2017 as the Roland D-05.', "It's no surprise that Eric Persing, one of the D-50's original sound designers, went on to found Spectrasonics, whose Omnisphere plugin is one of the leaders in contemporary sound-layering engines.", "Just a year later, in 1988, Korg's M1 took the D-50 concept and ran with it. It had what for the time was a huge 4MB memory that contained exotic samples put together by an international team of sound designers, marking the first time a synth had been shipped to all countries with the same presets.", "Again, the onboard samples could be combined with other samples and more standard waveforms for rich sound design—making it possible to do curious things like layer a woman's scream with a blown saki bottle-top and a saw wave. How about a selection of drum kits, too? Suddenly we were back in the world of the quirky theatre organ.", "To top it all off, the M1 had an eight-track sequencer that allowed up to 10 songs to be assembled entirely within the keyboard. This was an incredibly liberating experience for musicians at the time, as it negated the use of recording equipment or an external MIDI sequencer to construct a song. It's no wonder it became the best-selling digital synthesizer of its time.", 'Where the D-50 set the template for sample and synthesis-based synth engines, the M1 was the model for multitimbral workstation keyboards. From this point on, digital reigned supreme and analog went into decline. Cheaper memory and more powerful processors meant that, suddenly, every conceivable sound—and many inconceivable sounds—were in easy reach of most musicians.', "The list of workstations is long and fairly uninteresting, essentially leading us to our current paradigm, the do-it-all DAW. It's not that plenty of workstations didn't sound good. Many sounded great, and they were to be found all over the '90s and '00s hip-hop and R&B classics.", "However, I'm sure I'm not alone when I look at those workstation behemoths and don't feel particularly enamored. They have their place, but as technology has progressed we've seen more interesting synths that use multitimbral techniques to deliver big and complex sounds.", 'Elektron is now synonymous with interesting synthesizer design. Almost all their machines could be described as multitimbral, and their synthesizers especially embrace the idea, often using four identical synth blocks independently or combined.', 'The Analog Keys (and its keyboard-less cousin the Analog Four) have four analog monosynths in one box, and you can play all four voices in unison with totally different sounds on each voice—and each voice can do as much as any modern monosynth. You can create a mono patch with eight oscillators (16 if you include the sub-oscillators and noise generators), four low-pass filters, four multimode filters, eight multimode LFOs, eight envelopes, and three bus effects.', "Elektron's Digitone and Digitone Keys are capable of similarly monstrous sound stacking, but its sound generation comes from a very accessible implementation of FM synthesis.", "Putting one eye on the future, Novation's recent AFX update to its Bass Station II keyboard turns the multitimbral concept sideways. Aphex Twin suggested putting a different sound on every key, rather than loads of sounds on one key, which its monotimbral architecture couldn't handle.", "That allows you to do many things, such as making subtle variations in a sound in order to spice up a performance, or even creating analog drum kits that are spread across the keyboard. It's a fantastic and innovative development that takes advantage of modern processor power, and I do hope it finds its way into more synths.", 'While Elektron and Novation cater to the high-quality-but-affordable end of the market, there are a couple of recent high-end keyboards that are starting to revisit the multitimbral architecture of the D-50, now armed with 2019 processing power and memory.', "Both the Dave Smith Instruments Prophet X and the Waldorf Quantum are designed around sampling and synthesis engines in a thoroughly 2019 fashion. Unsurprisingly, they've been lauded for their sound design potential.", "Both are only bitimbral, but considering the different synthesis engines and huge sound libraries (the Prophet X packs a whopping 150GB of samples), even the potential to stack two patches will give you a massive sound. Many of Dave Smith's designs are at least bitimbral, and this feature has saved me many headaches on stage. The Moog One is admirably tritimbral, as it should be for such a high-end piece, and pretty much out-specs any analog polysynth that came before. It's an exciting time in keyboard land.", "I've covered here the story of mainstream multitimbral synths, but there are a few interesting outliers worthy of your attention.", "Yamaha's TX81Z is an authentic DX engine in a 1u rack and is eight-part multitimbral. I bought mine from a music store in New York, where the owner told me they used them just to fill up rack space.", "Cheetah's MS-6 is a rare beast, but it offers six voices of analog synthesis, all of which can be stacked and detuned.", "Roland's MKS-7 is interesting because it contains the brains of a Juno-106 and a TR-707 in one rackmountable module, amounting to a very cost effective way to get that vintage Roland sound without having to pay today's prices.", "There's also the Roland JV-1080, which offers 16-part multitimbrality and a sound library from yesteryear, including many of the classic D-50 sounds, in a very affordable rack unit. It can still be heard today on records by artists such as Tame Impala.", "While the all-singing, all-dancing DAW has somewhat negated the need for eight or 16-part multitimbral instruments, it's clear that some means to play with and stack different voices is a valuable part of any synth's sound-design capability. A singular signal path can only do so much, and there are great rewards to be found when you try different combinations of sounds.", 'In an age where most of us make music looking at the same machine that we use to watch TV or write emails, multitimbral instruments provide us with a welcome break away from the screen to build complex sounds and compelling starting points. They allow us to really delve into the instrument, to think about sound in an architectural way, and to do all that in a self-contained system.', 'About the author: Tom Furse is a synthesist, composer, and producer, best known for his work with The Horrors.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Famously, it would be The Beatles' last ever public performance. Not quite so famously, his guitar was an unusual model, a new Rosewood Telecaster that he'd recently received from Fender.", 'In fact, it was the fourth Fender guitar that The Beatles had acquired. During their early years, the group hadn\'t owned any Fenders, although George had written to a friend in 1960 that the guitar he "might manage" was a Strat. Instead, he decided to indulge his passion for Gretsch guitars—the brand used by one of his six-string heroes, Chet Atkins—and bought a secondhand Duo Jet, and, later, a couple of Country Gents and a Tennessean.', 'But George didn\'t have to wait too long to get his Fender: in 1965, he and John Lennon each acquired a secondhand Strat for studio use. Two years later, Paul McCartney bought an Esquire. Paul was becoming increasingly confident with six rather than four strings. After all, he\'d started in the group as a guitarist. He soon put the new Esquire to good use, for example playing it for his soaring, concise solo on "Good Morning, Good Morning" during the Sgt Pepper\'s sessions at Abbey Road.', "On stage, though, it was a different story, and the public face of The Beatles remained distinctly Fender-less. This was the image that almost every fan had of the group, and it was an image that troubled Don Randall, the sales boss at Fender. Understandably, he wanted the world's most famous band to be seen to play Fender.", 'At first, Don tried to persuade the group\'s manager, Brian Epstein, to get the boys more visibly into the brand. "It was the only time we ever tried to buy somebody off," Don told me. "I sent a member of my staff to try and buy Brian Epstein off." That plan backfired, and The Beatles continued to be seen on stage with guitars by Gretsch and Hofner and Rickenbacker and the rest.', 'In summer 1968, Don tried again, and this time he managed to set up a meeting with John and Paul at the Apple HQ. He was still interested in getting them to visibly play Fender guitars. Don turned up at Savile Row and found himself sitting down with Paul at a big conference table. Paul turned out to be an animated conversationalist, brimming with ideas. John wandered in with Yoko, later on, and made a somewhat less positive impression on Don.', "Nonetheless, the Fender boss came away happy with a deal to supply the band a pile of Fender gear: a Fender VI six-string bass, some Fender Rhodes pianos, a Fender Jazz Bass, a selection of amplifiers, including a PA system, and the guitar that we're interested in, a Fender Rosewood Telecaster for George.", 'Fender had decided to introduce solid-rosewood versions of its venerable Telecaster and Stratocaster, and Roger Rossmeisl was charged with producing custom prototypes, which the company planned to give to George Harrison (Telecaster) and Jimi Hendrix (Stratocaster) to provide publicity for the planned models.', "Roger had worked at Rickenbacker, designing their most iconic guitars, and moved to Fender in 1962. Roger and Phil Kubicki at Fender apparently made four of the custom Rosewood guitars, two Teles and two Strats, and planned to choose the best of each to present to George and Jimi. Phil had worked at Fender since 1964, and after leaving nine years later he would create in the '80s his extended-E-string Kubicki Ex-Factor basses.", 'The body of the prototype Rosewood Telecaster had a thin layer of maple sandwiched between a rosewood two-piece top and back, with a clear satin poly finish to highlight the beauty of the natural wood, and a two-piece rosewood neck fitted with (what else?) a rosewood fingerboard.', "Roger and Phil selected the best body and neck, assembled and double-checked the guitar, and put it in a case. A courier took it to the airport and flew with it in the seat next to him, delivering it to The Beatles' Apple HQ at the end of 1968, just after the release of the group's White Album.", 'The fate of the other three prototype Rosewood models is less clear. The Rosewood Stratocaster intended for Jimi was completed around April 1970, but for some reason it was never sent to the guitarist, and he died that September.', 'That instrument, the other Rosewood Strat, and the second Tele disappeared, although online chatter suggested that around 2012 a Chicago dealer sold a guitar as the Rosewood Strat that never reached Jimi, and a Rosewood Tele prototype said to have been sent to Elvis Presley went unsold at an auction in 2018.', "Later in 1969, George gave away his Rosewood Tele to Delaney Bramlett of Delaney & Bonnie. Delaney kept the instrument until he sold it at auction in 2003, two years after George's death. It fetched a staggering $434,750, bought by an intermediary for George's widow, Olivia Harrison.", 'As planned, Fender put the Rosewood Telecaster into production later in 1969, and it lasted a couple of years in the line. The rosewood-and-maple sandwich of the body made for an unusual and heavy Tele, and Fender tried to lighten the load by shifting to a modified construction with hollowed chambers inside. However, the weight and unusual tonality of this short-lived model meant it was never a popular instrument.', 'There have been occasional reissues (including a 1985 Made-in-Japan model), and the George-related guitar has been revived a few times in more recent years, including in 2016 a Custom Shop model, the Fender George Harrison Tribute Rosewood Telecaster—announced as a limited edition of 100—and a regular version the following year, the George Harrison Rosewood Telecaster, limited to 1,000 units.', 'Back in January 1969, The Beatles famously staged that last "concert" on the Apple rooftop in London. Ringo played his Ludwig Hollywood kit, Paul his \'63 Hofner bass, John his stripped Epiphone Casino, and George the new Rosewood Tele. All the amps were Fenders. Billy Preston was there, too, playing a Fender Rhodes Seventy Three. It\'s hard to imagine that Don Randall wouldn\'t have allowed himself a satisfied smile for a job well done when he saw the Fender-laden performances in the subsequent movie, Let It Be.', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

With walls painted black—even the inside of the windows were blacked-out and boarded-up to prevent onlookers and slow the inevitable police raids—the bar would stretch far down to your left, where a dancefloor, maybe lit with a spare spotlight, would move with patrons dancing to the hit singles of the day.', 'That the Stonewall allowed gay men to dance with one another was a unique and defining characteristic of the club, one that made it an overnight success upon its opening on March 18, 1967.', "Even in 1960s' New York City, homosexuality was all but illegal. Bars could not serve alcohol to homosexual patrons, dancing and other public displays of affection were prohibited, and the only people that risked running gay bars were Mafiosi. The Stonewall Inn too was run by the Mafia—and was regularly raided by police.", "But in between such disturbances, the Stonewall's permissive atmosphere attracted a loyal cast of regulars and a more diverse clientele than other gay bars of its time; while there were many masculine-presenting gay men, there were also drag queens, more effeminate queer youth, and a smaller number of lesbian and transgender patrons. There were also more white people than other races and ethnicities, but black, Puerto Rican, and other Latinx people were common as well.", 'While demographic breakdowns of the clientele have been debated and disputed over the years, the Stonewall maintained a reputation for being freer, more inclusive, and, simultaneously, more rough-around-the-edges than the more upscale gay bars nearby. The scene outside the club on Christopher Street, which was home to many young runaways, could be raucous.', 'According to recollections in David Carter\'s Stonewall: The Riots That Sparked the Gay Revolution, the jukeboxes that fueled the dancing were "stocked with singles, which could be played for ten cents a song or three for a quarter." Like the watered-down drinks (priced at $1 a piece), the cigarettes, and the more illicit substances available, the selection of jukebox singles was also courtesy of Mafia supply chains.', 'The songs that were regularly spun in June 1969, according to the Stonewall Veterans Association (SVA), included Jerry Butler\'s "Only the Strong Survive," Marvin Gaye\'s "Too Busy Thinking About My Baby," The Ronettes\' "You Came, You Saw, You Conquered," and other Motown soul and pop songs. In a nod to both the Mafia employees\' favorite crooner—and an oddly yet appropriately subversive track for the Stonewall atmosphere—the June jukebox also included Frank Sinatra\'s "My Way."', 'Even at their most spirited, the songs that received constant rotation in June 1969 don\'t, on their own, portend rebellion. Sly & The Family Stone\'s "Stand!"—while fairly light and poppy in its production—gets closer than most at putting some words to the era\'s demands for civil rights:', "Stand! For the things you know are right.\nIt's the truth that the truth makes them so uptight.", 'Diana Ross & The Supremes\' "The Young Folks," also addresses youthful revolt within the confines of a lilting pop rhythm:', "Here's the deal, accept it if you will—\nThey're comin' on strong, it's their time to live.\nMy old friend, I thought you knew by now:\nYou gotta make way for the young folks.", 'There were plenty more songs that instead had winking lyrics, like Connie Francis\' "Follow the Boys" (a sample line: "I\'ll follow the boys, wherever they go, I\'ll follow the boys, \'cause in my heart I know") and "Where the Boys Are" ("Where the boys are, someone waits for me"). These songs, respectively, opened and closed out many nights at the Stonewall, according to the SVA.', 'But deeper within the club there was a back room, a smaller bar area one step up from the main floor, even more dimly lit. And in here, there would congregate the younger, edgier street kids, who wanted to listen to harder soul music like that of Otis Redding, Carla Thomas, and artists similar to these early Stax legends.', '"The back room, with its more soulful music, made up in spirit whatever it lacked in size. Its lively feeling derived from its being the favored place of the homeless youth, as well as of young blacks and Puerto Ricans," writes David Carter in Stonewall. "Always crowded, the younger and the \'in\' crowd claimed the back room as their domain. The back room\'s flagstone floor gave it an advantage for energetic dancers."', 'The music, the youthfulness of the patrons, and the free atmosphere combined into a heady mix of personal acceptance, release, and rebellion, according to Stonewall regular Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt.', '"The music is carrying the articulation of this emotional need that can\'t be articulated on the outside publicly. You picture a bunch of kids and the towns they came from: They hear the songs on the radio, Diana Ross or The Shangri-Las, and the way they relate to it is they identify it as someone of their own sex, but they\'re not telling anyone," he says in Stonewall. "At the Stonewall, all these kids who had to hold this inside in high school can now articulate this completely."', 'In this mix, even lighter fare about long-lost lovers took on greater significance. When speaking of the song "Forget Me Not," a song sung by a female character sending her lover off to war, Lanigan-Schmidt explains how he and others could read their own love stories into those lyrics, and acknowledge it together.', 'To have had a similar affair, as brief as it may have been, "and then come to a place and be able to dance that into a song was a major innovation at the Stonewall, because it wasn\'t happening anyplace else," he says.', 'In the early hours of June 28, 1969, this expansive sense of freedom would, once again, be abruptly cut short at the Stonewall Inn with a raid by the NYPD.', "The procedure at that point, more than two years into the club's life, was well-known. On any normal raid, the lights would flicker, most of the Mafia employees would disappear, the one-and-only front door would open to swarming officers, and a handful of patrons would be arrested for the evening.", "The Stonewall's owners, like their peers, regularly paid off police. Even during raids, they were often in close-contact with officers, just going through the motions until they could resume business again hours later.", 'But the oppression that night reached a breaking point with the bar crowd and those congregating outside on Christopher Street. At first, the air was jovial, with a campy rendition of "We Shall Overcome" being sung by the crowd. But soon, set off by the cops\' attempts to push various drag queens, lesbians, and other patrons into a paddy wagon, some of those being arrested and members of the crowd began to fight with police.', 'The rebellious actions that first night and spontaneous bouts of street fighting over the course of the next week—many led by trans women of color and effeminate men—would come to be known as the Stonewall Riots. Like the articulation of private desires found inside, the Stonewall patrons demanded the same freedom out on the streets.', 'Participants and leaders like Marsha P. Johnson, Zazu Nova, and Sylvia Rivera would form new activist groups like the Gay Liberation Front, bring new life into older gay rights organizations, and set a fire under the LGBTQ organizing still ongoing today.', 'Looking back at Stonewall in 2019, Lanigan-Schmidt, the former street kid regular and now renowned artist, still places great importance on the music and the dancing the pre-dated the rebellion. "It was the dancing together, being able to hold each other, that made Stonewall so special," he told Artforum in a post for 2019 article.', '"One of my favorites was \'Third Finger, Left Hand\' by Martha & the Vandellas, a 1967 song that was about hoping for a wedding ring, but if you count the fingers, the third finger could also be your middle finger. So we would all dance with each other while flipping off the outside world."', '', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

(Linn has no recollection what became of it.) Still, you could say the Linn LM-1 Drum Computer was a gift-wrapped box of creativity for another young inventive genius, one Prince Rogers Nelson.', "As the cornerstone of Prince's soul-funk-rock-cosmic funhouse, the LM-1 guaranteed that his music would stand apart from that of his contemporaries. Not that this secret weapon came cheap; when Linn introduced it in 1979, he priced it at $5,000. Only 525 were ever made, and used LM-1s were just about impossible to find when Prince landed one—meaning he likely paid the equivalent of $17,600 (plus tax) in today's money to get it. Even now, when a rare original model pops up on Reverb, one can go for anywhere between $4,000 and $10,000.", 'Yet given the hits the Artist coaxed out of its sliders, knobs, buttons, and chips, his LM-1 goes down as one of pop music\'s best gear investments. And as the LM-1 supercharged his career, Prince propelled the modern drum machine into the spotlight. Other artists—including Peter Gabriel, Stevie Wonder, and Michael Jackson—would all make amazing music with the gadget; the Human League\'s 1981 smash single "Don\'t You Want Me" compelled countless music fans wonder, "What\'s that sound?"', 'Prince, though, made the LM-1 such an integral part of his music that it\'s impossible to imagine his most beloved songs without it. Where others might be just as happy using some other drum simulator, Prince played his LM-1 like a man possessed, as though mounting and mangling a real drum kit. "Drum machine aficionados regard Prince as some sort of Hendrix of the LM-1," the Guardian proclaimed in 2009, an apt description if ever there was.', "Just how did Prince turn pop music's first sample-based drum machine into a magic box? While notoriously secretive about his studio techniques, Prince did leave behind clues as to how he doctored the LM-1 to create his own percussive planet.", '"Real drums at your fingertips." That was how Roger Linn advertised the LM-1 in the product\'s brochure. That said, it makes a huge difference whose fingertips we\'re talking about here, and Prince wasn\'t content to touch a few of the 46 buttons and get out of the way. For him, the motto might as well have been "Real drums with your fingerprints." Prince left his marks all over the machine by putting it through paces Roger Linn never intended, but still marvels at to this day.', '"Prince\'s hits made such an impact because of his creative use of the LM-1," Linn told me in a 2017 Reverb interview. "I tried to contact Prince a couple of times but never heard back. He was very important to my success."', "Unlike other artists who merely programmed a simple beat and let it repeat as-is, Prince manipulated the LM-1's preset sounds, aggressively finger-drummed patterns and fills, and—as you'll read more about below—used the machine's individual and stereo channel outputs to run the one-shots and patterns through effects.", '"He didn\'t just select a stock beat and press play, but rather used it in unusual and creative ways, from his detuning the drums to no longer sound like drums, to the unusual beats he programmed, to how he featured it in the mix," Linn said.', "Not even Linn knows exactly how Prince did his thing, and even those closest to him seem to have spotty recollections. This has led to some wide speculation online from fans and modern-day producers still hoping to learn the secrets of Prince's use of the LM-1. But here, we've reconstructed a roadmap into some of his trademark sounds and songs, hoping we've gathered enough intelligence to recreate his realm of purple percussion.", "This much we know: Price was not a gearhead. A remarkable guitarist, he utilized fewer than a dozen stompboxes over his career, more than half of them stock Boss pedals. Nor—despite rumors discussed on forums—is there any evidence that Prince went under the hood of his LM-1 to perform any hardware modifications, at least not at the time of his most famous '80s recordings.", 'One other pesky forum topic to address: Prince did own and sometimes use the next iteration, the LM-2 LinnDrum, which allowed players to swap in new sounds thanks to EPROM chips. However, even with some more advanced features, the LinnDrum did not allow for the same fine-tuning of all of its hits, nor did it have the peculiar internal swing to its sequencing that Prince preferred. "He tried the LinnDrum when it came out, but he didn\'t like that one," Prince\'s engineer Susan Rogers told TapeOp in 2017.', "Thus he started with the same foundation as any other LM-1 owner, a library of one dozen tunable sounds: two congas, two toms, snare, bass, hi-hat, cowbell, claps, rimshot, tambourine, and cabasa (but no cymbals, alas). The 8-bit samples of real acoustic drums and percussion were performed by Linn's friend, drummer Art Wood (making Wood, you might say, a default member of Prince's rhythm section).", "But with one foot firmly in a guitar player's world, Prince mixed his pedals with the Linn in a way its inventor never envisioned. Thus what Prince did to those sounds once they left the LM-1's metal chassis made his use of it so special.", "Of those closest to Prince in the studio, Rogers—Prince's trusted engineer that stayed virtually by his side for five years, beginning with the Purple Rain sessions and continuing to 1988—offers the best glimpse into how he captained the LM-1. Aside from her integral role at the board, she's wicked smart: Rogers now holds a Ph.D. in psychology and is a lauded researcher in music cognition and psychoacoustics.", "As part of her first gig at Prince's service, she installed an API console at his downstairs home studio, located in his split-level ranch home (repainted purple, natch) in suburban Minneapolis. Like Prince and Linn, she was in her 20s at the time (just 27).", "In a 2016 interview with iZotope, Rogers recalled why the LM-1 became Prince's go-to drummer in a can:", '"Prince liked it because on the back of it there were individual outputs for every individual sound, and there was a tuning knob for each individual sound. You could individually tune every drum that you wanted."', 'Then... enter Prince the guitar god.', '"He liked to take a percussion mix that would come out of the output of those little faders and run it through his Boss effects pedals. So, let\'s say for example, the hi-hat, cymbals, cabasa, and claps might all be running through a Boss pedal where we could add distortion. We had that heavy metal pedal, the brown one. He had the orange distortion pedal, and the delay, the blue one."', "Of course, it's easier to remember colors than names. So based on Rogers' descriptions, photos of Prince's pedalboard, and the little bits Prince disclosed about his gear, this is likely the selection of pedals Prince used to doctor the LM-1:", '"We would take his Boss pedalboard from his guitar rig and just plug it into the output of the drum machine and we could send claps, or snare or toms usually, and hi-hat, whatever we liked through this mixture of the Heavy Metal pedal and the Flanger and the Chorus and the Delay and the Distortion," Rogers told Red Bull Music Academy in 2016. "Dialing in on the pedalboard—dialing in the sound for the percussion—was one of the tricks that he invented and that others copied in his work."', 'Prince also owned a Dunlop Cry Baby wah-wah and Rotovibe, the former used to occasionally accent his LM-1 (see below).', 'Given the LM-1\'s standalone place in the final mix—the only accompaniments for most of the song are vocal and keyboard—"When Doves Cry" is one of the easier songs to deconstruct. Much has been made of a hollowed-out sound at the song\'s opening, which has even earned its own nickname among Prince fans: the "doorknock."', 'Linn told The Current in 2017: "That was merely a recording of what\'s called a cross-stick snare drum, which is a snare drum stick where you hold the tip onto the drum head, and you slap the stick against the rim of the drum. He just used that normal sound, but he decided to tune it down about an octave or more to get what you refer as the \'knocking\' sound."', 'While you\'ll find LinnDrum aficionados remarking that the knocking must have come from the LM-2 (which certainly contains a similar sound), in this interview, Linn was discussing the LM-1. "He did the same thing with the tambourine. He turned it into this loose jangling thing that didn\'t sound like a tambourine at all. These became characteristic sounds on his records, so then, of course, a lot of folks stole them," Linn said.', 'With bonus points for its purple paint job, the Boss BF-2 Flanger became an A-list pedal for Prince to change the LM-1\'s tone. On "Doves," listen for the narrow-band, constricted flanging painted on to the tom accents. While distinctive, the texture is so subtle that it\'s tough to pick out which drum triggers it as it darts in and out. (That Flanger, a favorite, can also be heard on the drums of "If I Was Your Girlfriend.")', 'Note also that Prince\'s guitar freakout in the "Doves" intro makes generous use of the Boss OC-2 Octaver. Given how ferociously fast Prince worked in the studio, it\'s possible he picked up what was already out and treated the LM-1\'s kick drum with just a touch of OC-2. (Low octaves also figure into Prince\'s vocals.)', 'Another Prince trick that may have figured into this song involved the British-made AMS RMX16 digital reverb. Prince loved to run the kick drum through its reverse tube program and the AMS patch was definitely used on another Prince hit without bass, "Kiss" (though there is some debate whether the LM-1 or a Linn 9000 was used).', 'The song "1999," from the 1982 album of the same name, features The Revolution and drummer Bobby Z, with LM-1 drum fills (note the consistent attack, cascade, and beat sequence) populating the verses and chorus. Listen closer and you will hear the Cry Baby adding stabs of wah to the Linn and live drums. In places where you detect thickening delay, know that Prince was fond of tight settings of about 150ms, which may have come from a Boss DD-3.', 'On "The Ballad of Dorothy Parker," it may sound at first blush as though Prince just lets the LM-1 do its thing, unadorned of any effect. As on "When Doves Cry," a basic loop anchors the rhythm and the song stunningly recalls stripped-back, "Family Affair"-era Sly Stone. But underneath the minimalist throbbing, Prince applies distortion (probably the Heavy Metal or Boss DS-2) to tom accents and doubles the attack of kick drum hits with wobbly synthesizer chords. (You can also hear a propulsive, double-kick pattern he played ferociously by hand on "Darling Nikki.")', "Prince and his LM-1 made for a remarkable marriage of computerized technology and creative mastery. If you believe in synchronicity, it's entirely possible that he and Linn connected on some unseen levels: two twenty-something guitar players, both geniuses with creative minds wrapped around ways to change the role of rhythm in pop music.", 'If the spiritual angle sounds like a stretch, consider these final words from Linn and the Purple One that cross over with as much soul as a kick and snare locked in transcendent rhythm:', 'Prince in a rare Guitar Player interview: "You have to respect your spiritual base. You have to respect the instrument. The volume and tone of an instrument are so important."', 'Linn, recalling a magazine article he saw years ago: "It showed a picture from his Paisley Park studio, in Minneapolis, of his original LM-1 Drum Computer, and it had a lamp on it. It was like a shrine."', "On perhaps a more practical if no less astonishing level, Prince's precise tailoring of individual drum sounds was a harbinger of our age of contemporary pop rhythm production.", "Today's DAW-based producers will think nothing of tinkering over each hit of their kicks, snares, and claps—pitch-shifting and effecting individual drum tracks until they sound exactly as they wish. Prince brought to bear that same exacting tonal perfection with the relatively crude instruments of his time, committing the drum sounds he heard in his head to tape with just the LM-1's own pitch knobs and his Boss-filled pedalboard.", "Maybe it was just the Purple One's personal taste, perhaps it was prescience, but pop rhythm creation followed in his steps.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

He'd be designing, and working—fretting, spray-painting, whatever. He'd work in the shop.", 'He was responsible for some of the designs.', "Oh yeah, for a lot of the designs we still have today. If Francis Hall [then boss at Rickenbacker] wanted something, Roger would try to come up with it. He'd put it on paper, a small sketch of it, and try and come up with something.", 'Did Roger change much in himself during those four years you worked together at Rickenbacker?', "Oh, I don't know. I think he had a lot of personal problems. I know he drank a lot, quite heavy. A lot of personal trouble.", 'Did that affect his work?', "No, Roger was good. Maybe later on. I never saw the man drunk or anything. I think he told me it was '53 he started, and he left here in August in '62—we'd just moved down from LA to Santa Ana in June or July, and he stayed on for two months, then went to Fender. He knew he was going to Fender when we moved, he'd bought a home up there already. I think he was about 47 at that time.", "How many people were working alongside you and Roger, when you joined in '58?", "Oh, we only had a small amount of people, I'd say between six and eight—I don't know exactly.", 'Did Semie Moseley work at the company at that time?', 'He left the company just a very short time after I was there, maybe a month after I was with the company. He and Paul Barth both left.', "So in '62, the Rickenbacker factory moved from LA to Kilson Drive in Santa Ana, a stone's throw from the sales office of Radio-Tel, Francis Hall's distribution company. Was that a good move for the company?", "Yeah, I think so. I wanted to get out of LA. This place [Santa Ana] was real small at that time, and I liked the country. No freeways about at that time. I really liked it. It's changed a lot. This here [Rickenbacker's current factory and offices at East Stevens, on the corner of South Main] was a drive-in restaurant—we used to come down here and eat our lunch.", "Did the move in '62 result in changes to production methods?", "No, we brought the equipment down with us. I was doing the same things in both places. I'm doing the same thing now, basically [laughs].", "Were Rickenbacker's large-body F-suffix models under way by the time you joined, the ones with the controls mounted on the front?", 'Yeah, and I remember we had some problems with those cracking around the front of the instrument, around the heel near the body. And to get those controls in, we had a tool to put them in there and pull them through. It was a standard tool, and we had to just pick it up like a surgeon would and pull the control up through the hole—and then, obviously, put the nut on. The hole was probably two inches or so in diameter, under that big pickguard, put there specially for that, because there was no hole in the back.', "What prompted the Rickenbacker 12-string? There weren't many electric 12-strings then.", "We brought it in somewhere around '64, and Mr. Hall, he wanted a 12-string, but he wanted the head short, a compact head, he didn't want six keys and another six keys. He said could we come up with a configuration to make it not much bigger than a regulation six-string head. So I drilled around, and I came up with what we've got today.", "It's a great piece of design, Dick. You have the six regular tuners, three on each side of the head, and then you added two parallel routed channels in the headstock face—like the slots on a classical guitar, but not going all the way through—with the second set of six tuners at 90 degrees to the first, the keys facing backwards. Did it take you long to get to that?", "I was head of the woodshop at that time, and we worked it different ways. We thought about putting the rout all the way through, in fact I think I made a couple with the rout all the way through. I think it looked better without it. We ended up with a rout about an eighth of an inch in. If you can see through it, I don't know, it doesn't look as good. But I'm not a musician.", 'Why did you incorporate the classical-style head into your design? Were you looking at those kinds of guitars?', 'No. I mean, I knew what a classical guitar was from the side. But if you wanted a short head, you had to come in from the side some way, you had to mount them a different way, you know?', "So it wasn't the influence of classical guitars that made you do it that way?", "Well, yeah, you know—you see something and it sticks with you, definitely. I was going to go all the way through, like a classical, with the first one we made, but then we came up with one with a back on it. It didn't take very long to come up with it, you know [laughs].", 'What effect did it have on the company when The Beatles used Rickenbackers—John his 325, George his 360/12, and Paul his 4001S bass?', "We started getting busy! We got a lot of interest from The Beatles, definitely. Pretty good for the company—they played those instruments, and liked them, I guess. I think that the 320 took off, and our basses took off, in the mid to late '60s. The 12-string went good, too.", 'Who came up with Rickenbacker\'s classic "R" tailpiece, which you introduced around 1963?', 'Well [laughs] I\'ll tell you, we copied that from the Washington Redskins. Do you know the football team? We saw that R there on their hats, an R for Redskins, and we copied that. That\'s where we got it from! It looks good, so we came up with that. You\'re familiar with the trapeze tailpiece? Well, they wanted a new tailpiece, and "R" went with "Rickenbacker," obviously. I just remember seeing the Washington Redskins\' R and it looked good, the way that tail of the R came up. So we just copied it from there [laughs].', 'Do you remember the Astro Kit guitar? It was a kit of parts to make an electric guitar, which Rickenbacker sold at Christmas 1963.', "Yeah, it was designed by a guy named Marvin Boyd. He came with the company in '62, when we moved to Santa Ana from LA. He worked with us for a little while, maybe a year or so, then he moved to Missouri, maybe Mississippi—one of the two, I can't remember. He would have left in '63 or '64. Those kits, we made a few with no lacquer or anything on them, and then we made some complete, we painted the bodies red and blue, and sold them, too.", 'How about the new rounded-edge body style, which came along in 1964 or so?', "I guess some musicians complained about the sharp edge on the double-bound [sharp-edge] one, and Mr. Hall wanted something maybe more rounded, so we came up with that. It's more comfortable for the player. When we first came up with it, it didn't look good, in fact it looked awful—because we didn't bind the f-hole. When we bound the f-hole, it sets it off. If you take that binding off the f-hole it just doesn't look right.", 'Tell me about the differences in production for the sharp and the rounded one.', "We just shape the top of it, for the rounded type, instead of putting the binding groove in and binding it, and the horn is rounded off more—that's all. But you take from the horn back, everything's the same, except for knocking the horns off. They do look completely different.", 'You start with the same body?', 'Right, we have a jig that can shape that side. We can cut blanks off and make them anything we want, long as you put them in the right jig. We start with a solid block, cut the different lengths, join them together, then set overnight. Lay them out, put them through the rim sander. Then we have jigs to shape them and flip them over, eat the insides out, put in the control pocket, the f-holes, the neck slot. Next we do the back on it. Then we put the binding on, or the carved top, and put the binding on the back of all of them.', "The necks come separate, but the same neck goes in either—what I call the regular [rounded] 360 or the OS [Old Style, sharp-edge]—they're interchangeable. Same pickups, same bridges, everything else.", "Has that process changed since you've been here?", "No, I don't think so. The same way. We don't have much cracking, nothing like that, which is good. And in the factory, well, we now have humidifiers in here and stuff, which helps. We had trouble with paint here in Southern California one time, too. But we've been pretty lucky, we haven't had any big troubles. The main thing is, somebody makes a mistake, we catch it before it gets out.", 'You mentioned soundholes just now—did the real f-holes of the \'60s export models for Rose-Morris and others mean much of a change in production, from the regular Rickenbacker "slash" hole? Did you make many of the f-hole type?', "No problem: it was the same instrument except for the f-hole. Same fittings, same jig, all you have to do is change that pattern. You've got three or four screws to change. I remember some time, maybe '63, there was an order for about 50 of them—the 330, not the bound-top model 360—and they wanted the f-hole. We went into the 12-string a year or two later, and they ordered quite a few of them, too. Then that f-hole more or less went dormant, it seemed, until we started to make the Pete Townshend limited edition in 1987. I like that better than our regular soundhole, myself.", 'I wonder why Rose-Morris chose to have that?', "I think Lennon or one of them had one with an f-hole, and the Rose-Morris guy saw that, but I'm not sure. I think they may have sent us a picture or something how they wanted it. But we did put out some of the short-scale 320s with that, almost but not quite the same.", 'How about the lightshow guitars, with the clear body and triggered lamps inside?', "We had a little trouble with that [laughs]. We had a plexiglass bottom and top, and then we came up with the silver underneath it, so when you played you could see the light. After we figured it out, it wasn't any trouble, it was easy. Had a little thicker body, if I'm not mistaken. That was something completely different!", 'Also around 1970, you changed the width of the triangle inlays on the deluxe models. Why was that?', "Yes, we changed the inlay from all the way across to midway, and we did that because it makes for a stronger neck—especially on a 12-string—when the inlay doesn't go all the way across. If you take that wood out, you weaken that neck all the way across there.", 'What prompted the slant-fret guitars, which I think you made a few of around 1971?', "Some musicians said that's the way when you hold the neck in your left hand—your hand is slanted. So we put the slanted frets in a few guitars. I don't know how many, maybe a hundred or two—I don't recall. We had everything set up the same, and the only thing that was any different was the fretboard, just cut at an angle. The pickups and the bridge sat at an angle, too. Other than that, everything's the same. I remember making some slant-frets with ebony fingerboards, but most of them were made with the regular rosewood.", 'Do you recall whose idea it was to make the "bass body" 480-series guitars in the early \'70s?', 'Well Mr. Hall again [laughs], he wanted an instrument that looked like the 4001 bass at the time. That was very simple, because it was just about a copy of the bass, but it had a six-string neck in it. I believe, from memory—and this was a long time ago—that the bass was very popular and it would look good if you had a guitar that was similar. I guess he felt it might sell the instrument with the bass.', "It was around that time, early '70s, that you began to make double-necks for the first time.", "The 4080, they called it, and the 362/12. You had to make sure everything lined up, that was the main thing with those. The 362 was pretty easy, it was just an oversized 360, basically—through necks is all. Most of the 4080s had that bass neck on there, and the pickup came off different spots and the bridge was in a different position. And that 4080 neck was on an angle, if you recall, and the bass neck stuck right out, which I didn't like.", "They said it played good because you have that neck kind of backwards. I don't play, but they said it was a good instrument on account of that relationship. We put out small runs of those, 10 at a time, 15 at a time. I don't know how many times we did that.", 'What would be the regular number for a run?', "Oh, it depends what period you're talking about. When we were busy, we might run a couple of hundred, for a two- or three-week production, before we started on something else. Like the 360/12 was real strong in the mid-'60s there, and I remember it seemed like that was all we were seeing, the 360/12 coming out. I think in the late '70s and early '80s, it was maybe 90 percent basses at that time.", 'What period was the factory most busy?', "I would say maybe in the late '60s, or mid-'60s—1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, something like that. At one time, we had 103 people at the factory, but I can't be sure if that was in the late '60s or maybe some time in the '70s. We got low, too. I know when we landed on the moon, that was 1969, we were slow—we were slow in 1969, 1970, and 1971, and we had, oh, seven or eight people. We'd go for a couple of years and then we'd pick up again.", "How did Rickenbacker's sales hold up in the '70s?", "Well, we put out a ton of basses in the '70s. In the '60s, it had been the 320, the 12-string, and the 360.", "What about more recently, say in the '80s?", "We were slow at the beginning of the '80s but we started picking up in about '84, and it's been going good since [speaking in 1993]. Now we have about 60 people. This is probably the longest I've ever seen it steady. It's real good, nine or 10 years now, whatever it is.", "Were you involved in the redesign of Rickenbacker's double truss-rod in the early '80s?", "Yes. I thought the old truss rod wasn't as good as we make them now. The old type, when you tighten the rod up, the top part of it goes up and the bottom part appears to go down a little bit, so it seems like you're pushing and a-pulling. And those fingerboards used to pop off a lot, too.", "The way they're made now, we never get one back. Now it's just one double-rod in there, not two. It starts off from the beginning at the back, and it dips a little bit, the eighth fret is its lowest point, and it comes back up again. You've got a little U in there, and when you tighten the rod, it goes up, and it adjusts pretty good. It's the same steel material, it's just shaped a little differently. The old rod was more or less flat, and this is oval, and probably a little bit smaller, but you can adjust the neck probably three times as much with it.", 'Are most things today [speaking in 1993] made in the factory here?', 'We buy all the metalwork, obviously, the rods and stuff. We make the instrument complete here, except for the machine heads. We make our own pickups, but we buy all the parts and assemble them here. The metal people make our pickup covers, the plastic people make the parts like the coil-form, and we put them together.', "You're factory manager now, Dick. Is that the way it's always worked here, a factory manager and people below him?", "I've been called other things. I check things at different stages. We have a paint guy, a woodshop guy, you've got your buffing people, people at the sander, and there's a lead person in each of the departments. There's paint, woodshop, buffing, wet sanding, and then number 30 sanding, where we sand the instruments before they go into the paint room. So about five. Basically that's the way it's always been.", "When I started, we didn't really have departments, we had pretty much one big-size room for the woodshop, and we basically did everything in there. We had a paint room. But we would make it, hand sand it in the woodshop, then paint it in the paint room, bring it out and wet sand it right in that woodshop. We buffed it in a different spot, at the front. But everything else was done in the same room. Now we have different everything.", 'Are there more machines to do things now?', "We didn't have a drum sander back then—that puts the different thickness on the wood, takes the glue off, makes things a lot easier. We've got four routers now, and we only had one then. We've got two or three edge sanders, and again, we only had one back then, things like that. Two or three joiners.", 'Do you think there are parts of guitar-making that will never be automated?', "I think you can get a machine to do it just as good. But your wood does move, and if you let it set for a period of time, it could change a little bit on you. We glue the wood up in three pieces, like our necks, let it set for a long time. We got walnut and two pieces of maple—they can go on you. We let it set for a long time, paint it, see which way it's gonna go. We've had real good luck with our necks.", "I guess you've used the same kinds of woods over the years.", 'Yes, mainly Eastern hard maple, walnut, and rosewood for the fingerboards, mainly the same things.', 'Has the source of the rosewood changed?', "They had that trouble bringing it into the United States, you remember that [speaking in 1993]? I think it comes from Africa now. Padauk looks a little bit redder, had a bit different character, if you know what you're looking for.", 'Has it become harder to get quality woods?', "Well, sometimes we have trouble when they get to just before they harvest the next crop. It can be hard to get in the width we need—we probably need about eight inches for a lot of our instruments. But we can always make necks out of it, or could make a 600 Series or 4000 Series—it doesn't go to waste. And we do get pretty good wood. If it's birdseye maple, you pay a lot of money for it, but we've got some pretty good-looking birdseye, if you pay the price for it. We get the best maple you can find, regular maple, about 30 cents a foot. It's mainly from the northeastern United States.", 'Rickenbacker fingerboards look distinctive with that lacquer.', "We're about the only ones who do that, I guess. It brings out the colour. I think some musicians think it don't play as good. But it looks better. I guess you give up something and get something.", "So maple, walnut, and rosewood—it's never changed?", "You know, we used a little bit of ash before, in LA, and I think a time or two down here we tried ash. Birch a little bit, but not much of it—we made some 360s in LA from that. With birch, you have to fill more. I think it's about the same price, but it is hard to fill. We sometimes get old ones back to work on. The way to tell is the grain—you sand it down and you can almost see into that grain.", "The ash would have been for some of the solidbody guitars and stuff, the Combos. Wouldn't have been much, we just tried some. And ash is pretty heavy, too. We've used maple for some fingerboards, of course. We've used some ebony—I think the 4002 basses, and we put out some 360s, maybe 15 years ago. If a customer wants it, we'll put it on. But the walnut has always been walnut, which is a decorative item more than anything. Real soft and easy to work.", "Were you ever aware that at Rickenbacker you were making instruments that were different than everyone else's?", "No, not really. I didn't know if there were any guitars out like that or not at that time. I'd never seen any, and never seen none to this day, I think. I never looked at that many guitars. I'd seen a few at the shop here that Mr. Hall would bring in, this and that, but I very seldom went to a music store and looked at any.", 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

But for many of us, television was likely the first place we heard the synthesizers that we lust after now.", "Whether it be cop shows of the 1970s or action and science fiction in the 1980s, synthesizers were all over TV soundtracks. With that in mind, we're going to take a look at a collection of synths that grace eight great TV themes.", '', "Perhaps the peak of the synthesizer/TV-theme crossover era, Miami Vice married pastel suits, espadrilles, and action to Jan Hammer's blistering synth work. A member of fusion band Mahavishnu Orchestra, Hammer pioneered a solo synth style that mimicked the electric guitar. Starting in 1984 and running for five seasons, the show really helped make the sound of the synthesizer ubiquitous in pop culture. And, as each episode was uniquely scored, it kept Hammer busy for much of the 1980s.", 'Although the explosive main theme, with its Fairlight CMI percussion, got the lion\'s share of the attention at the time, it\'s the more plaintive "Crockett\'s Theme" that has become something of a standard. Although a number of synths can be heard, such as the Fairlight, it was the Roland Jupiter-8 that provided the backbone for the song in the form of an arpeggiated bass line.', 'Released in 1981, the Jupiter-8 was Roland\'s flagship polyphonic synthesizer for the first half of the 1980s. Its gorgeous sound graced countless pop hits and soundtracks as well. In "Crockett\'s Theme," it acts as an anchor, holding down the rhythm section so Hammer can solo over the top.', 'Speaking of solos… in 1974, a show debuted about a down-on-his-luck private eye. Although it was a slow starter, The Rockford Files, starring James Garner, soon grew into a monster. During its second season, its theme song was released as a single and stayed on the charts for 16 weeks, picking up a Grammy along the way for Best Instrumental Arrangement.', 'Written by a then-young Mike Post, who would go on to write many more memorable themes, and Pete Carpenter, the song was notable for its main melody, which was played on a Moog Minimoog Model D.', 'In the late \'70s, the sound of the synthesizer would become ubiquitous thanks to new wave and synth pop, but in 1975, when the theme was released as a single, it was still something of a novelty. Of course, it didn\'t hurt that the theme was catchy as hell, and really showcased the playability of the Minimoog. Just check out that glide between notes, reminiscent of the Ohio Players\' "Funky Worm." TV themes would go on to incorporate synthesizers more and more, but The Rockford Files was one of the first (and best).', 'The theme music for the long-running Doctor Who is often lauded as a pioneering piece of electronic music. Written by Ron Grainer and realized by Delia Derbyshire and Dick Mills in 1963 at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, the music was pieced together using musique concrète techniques. In 1980, for season 18, with Tom Baker as the doctor, Peter Howell recreated the theme using analog synthesizers, and it is this version that people of a certain age will remember most.', 'Although a number of synths were used, including the ARP Odyssey MKII, EMS Vocoder 5000, and Roland Jupiter-4, the galloping bassline was made with none other than the Yamaha CS-80.', "Made famous by Vangelis in his soundtracks for Chariots Of Fire and especially Blade Runner, Yamaha's massive poly was renowned for its playability and expressiveness, and, of course, its sound. Although usually thought of as a pad machine, it's just as good at bass and effects. In fact, the ring mod stinger that kicks off the 1980 theme was also made with the CS-80.", "David Lynch and Mark Frost's Twin Peaks originally ran for only two seasons, starting in 1990, but its influence on pop culture can't be overstated. That extends to music as well, and Angelo Badalamenti's work on the cult series is nothing short of sublime.", 'For "Twin Peaks Theme" (aka "Falling"), Badalamenti used a variety of synthesizers and keyboards, including a Yamaha DX-7, Roland D-550, and E-Mu Emulator II. But it was the strings sound that we\'re most concerned with today. Anyone who\'s heard the song can instantly recall those gorgeous, haunting strings. They were played on a Roland MKS-70, the rackmount version of the JX-10, which is most famous for the preset called (appropriately enough) Soundtrack.', 'The MKS-70 and JX-10 were the last of Roland\'s classic analog synths. Because they were released at a time when analog was going out of style, they were designed to sound a little cleaner, a little more "digital." While the oscillators were DCO (digitally controlled), they were definitely analog. And, as the MKS-70 and JX-10 were like having two JX-8Ps in one box, they were capable of rich, soaring sounds. Which, we\'re sure you\'ll agree, were used to great effect on the Twin Peaks soundtrack. For a deep exploration of the main theme and "Laura Palmer\'s Theme," check out our "The Synth Sounds of Twin Peaks" videos.', "Running from 1984 to 1987, Airwolf was part of the action series boom that dominated TV in the mid-'80s. With a high-tech military helicopter and starring Jan-Michael Vincent, the show rivaled the movies for Cold War action fun. Of course, the driving synthesizer theme certainly helped. Written by Sylvester Levay and played by Jim Cox, the theme features the Oberheim OB-8 prominently, driven by a Roland MSQ-700 sequencer, with a LinnDrum providing the backbeat and an E-Mu Emulator filling out the mix.", 'The Oberheim OB-8 was the last of the giant Oberheim poly series, which also included the OB-X and OB-Xa. Released in 1983, the OB-8 is generally considered to be the "softer" of the series, but one listen to the pulsing bass and hard-hitting, unmistakable Oberheim brass of the theme and you\'ll know that this is a relative term. The Oberheim legend lives on in the Tom Oberheim/Sequential update, the OB-6.', "In the late '80s, it was hard to avoid the Yamaha DX7. It was all over the radio, movie soundtracks, and TV themes. And, as the machine was infamous for being hard to program, its stock presets were used. And used. And used.", "One particular favorite of TV composers was EP1, the electric piano preset, and it features prominently on Mike Post's theme to the 1990 crime drama show, Law & Order.", 'Released in 1983, the DX7 was a breakthrough synthesizer, in that not just synth heads but keyboardists in general had to have it. It could do electronic sounds, but it also excelled at more traditional instrument sounds, like marimbas and pianos. It also had an eminently playable key bed, which helped attract musicians more comfortable with piano-style keys.', 'Although this theme is a great example of the DX7 in action, it\'s actually "chung chung," Law & Order\'s famous transition sound that gets most of the attention. However, as this wasn\'t made with synthesizers, it\'s unfortunately beyond the scope of this article.', "Running from 1989–1998, Seinfeld is often referred to as the best sitcom ever made. What you may not know is that each episode has a uniquely played theme, with each synth bassline performed to fit around Jerry's opening standup monologue. The theme was written by TV soundtrack veteran Jonathan Wolff and featured beatbox-style percussion and a distinctive sampled slap bass sound. Although some claim it came from a 360 Systems MIDI Bass unit, it was in fact a Korg M1.", "Released in 1988, Korg's M1 was a monster synthesizer hit. In fact, it's the best-selling synthesizer of all time. With its selection of sampled transients, sustained waveforms, and percussion, it offered a kind of realism of sound that hadn't been heard before. This is evident by the number of people who thought the bass in the theme was real and not a PCM sample.", "Although rarely heard now outside of ironic references to the time, the M1 slap bass wasn't the machine's only popular preset. The piano and organ presets were staples in dance music at the time and, to some extent, remain so to this day.", "It seems fitting that we end this piece on influential TV synths with Stranger Things, the revivalist 2016 sci-fi show that helped bring 1970s- and 1980s-style hardware synths back to the conversation. Referencing the movies of Steven Spielberg and John Landis, and the stories of Stephen King, Stranger Things is set in the 1980s—and so needed a period-perfect soundtrack. The show's creators, the Duffer Brothers, turned to Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein, two members of the Austin hardware band Survive, who created a theme that is both a tribute to the past and a beacon for those just getting into the world of hardware synthesizers.", "Although Dixon and Stein used a number of beautiful synths in the evocative theme song, such as the Sequential Circuits Prophet 5, Roland SH-2 and Korg Mono/Poly, we're going to call attention to the Oberheim Two Voice, which provides the main arpeggio line.", 'More mood than melody, the track is led by the fluctuating Two Voice, which provides the focus. Part of a series that included the larger Four Voice and Eight Voice units, the 1976 Two Voice was essentially two two-oscillator Oberheim SEM expanders packaged together with a keyboard and sequencer. As each SEM was a self-contained unit, each SEM\'s filter and envelope could be adjusted separately, leading to some creative and unique synthesis possibilities. (For more info, check out our "The Synths Sounds of Stranger Things" video.)', "Here's hoping that the recent resurgence in interest in hardware synthesizers will result in more synth-driven TV themes and soundtracks, which will in turn inspire another generation of future synth heads.", 'About the author: Adam Douglas is a musician and synthesizer fan based in Tokyo, Japan.

That, along with the robot dancing pants, left quite an impression on my young brain. It was one of the most futuristic performances I had ever seen and one of the things that got me interested in synthesizers at a young age.', "The keytar—the eye-catching, guitar-like synth at the center of his performance—is often maligned as maybe the most '80s of instruments, but by then, strap-on keyboards had been around, in one form or another, for quite some time. Perhaps the absolute earliest was the orphica—a little-known, four-octave, piano-like instrument first built in 1795.", "While that may be a historical anomaly, fast-forward to the electro-mechanical days of the mid-20th century and you'll find another entrant with the Weltmeister Basset, a battery-powered, hammers-and-reeds bass keyboard in the style of a Rhodes Piano Bass and Wurlitzer electric piano. But it wasn't until the dawn of synthesizers in the latter half of the 20th century that the keytar as we know it began to take shape.", "In 1966, Joh Mustad AB, a Swedish organ company, released the Tubon. As the name suggests, it's a strange, tube-shaped instrument with a small two-and-a-half octave keyboard that can be worn similarly to a guitar, but at its heart, it's a single-oscillator, monophonic analog synth with preset sounds and 32 mini keys. Like the Basset before it, the Tubon was primarily a bass instrument and was also battery powered.", 'A rather obscure device, the Tubon was never popular outside of its native Sweden. Notably, legend has it that Paul McCartney managed to get one and used it for some of the original sounds on "Strawberry Fields Forever." However, while there is photographic evidence of McCartney playing a Tubon at some point, The Beatles Recording Reference Manual Vol. 3 documents that McCartney played a Mellotron MKII from the song\'s earliest sessions, and the final track, of course, includes a Mellotron in place of any lines the Tubon may have once claimed.', "Another famous and confirmed user of the Tubon was Kraftwerk's Ralf Hütter, who can be seen using it live in 1970, in a video recorded in Germany.", 'By the 1970s analog synthesizers were becoming more prevalent in rock and pop music, with some keyboard players striving to match the showmanship of their guitar-wielding bandmates. A prime example is Edgar Winter donning the massive ARP 2600 keyboard controller around his neck to solo on "Frankenstein" in a 1973 performance on the The Old Grey Whistle Test. But he was far from alone in wanting to control an array of synths with a keyboard slung across his shoulders.', "To achieve such an end, Roger Powell, keyboardist for Todd Rundgren's Utopia created his own Powell Probe—the first polyphonic remote keyboard controller connected to a rack of synthesizer circuitry.", 'While these keyboards were controlling other, external synthesizers, in 1979, George Mattson came up with the idea of a self-contained synthesizer that had a left-hand controller section, which allowed for a large amount of continuous control over parameters. The synth was worn with a strap over the shoulder, making it the first commercially available keytar with a form factor that influenced (or was copied) by pretty much everyone else afterward. He called his creation the Syntar.', 'The first such synth had guts made up of modules from Electronic Music Laboratories (EML), which wound up working with Mattson on the electronics of his production-run units. Before that run though, Mattson took his prototype to the NAMM trade show in Atlanta to try to entice a company to partner with him and produce the design. At the convention, Moog was also displaying a prototype of its Liberation keytar, which, at that point, was still non-functioning.', "Mattson did manage to beat Moog to market, but, as an essentially one-man business, he wasn't able to produce Syntars in the same volume. He continued to make a handful of them into the early 2000s before creating the Mattson Mini Modular. The Syntar's voice architecture is a standard, 2 VCO monosynth, but what really sets it apart are the nine continuously variable CV neck controllers that can be mapped to several parameters, giving a tremendous amount of control.", 'Moog\'s Liberation monosynth, released in full in 1980, is similar to the Moog Rogue and Realistic MG-1 designs, with several buttons, a pitch ribbon, and three mod wheels on the left hand controller or the "neck" of the keytar. The power supply and CV/gate connectivity is located in a rack unit that attaches to the synth via a 40 foot multi-pin cable.', 'The Liberation was used by a huge variety of groups over the years, including new-wave group Devo, with each member sporting a Liberation in a Moog press photo.', '1980 also saw the release of the Davis Co. Clavitar controller, used famously by George Duke and Herbie Hancock, as can be seen in the aforementioned "Rockit" performance or a few of Duke\'s album covers. From this point on, the world saw a bit of a keytar explosion.', "Thanks to the popularity of keytar-friendly genres like new wave and synthpop, strap pegs were suddenly found on synths from nearly every major manufacturer: Casio's CZ-101, Korg's Poly 800, Yamaha's CS-01, Roland's SH-101, and more could now be played hanging from your neck, if you felt so inclined.", "While initial keytar synths tended to be analog synthesizers, as with the Syntar and Liberation, Yamaha's development of FM synthesis allowed for smaller circuits—and, thus, lighter designs.", 'Several Yamaha keytars utilized this technology, starting with the DX100—a standard small synth with strap peg—and continuing on with the SHS-10 and SHS-200, which have a shape more consistent the classic keytar form.', 'In 1994, Prince even designed and patented his own Purpleaxxe keytar, which he is said to have created for Tommy Barbarella, his keyboardist at the time.', 'The most prominent user today is probably Lady Gaga, who is well-known for using all sorts of heavily modified keytars in her theatrical live shows—everything from a seahorse design to a clear crystal pyramid—as well as more stock Roland AX-Synths.', "Today the keytar world is alive and well-stocked, with new ones in production by most major manufacturers, including Korg's updates to its RK-100S, the Roland AX line, Alesis' Vortex Keytar Controller, and Behringer's strap peg–equipped MS-101, its clone of the SH-101. Keyboardists will continue to be free to strut around stage while shredding solos well into the future.", 'Sam Mims—of the appropriately named Syntaur vintage synth repair shop and retailer—has been working on the next episode of his Synth Wizards video series, which is about keytars (or strap-on synths and controllers as he prefers to call them). He was kind enough to pass on some of his research for the episode to me, and I highly recommend his videos.

The sound of the drum track can be the single most-defining component of a given song. And different rhythmic textures—acoustic or electric, live or sequenced—have defined entire genres of music. The fact that so much educational and practical effort has been committed to crafting and capturing ideal drum sounds is hardly surprising.", "But for all this discussion of the ideal recording methods, it's often those drum sounds produced through experimental techniques, happy accidents, or spur-of-the-moment necessity that yield something truly special. Today, we're taking a look at six such instances.", "Nevermind and In Utero are both amazing and distinct-sounding records with drum tones that do much to define their character. On In Utero the band had engineer Steve Albini—who's known for his pummeling drum sounds—behind the board to dial things in, but it was on Nevermind with Butch Vig that one of the band's craftier studio moments occurred.", "Vig expanded the sound of Dave Grohl's bass drum by placing an elongating tunnel of other drum shells in front of his main kick drum, with an AKG D12 near the beater and a Neumann U 47 Fet at the tunnel's end. The added depth accentuated the sound of the drum going into the mic, extending the low-end while staying relatively isolated from the room sounds and the rest of the kit. It also didn't hurt to have Grohl kicking the Foo out of the batter head.", 'With all due deference to Giorgio Moroder and many underground progenitors, the Bee Gees\' contribution to the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack is likely the music that most people think of when they think disco. And if pulsing, four-on-the-floor drum beats are the most crucial component of the disco sound, then it\'s not too much of a stretch to say that the drum tracks on songs like "Stayin\' Alive" and "More Than a Woman" rank as some of the most central musical artifacts of the entire era, at least in the popular consciousness. It just so happens that these very drum tracks were created with a bit of last-minute studio ingenuity.', 'As the story goes—which is recounted in excellent detail in this Sound On Sound profile—the band was recording at Château d\'Hérouville in France. When drummer Dennis Byron had to skip back to England following the death of his father, the band tried to record to the fixed rhythm of a crude drum machine on a Hammond organ. Unsatisfied with the result, engineer Karl Richardson and producer Albhy Galuten had the clever idea of copying a two-bar segment of the live drums from the already tracked "Night Fever" over and over again to create a drum loop.', 'As Richardson later recounted in the Sound On Sound piece: "The tape was over 20 feet long and it was running all around the control room—I gaffered some empty tape-box hubs to the tops of mic stands and ran the tape between the four-track machine and an MCI 24-track deck, using the tape guides from a two-track deck for the tension. Because it was 4/4 time—just hi-hats and straight snare—it sounded steady as a rock, and this was pre-drum machine."', 'Richardson goes on to explain that between all the copying from the original four-track to a new half-inch tape loop, the final product was at least third-generation, with badly worn tape heads further degrading the audio. He EQ\'d the whole works to brighten everything up, and later, drummer Byron came back and overdubbed toms and additional cymbals. The band gave credit to Bernard Lupé as the drummer on "Stayin\' Alive" as an homage to Bernard Purdie.', "Through all of this studio splicing and re-recording, the sessions yielded one of the most danced-to tracks in history on the back of two bars of entirely locked-in live drums. Alongside the work of other disco pioneers, like Moroder's repetitious beats for Donna Summer, this prominent, looped drum track not only defined its era, but in it, you can hear the birth of many future dance genres to come.", "When most music snobs think of lo-fi music they probably think of records from indie rock mainstays like Guided By Voices or the first half of The Mountain Goats' catalog—those recordings that lean into amateur technique and imperfections like cassette tape hiss, background noises, and the birds chirping outside a bedroom studio window finding their way onto a take. What probably doesn't come to mind is the arena-filling, globe-spanning classic rock of The Rolling Stones.", 'In the \'60s though, during the band\'s ascent, several of their hits were built around Keith Richards\' late-night hotel recordings of an acoustic guitar going into an overloading cassette recorder, creating an irreplaceable blown-out quality that was then rerecorded through amplifiers in a proper studio. Keith has talked at length about using this technique on songs like "Jumpin\' Jack Flash" in various interviews and his autobiography, Life.', 'For the recording of "Street Fighting Man" from 1968, the lo-fi credentials go a step further to include Charlie Watts\' drum part. Also recorded into the same tape recorder as the guitars, Watts played the drum part on essentially a toy travel drum kit that packed up into a suitcase.', 'As Watts describes in the coffee table book, According to the Rolling Stones, the 1930s\' London Jazz Kit Set "came in a little suitcase, and there were wire brackets you put the drums in; they were like small tambourines with no jangles. The whole kit packs away, the drums go inside each other, the little drum goes inside the snare drum into a box with the cymbal. The snare drum was fantastic because it had a really thin skin with a snare right underneath, but only two strands of gut.\'\'', "If you listen to the track, however, the drums still sound huge. It's not entirely clear if this is a product of the same re-amping approach Keith used on his guitars, or if there is some tom and bass drum overdubbing going on as well.", 'It\'s been said that the drum fill on Phil Collins\' "In the Air Tonight" was the revolutionary moment that brought about the era of gated reverb drum recording. Today, gated reverb on drums and on snare drums in particular have become just another option in the studio, and plenty of DAWs and reverb plugins come stocked with presets on how to achieve this most \'80s of effect. In its origin, though, the discovery of gated reverb on drums was just another happy studio accident.', 'The accident in question actually occurred in an earlier recording in which Collins was guest drumming for Peter Gabriel for a song called "The Intruder." The whole discovery centered a shiny new SSL console that had a compressor and noise gate on every channel. The studio was also set up with a mic in the ceiling of the live room, which was itself heavily compressed. When you record drums in a loud, boomy room and compress it, you get some massive results, which caught the ear of Collins and producer Hugh Padgham.', 'From there, the team experimented a bit further. Padgham explains in this MusicRader interview: "When I pushed the button for the compressor on the console, there was a noise gate already in the chain and he stopped and the sound suddenly went to nothing..."', 'The result was a whip-like drum sound that goes from huge to silent almost immediately. Collins recruited Padgham to record his first solo album Face Value soon thereafter, opting to use their newly discovered drum technique in an even more cavernous live room to yield such singles as "In the Air Tonight," and before long, gated reverb settings were becoming standard in the first generation of digital reverb outboard units.', 'For a much more engaging take on this reverb tale that illustrates the full history and legacy of gated reverb, watch the video below from the always-inspiring Estelle Caswell of Vox.', 'While Paul Simon\'s discography is replete with fantastic drum tracks, as heard on "50 Ways To Leave Your Lover," "Obvious Child," and other songs, the dulcet tones of Simon & Garfunkel aren\'t exactly synonymous with big drum sounds. By the time of the recording of their final album, Bridge Over Troubled Water, however, the duo was at the forefront of studio techniques. They were, for instance, one of the first acts to use 16-track recording.', 'On one of the album\'s classic tracks, "The Boxer," during the campfire-friendly "lie la lie" refrain, there are unmissable drum hits played by the late Hal Blaine, who later described them as "... a cannon shot! Which was just the kind of sound we were after."', 'The approach taken by producer Roy Halee in the sessions for the song involved placing Blaine\'s kit in the hallway of the studio next to an elevator shaft to take advantage of the natural reverb of the space. According to Hal, "As I\'m crashing down, the door opens and there\'s an elderly rent-a-cop, I guess. ... And as I came down with this explosion that shook the building, it\'s like he died or he thought he was killed. The doors closed, we never saw him again."', 'There\'s another noteworthy bit of rhythmic creativity on Bridge Over Troubled Water found on "Cecilia." The distinct drum part on that song come from a party where the duo and some pals used a home tape recorder to capture them slapping their thighs and banging on things in the room. Simon and Halee identified a compelling snippet from the tape and created a loop with some added elements in the studio.', 'And what listicle about classic drum recordings would be complete without a reference to the legend of Led Zeppelin\'s "When the Levee Breaks."', 'The story has been told many times before and in longer and more thoughtful terms than presented here, but in short, the cavernous sounds that propel this blues-rock classic are the result of a prime recording location, some thoughtful mic placements, and the creative use of a Binson Echorec delay unit.', 'Recorded at Headley Grange, the process involved putting Bonzo and his kit in the lobby of the house, placing two Beyerdynamic M160s, treated with a hearty dose of compression, at the top of the first stairwell, and running the works through the Binson. The result is a massive, unmistakable drum sound where the applied echo expands the recorded track to an incredible size and depth.', 'As arguably the greatest rock drum track from the inarguably greatest rock drummer, the process at work is not without controversy. Some people assume it was just the sound of the room and reject the role of the Binson.

After all, this is the guy who had founded Kustom Amps and landed those distinctive tuck-and-roll cabinets on stages behind Creedence Clearwater Revival, Johnny Cash, The Jackson 5, Leon Russell, and countless others. And when he wasn't hob-knobbing with major stars of the '60s and early '70s, he was inventing a hand-held police speed radar device and pioneering affordable home satellite TV systems.", "Alongside all of this, that unassuming, gray, two-knob metal box was barely a footnote in musical history. That is, until Trey Anastasio put one on his pedalboard and guitarists of the late '90s and early '00s discovered that the Ross Compressor was one of the keys to the Phish guitarist's rich, succulent tone.", "The scramble to obtain surviving Ross Compressors, originally made from the early-mid '70s to around 1980 (when production was briefly moved to Taiwan), triggered the laws of supply and demand in a major way, and sent prices skyrocketing. A poll of recent sales on Reverb shows original units selling for as much as $500 USD, with average prices in the upper $300 to lower $400 range. Over the years, several boutique makers have issued their own homages to the circuit, but none carried the official family imprimatur.", 'Which is to say, this was one pedal ripe for a reissue.', "In 2018, Ross Audibles did just that. Founded by Bud Ross' grandson, Cameron Ross, and his childhood friend Ben Brazil, Ross Audibles meticulously reverse-engineered the gray Compressor—along with the much-loved, if less legendary, Ross Distortion—to bring them back to the market in as-close-to-original form as is humanly possible 45 years after their inception. Guitarists dubbed the results an unqualified success.", '"We sold out all of our pre-orders," Ben tells Reverb, "and then we did a run for a distributor in Japan and those all went. We\'re slowly getting into dealers now, and are going to try to push our Reverb.com sales as well."', "Put simply, the world's most iconic vintage compressor pedal is back, and will now be more widely available than ever before—but getting it there took some work, and a vision as big as that of Bud Ross himself. (You can order the new Ross Audibles Compressor and Distortion now.)", "Fans of the original gray Ross Compressor and its extremely cool sibling the Ross Distortion will be excited to have these pedals back in their original incarnations, rather than reinterpreted by an unrelated company. But these releases from Ross Audibles also represent a return to form for the work of one of the guitar industry's more significant names in the world of solid-state electronics et al. Yet, amazingly, according to Cameron, Bud Ross had no background in electronics, but was a natural inventor and entrepreneur, and had the kind of vision necessary to both develop a desirable product, and to make it fly.", 'Born in West Virginia, Bud had moved to Kansas at the age of 12 when his mother took a job in Overland Park, southwest of Kansas City. In his teens, he began both managing and playing bass in local bands, but, as Cameron says, "He didn\'t like the bass amps that were available at the time... so he built his own."', "It was playing at the Soc-Hop in Overland Park in 1960, according to the Kansas City Business Journal, that Bud encountered what would become the most distinguishing feature of his own future amp line. An attendee named Dave Gates was an experienced auto upholsterer, and asked if he could do a tuck-and-roll job on Ross' bass amp, giving it the padded Naugahyde look he'd been applying to the seats of many hot rods in the area.", 'Ross founded Kustom in 1964, and according to Cameron, he quit his day job and moved to Chanute, Kansas, because the small business association was giving people small loans to start new businesses there.', '"It could have been any town in southeast Kansas," says Cameron, "but they picked Chanute because of a Mexican restaurant that they liked. They rented a small grocery store, an old one, and started making the amps out of that and lived in the apartment above it."', '"Talking to my grandma, and talking to Bud," he adds, "they really pieced it all together in the early years. Giving Conway Twitty some amps to start things out, and giving free equipment to Johnny Cash. Then it really grew. I remember him telling me all the stories from his heyday: supplying amps for the Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Leon Russell, and all the stuff he did with The Jackson 5—watching the kids perform in their garage, crazy stories like that! One of my dad\'s best friends, who grew up with him, told me about coming over to the house to get my dad, and Neil Diamond was sitting there with Bud, just hanging out, swapping stories. He loved doing what he did!"', 'After growing Kustom Amplification into one of the more successful—and most recognized— manufacturers of solid-state guitar amps in America, Ross sold the company to Baldwin Pianos in 1972, and launched Ross Musical shortly after.', '"The first year or two they did some prototype-style pedals that you can still find floating around," Ben tells us. "They don\'t have the recessed knobs and they look a lot more like an MXR, with a script font as well. It must have been a couple years after that that they came out with the first real line, probably in \'74."', "If the initial Ross lineup of Compressor, Distortion, and Phase R1 looked a lot like the popular MXR pedals that had preceded them, that's because they had taken their inspiration largely from the latter's Dyna Comp, Distortion+, and Phase 45 units. As Ross developed the line, however, their own products grew more distinctive.", 'Regarding the Compressor in particular, Ben says, "It was about as good a technology as you could have. It\'s loosely based—or probably pretty closely based—on the MXR Dyna Comp, but with objective taste improvements on their end, for which Bud commissioned Jerry Schell. But I think it\'s just a very, very sturdy circuit. It does what it\'s supposed to do, and I think it\'s got a lot more character than most compressors you hear. It\'s a lot more colored and textured than a new, very stark compressor. It\'s musical, and I think that\'s what makes it really stand out, that it\'s not just a dynamic control, it\'s also an effect on its own, the way it colors the sound."', 'While vintage MXR Dyna Comps are desirable and collectible in their own right, the Ross Compressor outstrips these factors by a long shot, further proving that you need only change a few components within any relatively simple effect circuit to alter the results in a positive and desirable way.', 'Much as with the success that followed Bud Ross\' decision to use tuck-and-roll Naugahyde upholstery for his Kustom amps, a further stroke of design genius took his pedals away from the realm of "mere copies" for the release of the proper lineup in \'74 or \'75, and would forever set them apart from others in the field. This aspect of their manufacturing would also, however, prove one of the more challenging for Cameron and Ben to reproduce.', 'After initially building the pedals in generic, rectangular, MXR-style boxes, Ross commissioned a custom-manufactured enclosure in a wider shape, with more rounded corners and edges, an upward-sloping forward face, and an upper shelf with recesses for the knobs. The design proved both distinctive and functional, since it tilted the footswitch forward for easy stomping, while offering protection to the potentially fragile knobs above.', "All that being said, since it's not the kind of off-the-shelf box that many boutique pedal makers use, it took the new Ross Audibles operation some scrambling to bring it back to life.", '"When we got the older one and started this process, we had to find a manufacturer who could replicate the enclosure," says Cameron, "because it was a unique enclosure at the time, and I don\'t think there\'s anything quite like it out there right now. So we did a lot of work on that, to get it as close to the originals as possible."', 'Ben adds, "That was basically me sitting down with a ruler and a laptop and just hammering it out (laughs), and really developing a relationship with our foundry. That was our biggest expense going in, and our biggest barrier to entry, and I think it\'s really, really great that we can bring that enclosure back."', 'Similarly, every effort was made to precisely replicate the circuits, layouts, and components of both the Compressor and the Distortion. "I matched even the geometry of the traces to the original PCB (printed circuit board)," Ben tells us, "and it\'s to spec totally. It\'s a newer PCB, but is basically the exact same PCB as the vintage one. We used new old stock (NOS) ICs and NOS germanium diodes and tantalum caps, which I think really contributes to the sound."', 'Although it\'s less well-known than the Compressor, the Distortion has won plenty of fans over the years for its transparent, medium-gain overdrive sound. As Ben puts it, "It plays well with every amp. It\'s just a very pleasing distortion all the way across the board, wherever the knobs are set. It really is the sound of an op-amp driving germanium diodes, and I think you allow a lot more room for nuance when you make it so simple."', "Ultimately, Cameron tells Reverb, Ross Audibles intends to release the full original lineup from the Ross Musical factory in Chanute, Kansas. In addition to the traditionally sized Compressor, Distortion, and Phaser, this would eventually include the company's big-box and dual-effect pedals of the '70s, such as the Phaser Distortion, Stereo Delay, Flanger, and 10 Band Graphic Equalizer.", 'After that, we could even see some new members to the family. "The line is missing a fuzz pedal, in my opinion," Ben says, "and maybe a more classic overdrive based on an amplifier circuitry."', 'Whatever comes along, though, Ross Audibles intends to remain "true to the way Bud did it," Ben concludes, "taking everything we\'ve gathered from him and pushing that approach forward with some super high-quality products."', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

['After you finish this piece, be sure to check out our part two: 6 More British Amp Brands Worth Tracking Down.', 'While the sky-high prices fetched by some vintage guitars regularly hog the headlines, if you’re a tone hound, a vintage amp is every bit as desirable. The good news is that hardly any of them cost the eye-watering prices commanded by the best vintage guitars.', 'The bad news is that (1) they can be hard to fix when they go wrong and (2) you need to be careful what you buy. A faulty old guitar will just play like a plank and probably sound awful, but a faulty old amp can kill you.', 'If the amp comes with a frayed mains cable or a broken plug, if it makes strange noises—other than from your playing!—get it looked at by an amp specialist. Remember that inside, its components will be ancient, and they deteriorate with age. Also, it was made at a time when safety standards were far less strict, so never take risks with an old amp.', 'Thoroughly put off the whole idea? I hope not, because a well-maintained old tube amp can be a treasure house of tone—and all the better for its small size and relatively low output. A small vintage guitar combo will be ideal for recording and practice, offering supreme tone and bearable volume.', 'While we’re talking about tone, remember that ‘50s or early-’60s amps weren’t designed to distort—in fact just the opposite. Old amps were valued for their crystal clear, warm tone. Players didn’t learn how to make them scream until the mid-’60s, so you may need to drive your prized old combo pretty hard if you want it to sound like Jimmy Page’s Supro on Led Zeppelin. You may even need a mod or two—which is another reason you need to find a reliable, knowledgeable repairer.', 'Still got your heart set on a vintage amp? Here’s a small handful of British treasures that can really deliver. Some are old favorites, some you might never have heard of, and one even came under a different name when it was sold in the US. All of them are very desirable.', 'The Westminster may have been the first amp Charlie Watkins made, but the Dominator was the one that became an icon. In the early ‘60s, its output seemed enormous. It was rated at 17 watts but probably only produced 15. What set it apart, however, wasn’t just its loudness, it was the fact that with four inputs you could put two guitars, a bass, and a vocal mic in, and it would still work (just about).', 'Also, the Dominator had a V-fronted cabinet that oozed era. The V-front was Charlie’s idea to make an amp that was audible to an audience and didn’t deliver its sound mostly to the backs of a guitarist’s knees. It’s a moot point, but it remains a revered amp with a classic rock ’n’ roll sound.', 'It’s scarce these days, and while you might find an original example, it could need work. Maybe you’d rather have a new one for that authentic Johnny Kidd & The Pirates sound? It’s not impossible. In 2015, Charlie licensed John Beer, a British amplifier designer and repair guru, to build exact replicas. That means exact right down to manufacturing original components when necessary.', 'Before the advent of Marshall, the UK’s guitar amp market was dominated by two companies, Vox and Selmer. Selmer got there first, taking over an even older amp maker in the late ‘40s. By the ‘60s, they were perfectly poised for the rock ’n’ roll explosion and then the beat boom that followed on the heels of The Beatles in ’63.', 'Selmer ceased amplifier production in the early ‘80s, but its factory in Braintree, Essex (with others also made in London) produced a succession of reliable amps that became the working band’s workhorses of the era.', 'Selmer combos, like the Zodiac and the Thunderbird, were the alternatives to a Vox AC30 or 50, and they are still much-sought-after and priced accordingly. No less sought after is Selmer’s Treble-N-Bass 50 amp head (later produced in 100-watt versions).', 'As its name suggests, it was often used by bass players along with the fridge-sized 1x18 Goliath speaker cabs. Like Leo Fender’s Bassman, however, the Treble-N-Bass has had another life in the hands of guitarists.', 'One problem with Selmer amps is that the maker had a regular cosmetic upgrade program, which meant almost every year saw a new look: sometimes with new features; sometimes with just a new covering.', 'On that point, early-’60s examples covered in fake crocodile skin (really!) are very popular with collectors, but the amps within are a bit ancient now and likely to need some TLC.', 'The later (after mid-‘60s) black and blue or plain black examples are much the same product in admittedly less rock ’n’ roll packaging, and sometimes they are cheaper as a consequence.', 'Much as Selmer was the number two to Vox in the ‘60s, Carlsbro never managed to achieve the glory accorded its UK rival, Marshall, in the ‘70s. This wasn’t due to any lack of quality on Carlsbro’s part.', 'In fact, its amps were the mainstay of the semi-pro scene for over two decades. But just as an earlier generation had tended to switch from Selmer to Vox once they hit the big time, so Carlsbro users tended to gravitate to Marshall.', 'Carlsbro did have one or two name artists, however, and one of the most prominent was the cult guitarist Bill Nelson, who made tremendous use of the TC 100 all-tube head.', 'TC 100s and their 50-watt siblings, the TC 60s, have all the basics right: Partridge transformers, EL34 output tubes, and a high standard of build quality. They don’t sound exactly the same as a Marshall equivalent, despite sharing so many components in common, but they do sound great. And who wants to sound like everyone else, anyway?', 'Also, Carlsbro amps tend to sell for a lot less money than their Marshall equivalents, which makes them tempting and quite practical to own and use. Look out for other vintage Carlsbro tube amps, too, but don’t confuse them with today’s Chinese-made models. These are quite acceptable modern production amps but are not recreations of the old handmade tube heads and combos.', 'By now, it seems everyone knows that Park was Jim Marshall’s way of selling amps that didn’t go through his distributor. Essentially, Parks were Marshalls with a different badge. There was a time when Park amps were cheap, but that has long since passed.', 'However, Marshall produced a lot of Parks and they are, presumably, still out there, which means you have a reasonable chance of finding one being sold by someone who doesn’t realize it’s a Marshall in disguise.', 'Of them, the LE 20 combo is a favorite among the Park cognoscenti, and while it’s difficult to be precise about dates, production seems to have taken place from the ‘70s to the very early ‘80s.', 'It uses the tried-and-trusted 12AX7 preamp and EL84 power amp tubes, feeding 20 watts into a British-made 12-inch Celestion speaker housed in a very open-backed enclosure.', 'Driven with decent pickups and/or a pedal or two, this is a loud amp, despite its rating, and it’s capable of a stinging lead sound at considerable volume.', 'Like the Treble ’n Bass head, the Zodiac combo was endlessly tweaked to make it seem that a new model appeared almost every year, but reality moved a little slower.', 'Although the Zodiac might have competed with Vox’s AC30, Zodiac Twin 30s and Twin 50s sound quite different from their Vox counterparts. Think Hilton Valentine’s guitar sound on The Animals’ "House Of The Rising Sun," which was almost certainly recorded using one of these amps.', 'The EL34 output tubes of the Zodiacs provided a very British sound, but the amps had useful extras for added sparkle (or gimmicks, if you’re feeling cynical). These included push-button tone selectors and a “magic eye” lamp on top that showed your tremolo speed.', 'Zodiac 30s were fitted with 12-inch Alnico Celestions, the 50s with ceramic-magnet Goodmans speakers. They may have seemed like poor alternatives to Vox’s AC30 at the time, but recent years have seen Zodiacs rediscovered and used by a new generation who value what are surprisingly powerful and rich-sounding all-tube combos.', '[Ed.: The Selmer Zodiac is so prized, it found its way into our first "7 Amps in Need of a Reissue" article.]', 'Time hasn’t been kind to the Proamp brand, mostly because the name was later adopted by at least one other (unrelated) company, which has led to some confusion.', 'The original Proamps were designed by John Cooper (no relation to this writer), a former Selmer amp engineer and a partner in the original Proamp company based in Essex, south-east England, in the early ‘80s.', 'Proamp’s Viper models, made in 60- and 100-watt versions, were completely unlike the flood of Marshall-ish tube amps of the ‘70s and ‘80s, and were more akin to Music Mans, utilizing solid state preamps and tube power amps (616-driven).', 'It’s a combination that tends toward loud and sparkling clean, rather than warm and dirty. That said, a Proamp Viper at full power is a force to be reckoned with.', 'In the company’s short history, it produced a number of different versions, including some all-tube amps, of which the best was probably the V65. All Proamp combos came with Celestion speakers in various configurations—and there were heads, too, but they’re less common.', 'An unusual twist is that Proamps were rebranded KMD for sale in the US, and for a brief period these achieved some success before the manufacturer ran into difficulties and closed.', 'There is good news for owners of Proamp/KMD amps who have had problems getting spares and service in the past. John Cooper purchased the stock of spares and unassembled components from the collapsed company and is available to service and repair most Proamps and KMDs.', 'Owners of old Proamps or KMDs can contact him at valvetech44@aol.com.', 'About the author: Gary Cooper is a journalist working in the musical instrument and pro audio fields.

Alvino Rey is the man to blame. Story goes, the guitarist and electronics buff helped Gibson develop its E-150 steel of 1935 and suggested a tone control, probably the first time such a thing had appeared on an electric guitar. Since then, makers have added more controls—and, in some cases, many more. Here we look at six cases through the years that track the ebb and flow of knobs, switches, dials, and levers.', "During the '40s, Gibson had developed its long-held closeness with dance-band and jazz guitarists, listening carefully to what they wanted. Maybe the conversation broke down, however, when it came to the controls offered on a new instrument that the company launched in 1949. The ES-5 was one of the earliest three-pickup guitars. Certainly this was new territory to explore, but it became clear something wasn't quite right.", 'Players struggled to get the most from its layout of three volume knobs and one master tone. There was no selector, and so balancing the pickups was solely down to wrestling with each volume control. Gibson had jumped dramatically from one-pickup guitars to this three-pickup instrument.', 'When it introduced the two-pickup Super 400CES and L-5CES in 1951, the classic Gibson layout of a volume and tone per pickup and a three-way selector was born. Four years later, the ES-5 was reconfigured and given a new name that hinted at a new control scheme: the ES-5 Switchmaster.', "Mirroring the company's new layout for two-pickup guitars, the revised ES-5 now had a volume and tone control for each pickup, making for six knobs in all, and where the master tone knob had been on the ES-5's cutaway, the Switchmaster had a new four-way selector switch that offered each pickup in turn or all three together. This made for a much more logical control layout, and the model lasted in the line until the early '60s.", "If you've been lucky enough to play an original early Telecaster, you might have found the controls rather odd. The classic layout of two metal knobs and a three-way selector was there from the start, and the front knob has always controlled master volume. Beyond that, however, early Teles did things rather differently.", 'At first, they were wired so that the selector in the rear position delivered both pickups, and the rear knob controlled the amount of neck-pickup sound blended into the bridge-pickup sound. With the selector in the other two positions, the guitar delivered neck-pickup only with preset tone—in the middle position with a "natural" tone, and in the front position with a bassier tone—while the rear knob had no function in either setting.', 'In 1952, Fender changed that system. With the selector in the rear position, you got the bridge pickup alone, and the rear knob acted as a proper tone control. In the middle position, there was neck pickup alone, also with proper tone control. In the front position, the effect was the same as the old system—neck-pickup alone, with a preset bassier tone and a non-functioning rear knob.', 'It meant that from \'52 until the late \'60s, there was no both-pickups setting on a Telecaster, although some players soon discovered "secret" settings between the selector switch\'s official stops.', "Nathan Daniel began his career in the '30s making amplifiers, including some for Epiphone's Electar brand. He started Danelectro in New Jersey in 1946, at first to supply amps to mail-order outlets, but in 1954 he began making Danelectro guitars with cloth- or vinyl-covered bodies. A few years later he introduced the U series, which included the first electric guitars with stacked control knobs.", 'Daniel cared little for convention in the way he manufactured guitars, so it was no surprise that he should take a different approach when it came to the way his controls worked. He made the bodies of the U-1 and U-2 in line with his fondness for cheap materials and simple production, using a pine frame with a top and back sheet of Masonite (a brand of fiberboard), edged in vinyl. He gave the U models clear plastic pickguards, distinctive headstocks, and pickup cases made from lipstick tubes.', 'On the two-pickup U-2, his novel "television-style" stacked controls offered a combined volume and tone per pickup. Daniel\'s contemporary catalogue was a model of promotional hype, saying the company had "eliminated the confusion of four separate control knobs" and instead offered "a concentric double knob for each pickup [that] greatly increases ease and speed of control during play."', 'The U-2 had a regular pickup selector, but why did the U-1 need one? Daniels had neatly simplified production and proudly explained that the U-1\'s switch gave "three instant tone changes," a facility available on "no other single-pickup guitar."', 'Rickenbacker introduced its model 460 in 1961, the first with a modified control layout that the company would apply to nearly all its models over the coming years. A smaller blend control was added just behind the four regular knobs.', "With the three-way selector in neck-pickup-only or bridge-pickup-only positions, the fifth knob provided the opportunity to blend in some tone from the unselected pickup. So, with just the bassier neck pickup selected, the fifth knob could blend in a little of the bridge pickup's more trebly tone. And vice versa. With the selector in the mid position, giving both pickups, the fifth knob varied the precise balance between the two, for increased tonal emphasis.", 'On Rickenbackers fitted with the company\'s Rick-O-Sound stereo feature, the fifth knob functions more as a balance control between left and right—neck pickup and bridge pickup—because to achieve stereo, the selector was lodged in the centre position so that both pickups were "on." However, some guitarists still find Rick\'s blend control baffling and decide to forget their guitar has a fifth knob.', "When I was working on The Ultimate Guitar Book back in the mists of time, one of my favorites from the wilder side of guitar history was a magnificent example from Paul Day's collection, the Godwin Super Professional Guitar-Organ. I think I might be in safe territory to say that this is the guitar with the most controls ever crammed onto one pickguard.", 'It was produced around 1976 in Italy by Sisme, who were used to making Godwin-brand organs. Like Vox before them, they decided—during what I suspect must have been a rather boozy evening after work—to shove most of an organ inside the guitar and hook up the frets to its tone generators. Yes, the result was very heavy. Yes, it was big. And yes, it had 32 controls. Sadly, very few people voted with their wallets to have what amounts to an Italian church organ slung around their necks.', "Active electronics, the system powered by an onboard preamp, made a big impact in the '70s following its popularization by Alembic. The idea was to put a battery-powered preamp into a guitar, boosting its signal and widening its tonal range, and in the process offering more of a techy sheen among the newly popular keyboard synthesizers that were invading rock stages and studios.", "Bernardo Rico at B.C. Rich leapt on the idea, notably with the Bich of the late '70s. Once you'd got past the dangerous looking body, the shrieking DiMarzios, and the two preamps inside, there was a spectacular array of six knobs and six switches to deal with. OK, that knob near the bridge pickup ought to be a master volume. That's the easy one. Now what?", "The other four regular-looking knobs controlled master tone, neck-pickup volume, and one each for the volume of the two preamps. A chicken-head knob was Rich's take on Gibson's six-position Varitone, as on the ES-345 of 1959. There was a group of four switches: a regular pickup selector, plus three smaller ones that turned the preamps on and off and put the pickups in or out of phase. A further two switches put the pickups into parallel or series.", "For some, this was a fiddler's paradise to help achieve the perfect sound that had always seemed just a missing flickswitch away. For others, well… where's that Kramer Baretta of mine?", 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music. He is a co-founder of Backbeat UK and Jawbone Press.

But while you might think the major-brand and boutique makers alike have already dredged up all they can from the glory days of tube amplification, there are still loads more hip and tasty models of yesteryear that are ripe for reissue.", "Back in October, we called out underappreciated models from Gibson, Vox, Fender, Selmer, WEM, Mesa/Boogie, and Traynor. Now it's time to dig up seven more amps in need of a reissue—a few of which are also from these makers, and several from further down the vintage playlist.", "Others have danced around this format—tweed Deluxe reissues and Champ-type combos hitting the high and low sides, for example—but the tweed Vibrolux of the late '50s is one of the sweetest-sounding, most easily and tonefully recorded amps of that era… yet it's missing from today's market in any sort of genuine Fender-branded reissue.", "Bigger than the Champ and Princeton of the era, yet smaller than the Deluxe, the Model 5F11 tweed Vibrolux is just right for cranking up in the studio. It's great for achieving fully fledged tweed tones in a small club setting, yet it also yields delectable clean tones when reined in.", 'Expect about 10 watts of output from a dual-6V6 back end, through a dynamic 10" Jensen P10R Alnico speaker. The front end carried two 12AX7 preamp tubes (rather than using a lower-gain 12AY7 in the first position like most tweed Fenders), and the tremolo effect was the lush, rich, bias-modulated variety like many other amps of the era.', 'Added to all of that is the fact that this is one irresistibly cute-looking little combo, and light as a feather (or, well, 20-odd pounds of feathers anyway). The cab is the usual high-quality, finger-joined, solid-pine affair, with the "floating" speaker baffle that contributes so much resonance and character to the amp\'s overall sound.', 'Many players have already figured out that the dual-6V6 Harvard model of the era is largely the same thing without the tremolo. Also, the brownface 1x10" Princeton of the early \'60s is a broadly similar amp too, if different in a few essential ways—though it isn\'t that much cheaper on the vintage market these days.', "If you're not a major peruser of vintage-guitar-tone exposés or a hardcore Beatlemaniac, chances are you've never heard of this little British combo from the late '50s and early '60s. Regardless, the AC-55 contributed mightily to the launching of not one but two major rock 'n' roll legends, and is well worthy of a reissue today—if, perhaps, a slightly tweaked one.", 'Manufactured by Lee Products Ltd. alongside a range of radios and gramophones, Elpico guitar amps were sold largely in British appliance stores. They were somewhat the UK\'s equivalent of the "catalog guitar amps" that populated Sears and Wards sales literature in \'50s and \'60s America.', 'The first amplifier ever purchased by Paul McCartney was an Elpico AC-55, which he and other members used on several early recordings and performances by the pre-Beatles incarnation The Quarrymen. A few years later, Dave Davies of The Kinks snapped up an AC-55 that he saw in the front window of an electronics store down the road from the London studio where they were attempting to record "You Really Got Me," and famously slashed the speaker with a razorblade to help achieve what is considered one of the most formative distorted guitar sounds in early rock.', "This cute little trapezoidal green combo carries two EL84 output tubes, although its wattage is well shy of the 15–20 watts you'd get from a similarly equipped Vox AC15, thanks to the low voltages used on those tubes, and the small output transformer. And that's probably a good thing: The undersized, elliptical Celestion speaker probably wouldn't handle much more than the 10 watts or so that the AC-55 likely delivers. Otherwise, the amp had inputs for both Mic and Gram (gramophone), and independent Treble and Bass controls. Maybe a reissue with a bigger OT and a slightly sturdier, more traditional speaker? Crank it up!", "Gibson has a lot of weird and wonderful guitar amps that never quite achieved the status of their guitars from the same era (or the amps of competitor Fender, for that matter), and the GA-79RVT, made from 1961 to '67, is one of the more interesting. There was a time in the late '50s and early '60s when much of the guitar industry, like the audio industry in general, assumed that stereo was the way forward for all things sound-producing, and the GA-79RVT is the result.", 'Designed to partner up with Gibson\'s so-called stereo guitars of the era such as the ES-355, the GA-79RVT carried two independent output stages, each powered by a pair of EL84 (aka 6BQ5) tubes for 15 watts per side through individual Jensen C10Q speakers. Alternatively, flip the switch to link the channels and blast it out as a 30-watt 2x10" combo. The front end of each channel came courtesy of unusual 6EU7 preamp tubes (similar to a 12AX7 in performance, but with different pin connections—so don\'t try to substitute them), and each had its own independent Treble and Bass controls.', "Of course, anyone can tell at first glance that the GA-79RVT is far more exotic than even these specs imply: Dig that wedge-shaped cabinet. The goal here was to achieve a wide stereo soundstage, although the near-90-degree dispersion angle can leave a bit of a hole in the middle when you're standing right in front of the amp... but it sure fills the room from farther back.", 'The "RVT" in the name denotes the tasty reverb and tremolo on Ch1, both tube-driven, and capable of some lush atmospherics when used together.', 'Marshall has reissued several close cousins of this model, but I\'d like to think that a period-correct re-creation of the late-\'70s Master Model 2204 could be the missing link between them—and arguably one of the more desirable of the post-Plexi-style reissues. Less recognized than its predecessors of the \'60s, the 50-watt 2204 and its 100-watt sibling, the 2203, are nevertheless the sound of late-\'70s and early \'80s rock. Say the word "Marshall" and most people think "Plexi"—but hear the word "Marshall" and chances are your mind\'s ear is hearing a 2204 instead.', "Many players think of the 2204 and 2203 as models within the JCM800 range, but they actually came about several years before that series was brought to market. In the wake of Mesa/Boogie's popularization of cascading-gain preamps and master-volume controls other big amp makers adapted these design trends through the course of the '70s, and Marshall followed suit in 1975 with the release of its Master Model range.", "Initially the 50-watt 2204 had just the master volume and no major preamp tweaks, while its big brother the 2203 added cascading gain (in which the signal flows from one preamp tube into another to exponentially increase the gain). Part way through '77, however, the 2204 gained the same cascading-gain front end, so amps manufactured after this point tend to be more desirable, and more thoroughly representative of the breed.", "These heads are not channel-switchers (via footswitch, at least), but you can plug into the Low Sensitivity input to tap just one initial gain stage for a clean sound (though one that's a little thinner than the traditional vintage Plexi sound), or the High input to run through the cascaded preamp stages.", 'Otherwise, these heads are classic Marshall through and through, with the cathode-follower Treble, Middle, Bass tone stack, and dual EL34 output tubes in the amps made for the UK and European markets, or dual 6550s in the US market. (The 6550s were adopted because they were more easily attained in North America, and therefore limited warranty issues—but the change to EL34s is a simple mod, and most players using 6550s find them entirely Marshall-esque regardless).', "This one might at first seem a head scratcher because original examples are priced low enough that you'd likely have to charge more for a reissue built to the same standards (modest as those standards may be), but this is such a cool, convenient, and appealing design—both sonically and stylistically—that it warrants a reboot.", 'The Silvertone 1482 was one of many products, alongside other amplifiers and Silvertone guitars, that were made for Sears Roebuck by the Danelectro company. Find one of these originals from the early \'60s advertised for sale today and the listing will invariably refer to it as "a poor man\'s Fender tweed Deluxe", and that does capture some of the Silvertone 1482 combo\'s appeal, but it is simultaneously something less, and so much more.', 'In addition to the basic two-channel, 1x12" combo format using two 12AX7 preamp tubes, two 6V6GT output tubes, and a tube rectifier, the Silvertone adds a decent-sounding bias-modulated tremolo driven by one 6AU6 tube, while subtracting some of the output power to deliver a more modest 10 or 12 watts (original catalogs advertised "15 watts of power," but this is likely somewhat optimistic). The result is an amp that\'s more easily overdriven without rattling the walls, and one that achieves an appealingly gnarly, B-list-grade distortion when it gets there, too, plus a soft and compressed attack thanks to its inefficient 6X4 rectifier tube.', "Added to all of that, it's just one nifty- and original-looking little combo, with its side-mounted controls and chassis (kudos to Tone King for capture some of that swagger in its Falcon model), and a super-light carry as well. One thing any reissue might want to address is the speaker baffle: Replacing the original thin, cheap particle board with proper plywood would only be a good thing.", "The first installment of this series tipped a hat to the rockin' WEM Dominator MkIII of the '70s, but in Part 2 we dive deeper down the well to retrieve an earlier offering in Charlie Watkins's amplifier lineup, from a time before he decided to change the brand name to WEM to ape VOX's increasing success.", "In part, the Westminster deserves resurrection just because examples from this era are so darn tasty-looking, in a red-and-white two-tone Rexine covering in '55–'56, and green-and-white in '57–'58. That aside, they are crankable little Brit-rock monsters any day of the week.", 'Powered by a pair of EL84 output tubes pushed by ECC83 (aka 12AX7) preamp tubes, these attain the archetypically sweet, lush clean shimmer and juicy, harmonically saturated overdrive that other smaller British beauties like the Vox AC15 and Marshall 18-watter are known for, but with their own distinct, slightly ratty edge and the inefficient characteristics of the single Goodman\'s 10" speaker.', 'Perhaps give the reissue a sturdier 10" speaker or even big it up a little with a good 12", and firm up that thin, bent-steel chassis, and we\'re in business.', 'Traynor did reissue the Guitar Mate YGM-3 a few years back, but there\'s something quirkily marvelous about its sibling the YGM-4. Inside the chassis the amp is very similar, but run it through a 4x8" speaker complement in a closed-back combo cabinet, and something very different happens.', "Think Fender Super Reverb meets mini-Marshall and you're close, but the Traynor has plenty of its own thing going on too.", "Circuit-wise, the Studio Mate doesn't necessarily copy from anyone, but it does offer elements familiar from both of the major makers name-checked above.", "The ECC83/12AX7-derived preamp does take a few nods from Fender's blackface designs with the EQ stage and its two tone controls sandwiched between the two gain stages provided by the first preamp tube, but the volume potentiometer is placed before the tone pots for a slightly different response, and several of the component values are different too.", 'Which is only to say, this is no Fender copy, by any means, and has very much its own thing going on.', 'Driving it all into two EL84 output tubes via a robust long-tailed-pair phase inverter lends the tone a sweet blend of crispy articulation and meaty overdrive, and the onboard tube-driven reverb and tremolo are both pretty luscious too.', 'The four 8" speakers contribute a fast, detailed response to the amp\'s overall sound, although any reissue might benefit from slightly upgraded drivers to improve the performance at higher volumes, and reduce the tendency to fart out in the lows when pushing the amp\'s full 20 watts.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

In fact, Japanese guitar making had reached a peak during that decade, having perfected the mass production of quality instruments at a time when specialist tonewoods were still freely available—and just before production costs rose. This sent manufacturers and brand owners (not always the same things) first to South Korea and then to China, where the learning curve had to begin all over again.', 'The Japanese acoustic guitar scene of the ‘70s isn’t an easy one to follow. "Who made what and for whom?" is an endless pursuit—and it does matter, because a brand could suddenly produce an unexpectedly superior instrument, having bought a particular model or series from one of the better suppliers.', 'Where do you begin looking, when most of the published information is firmly focused on the major American acoustic makers? Well, there is information online, sometimes scrappy and sometimes contradictory, but that is something you have to get used to when researching Japanese guitars.', 'Even some of the distributors of the big brands were never quite sure who was making which of their models, nor quite sure what they were going to get in the next shipment. Compounding that, 40 years later, memories can be unreliable, and what records there were may have been lost. The good news is that a small number of dedicated fans have worked hard to retrieve useful information, so Google is your friend.', 'The prowess of some brands in this area is a given. More or less any Takamine is going to be good, and any Yamaha is going to be at least pretty playable and, at its best, world-class. Either brand really deserves its own article, as does Alvarez Yairi.', 'What we are looking for here, however, are the standout guitars from the less obvious sources that are worth tracking down—and that will repay the dedicated hunter with an individualistic instrument of surprising quality, and an instrument by now nicely played-in, aged, and, with a bit of luck, at a good price.', "This doesn’t pretend to be anything like an exhaustive list—there are many but-what-abouts that could be added—but it's intended more as a starting point of what could become a fascinating journey of exploration.", 'Aria is better known for its solidbody electric guitars and some fine basses, and the brand name, if it is associated with acoustic instruments at all, tends to be pegged to beginner-level, nylon-strung, Spanish-style guitars, and some pretty forgettable dreadnoughts and folk models. The two exceptions—actually four, as they came in six-string and 12-string versions—appeared in the late ‘70s as the John Joyce JJ and the Paul Brett PB models.', 'Joyce and Brett were noted blues guitarists connected with Aria’s UK distributor, Gigsville, where Joyce was the in-house repairman. Gigsville wanted to offer high-quality Aria acoustics and introduced the two guitarists to Aria, which commissioned them to design six-string and 12-string signature models. The results were impressive.', 'Featuring entirely solid woods, the Joyce and Brett models were like no other Aria acoustics before, leading to speculation that they had been made by one of the premier Japanese acoustic producers. In fact, recent contact with a former Aria employee in Japan confirms that they were produced by Matsumoku, the factory long associated with Aria instruments (and later with Westone and others).', 'Matsumoku was known to be capable of producing some fine instruments but is really best known for its solidbody guitars and basses. The fact that these acoustics came from the same plant makes me wonder what else they produced, as they were known to provide instruments for other brands, including Washburn and Epiphone.', 'The Joyce and Brett models were extremely well-made, great-sounding, and yet quite affordable. They were intended to be sold only in the UK, but in fact they seem to have appeared in other countries, too. John Joyce died in 2004, but not before designing another Aria acoustic classic, the Sandpiper series, examples of which are also worth looking out for. Paul Brett is still very much with us, both as an authority on vintage guitars and a designer for the Vintage brand.', 'By 1970, US guitar makers were starting to suffer from the inroads made into their home and international markets by Japanese guitars, which were no longer instruments to be laughed at (which, in any case, wasn’t always justified). Japan’s classical guitar makers had a distinguished history, but the first attempts to mass-produce electric and steel-string acoustic guitars for a mass market weren’t always very successful.', 'It is Yamaha we have to thank for changing that. In the ‘60s, it produced the hugely successful FG models in its factory in Hamamatsu and went on to make professional quality acoustic guitars played at various times by Bert Jansch, John Denver, Paul Simon, Jimmy Page, and others.', 'In the US, C.F. Martin’s response to the low-cost competition was a pragmatic "if you can’t beat them…" approach. In 1970, it introduced the Martin Sigma range, which rapidly established a mystique around itself worthy of its association with the Martin legend.', 'Vintage Sigmas from the early ‘70s are fairly hard to find, and some owners swear they compete on equal terms with Nazareth-produced originals. There are lengthy debates about serial numbers and plenty of fables about the materials used. Some claim the reason they sound so good is because they were made of all solid woods, which is not the case. In fact, most Sigmas had laminated backs and sides, and some even had laminated tops, too. Given how good a "First Generation" all-laminate Sigma Dreadnought can sound, this should give pause for thought among those who insist that only solid-wood acoustics can sound "right."', 'Martin used various Japanese manufacturers to supply Sigma models, which were checked and set up in the US before sale. Manufacturers included Tokai and Kasuga, and while Tokai might be best-known for its much-loved solidbody Fender and Gibson clones, Tokai’s own Cat’s Eyes acoustics, which were effectively Martin copies, again with laminated backs and sides, are much sought after and often well priced. Look out for the Tokai CE-400 (D-28 copy) and CE-800 (D-35 copy) as good examples.', 'Potential Sigma buyers need to do their research, because not all Sigmas were made in Japan (Martin had models made in Korea relatively early), and serial numbers and label styles are quite complex. Fortunately, the detailed information you need is available online. "Second Generation" dreadnoughts with solid tops are particularly prized and worth looking out for.', 'Trying to condense the complicated history of the Yairi family’s guitar making is beyond the scope of a short article, but suffice to say that both K. Yairi and S. Yairi, though related, ran separate companies.', 'It was Kazuo Yairi (K. Yairi) who studied guitar-making in the US after learning his trade in Japan and then formed a partnership with the US distributor St Louis Music, which resulted in the famous Alvarez Yairi guitars—the brand name they were sold under in the US—while in Europe they were sold separately as K. Yairi and Alvarez.', 'Alvarez Yairi, like Yamaha, really deserves a dedicated article, but as K. Yairi’s own guitars were less well-marketed and are highly prized, they are also worth tracking down.', 'One in particular was a license-built model for Bozo Podunavac, the US-based guitar maker born in what at the time was Yugoslavia and whose ornately decorated guitars were and still are highly prized by collectors and serious acoustic players. Leo Kottke was a prominent Bozo user in the ‘60s and ‘70s, which boosted the maker’s profile.', 'One of Bozo’s most popular designs was the Bell Western, and a small number of these were hand-built by K. Yairi in Japan, complete with the ornate design work.', 'Later—and admittedly outside the general scope of this article—Yairi also license-built some guitars for George Lowden, and these, too, are much admired. Ah, but which Yairi? Some sources say it was Kazuo, others that the Lowdens were made by his uncle Sadao in a separate factory. This is just one example of the complexity underlying Japanese guitar collecting, though by no means the most confusing.', 'Any K. Yairi guitar is likely to be expensive, but they are reckoned by their owners to be worth the money. Not exactly the choice for the bargain hunter (unless you are very lucky), but as good of its kind as it gets.', 'Yamaki is not a name you see often, but now and then a Yamaki acoustic from the ‘70s will turn up, and when it does it is often a force to be reckoned with. Apparently, the Yamaki company is still in business today but concentrates on making guitar parts.', 'What we are looking for, however, are acoustic guitars sold with the Yamaki brand name or, sometimes, with Daion. Yamaki may have been responsible for some of the fine Washburns of the era, too, notably the Prairie Song models, which are collectable and highly regarded.', 'While on the subject of Washburn, and again as an illustration of how complicated it can be to get to the bottom of who made what, someone who worked at a UK guitar distributor recalls how occasionally he would unpack a new shipment of Aria acoustics, only to find that the guitars inside had the Washburn brand.', 'Yamaki guitars were primarily in the Martin, Gibson, or Guild style, but the brand was dropped in the early ‘80s in favor of Daion. So any Yamaki-brand guitar is likely to be from the golden era and will be worthy of serious consideration. Happy hunting.', 'About the author: Gary Cooper is a journalist working in the musical instrument and pro audio fields. He edits Music Instrument News (the UK MI industry trade magazine) and Acoustic Review. Gary also contributes to a number of other music magazines and websites.

There were two main music stores in the city centre—Frank Hessy’s and (the dual-named) Rushworth and Dreaper—and they would have gone out of business if they only serviced The Beatles. Fortunately, they had more or less the entire Merseybeat community coming through their doors to acquire guitars.', 'One of the musicians among that community was Tony Crane of The Merseybeats. At first, however, he wasn’t involved in beat music.', '“I wanted to be a trumpet player like Eddie Calvert,” Tony told me, “and I became quite competent on the trumpet.” But the turning point for the teenager came when he saw the 1956 Elvis movie Love Me Tender. “My whole life changed! I asked my brother-in-law to teach me some chords on the guitar. So it was all because of Elvis, really.”', 'In that same year, 1956, the skiffle craze in the UK refreshed folk songs with upbeat, acoustic performances, often using washboards for percussion. Soon the young boys wanted electric guitars, especially after Buddy Holly & The Crickets played the Philharmonic Hall in Liverpool on March 20, 1958.', 'Mike Pender of The Searchers walked back into the city centre blinded by the light. “I saw Buddy Holly at the Phil, and from that night onwards, everything I learned, everything I played, was based on Holly. Groups today have banks of amplifiers and speakers all over the place, and most times they still don’t get the sound they want. Holly came on stage with just a double-bass, drums, and one amplifier, but he brought the house down.”', 'Billy Kinsley, also from The Merseybeats, took note of the frontman’s own instrument: “Buddy Holly had a Fender Stratocaster, which looked great, but they weren’t available here. Colin Manley of The Remo Four was the first person I saw in Liverpool with one, and then his group became known as ‘the Fender men.’ They were excellent musicians and great guys. They were into The Shadows, and you would always hear incredible guitar playing from Colin.”', 'Colin Manley told me that, on reflection, he thought his group looked square. “We always dressed the same—green suits with shocking pink lining and pointed shoes. That’s the way the groups dressed then, but at least we didn’t copy The Shadows’ dance routines. Looking back, I’m glad that I could never play and dance at the same time.”', 'Not every musician was a good one. Veteran manager Ted Knibbs saw one group at a social club. “After they’d done their turn, I said to the lead singer, ‘I’ll just give you a bit of advice. Throw that blinking guitar away and concentrate on singing, because you can’t play it.’ That was Billy J. Kramer.”', 'The advice stuck, and soon Billy left the playing to a group from Manchester, The Dakotas. Their lead guitarist was Mike Maxfield. “When we turned professional, I played a Guild guitar,” Mike remembered. “I was sponsored by Guild and I got the guitars free, so I can’t think of a better reason for playing one. Can you?”', 'The groups from Liverpool who went to play in the clubs of Hamburg had the bonus of watching a master guitarist at work: Tony Sheridan from Norwich. In terms of originality and innovation, Sheridan had the potential to be a star and a major player, but he lacked the ambition and the application. Local guitarists dubbed him The Teacher because they learnt from him.', '“It was like going out to Germany with an old banger and coming back with a Rolls-Royce,” Johnny Hutch, drummer with The Big Three, said. “The Beatles owed everything to Sheridan, because they copied him to a T. They copied his style on guitar. Sheridan was a fantastic guitarist, the governor.”', 'Gerry Marsden, whose high-guitar stance was pure Sheridan, acknowledged the influence. “Tony Sheridan was a genius, a great guitar player,” he told me. “I used to watch Tony every night, and he influenced me a great deal, not so much in his singing as in his rhythm. He drove like mad and I nicked a lot of his ideas.”', 'There was also some distinctive playing to be heard on “Needles And Pins” by The Searchers, but one of the group’s guitarists, John McNally, said that most people have the story of that sound wrong. “It’s a myth that there is a 12-string guitar on ‘Needles And Pins,’” he said. In fact, he recalled playing a Hofner Club 60 and Mike Pender a Burns Vibra-Artist.', '“Our engineer, Ray Prickett, put a little reverb on both guitars and, suddenly, we had this harmony. When the reviews came out praising our 12-string sound, we nipped out and bought a couple. From ‘When You Walk In The Room’ onwards, we used them on nearly everything,” McNally said.', 'Meanwhile, the double-bass was on its way out, and it was being replaced by the new electric bass guitar. Dave Lovelady of The Fourmost had fond memories of seeing Rory Storm & The Hurricanes.', '"One night at St. Luke’s Hall in Crosby was an absolute sensation. Rory Storm walked in the hall along with his bass player, Wally Egmond, who had the first bass guitar in Liverpool. There was electric bass on some American records, but we’d never seen one," Lovelady said. "Now, here was Wally with a Framus four-string bass guitar, and the other groups crowded around in amazement. They opened with ‘Brand New Cadillac,’ and the deep, booming sound was tremendous.” (You can hear that moment on the RockStar CD Rory Storm And The Hurricanes Live At The Jive Hive, March 1960.)', 'John Gustafson of The Big Three took matters into his own hands. “The first bass I played was just an ordinary guitar with bigger notches cut in the nut at the top. Lumps were cut out of it and bass strings put on,” Gustafson said. Adrian Barber, The Big Three’s first guitarist, made it for John. “He cobbled it together as a Heath Robinson job, as there was no way I could have afforded a bass guitar on my £2 10s weekly wage. I knew double-bass players played with their fingers, but because this was called a guitar, I thought that it must be played with a plectrum.”', 'Alan Stratton from The Kansas City Five was also indebted to The Big Three’s Adrian Barber: “Tony Jackson of The Searchers had made his own bass guitar. He had modified it and it was a copy of a Fender. I asked him where he got the machine heads, and he said from the violin department in Rushworth’s. So I popped along and did the same thing: I got cello machine heads. And Adrian Barber made a coffin-type amplifier for me. That deep bass thumping away was the very essence of Merseybeat.”', 'Tony Crane said that he’d never heard a bass guitar as loud as when you went down and listened to what was going on in the Cavern. “Adrian Barber of The Big Three had made coffin amplifiers for some of the bands. He would put an 18-inch speaker in a big box, and it would look like a coffin! You would carry it in like a coffin, and it would stand at the back of the stage. The Big Three were first, and then The Beatles had one, and then us. The whole sound of the band changed, because we had a big deep bass going. It would vibrate around the walls, and the chairs would vibrate too.”', 'Billy Kinsley started with a Burns bass guitar, which he bought from Hessy’s. “It cost me half-a-crown [12.5p] a week. When Tony Crane and Aaron Williams got big Gibsons, my little Burns looked out of place, so I swapped it for a big Hofner bass, like the one Stuart Sutcliffe had. The swap was with the bass player from Tommy Quickly & The Challengers. It looked fine, but when I got it home, there were two six-inch screws holding the neck onto the body. I was going to take it apart and see what I could do, but someone said, ‘No, if you take those screws out, it will fall to bits.’ I left it like that, and I couldn’t get the action down on it, but it was a good bass and it looked the part.”', 'Chan Romero was in Liverpool recently.

Feel free to pause for a moment and contemplate the glorious possibilities of this concept. It was not until several years later, after the utter failure of this wallpaper idea (as well as several others), that the team at the Sealed Air company decided to try marketing bubble wrap as protective packing material to the then-fledgling computer industry. IBM took them up on their pitch, and the rest is history.', "You might be wondering what this story has to do with electric guitars. Well, not that much really, but it is a colorful and illustrative example of the dichotomy that often exists between a product's original intent, and where it ultimately finds its place in the market.", 'There are, in fact, many such stories in the guitar industry. More than a few of them have to do with bass amplifiers.', 'In the beginning of the electric era, tube amps were just not terribly powerful, and they were next to impossible to keep clean at live band volume levels. For guitarists, this was not so bad, and many quickly grew to love the warm grit of a smaller tube amp pushed to its limit. For bassists, however, the situation was far less satisfying.', "Fender's Precision Bass came out in 1951—the first production-model electric bass guitar ever—but an amplifier designed specifically for it did not appear in music stores until 1952. Even then, this amp was rated at a mere 26 watts, not even close to enough power to keep up with a loud drummer, particularly if any sort of moderately clean tone was desired.", "Cleanly amplifying low-frequency sounds requires substantial headroom, and these early tube amps were just not up to the job. It wasn't long, however, before guitarists started plugging into some of these underpowered bass amps, giving them a whole new life. This legacy is an important one, as more than a few of today's prized vintage guitar amplifiers were originally designed with bass in mind. Let's look at a handful of notable examples.", 'The story of the Fender Bassman is well-known. Originally released in 1952 to pair up with Fender\'s new Precision Bass (released a year earlier and already taking the world by storm), the first Bassman was a 15" combo amp rated at around 26 watts, powered by a pair of 5881 vacuum tubes. It wouldn\'t take the more familiar narrow-panel, tweed 4x10 combo form until around 1954, which also saw the power increased to a somewhat more robust 40 watts.', 'It was quite successful as a bass amp in the beginning, largely because there were very few other options, but as bassists began to demand ever-more volume and clean headroom to compete with loud drums and guitars, the Bassman fell out of favor with the four-stringers, while simultaneously developing a reputation as a stellar guitar and harmonica amp. Fender took notice and began to market it as an all-purpose instrument amplifier.', 'Today it is legendary among guitarists for its sensitivity and creamy overdrive characteristics, and for its influence on the Marshall JTM45, which was basically a shameless 1959 Bassman copy assembled with British components. Consequently, vintage models have become exceedingly valuable.', 'Readers are undoubtedly familiar with the Marshall 100-watt 1959 Super Lead amplifier. Slightly lesser known is the model 1992 Super Bass, which of course was the bass version of the same amp, tweaked for extra headroom and a darker, more bass-friendly voicing and EQ. The differences in circuitry are slight, with the two amps being the same in most regards, including the use of EL34 power tubes. As a bass amp the Super Bass was certainly no slouch. It was responsible for the grinding rock tones of players like Jon Entwistle, Lemmy, Jack Bruce, Chris Squire, and others.', "It was known to lack deep low-end, however, which was an ongoing source of frustration for many bassists, and even its mighty 100 watts of power wasn't quite enough to deliver clean bass reproduction at stadium-rock volumes. As bass players looking for clean, extended low-end began to move on from the SB, guitarists began snatching them up, finding in them an interesting variation of the classic Marshall sound. And because the differences in circuitry are minimal, converting a Super Bass to Super Lead specifications was a simple job.", "Today, Super Bass models are nearly as valuable and coveted as Super Leads, with players from Adam Jones of Tool to Free's Paul Kossoff being associated with them. And they're still amazing for filthy Motörhead-style bass tones.", "1969 saw the release of Ampeg's legendary SVT bass amp, a 300-watt monolith that once-and-for-all delivered what bassists had been yearning for – an amp that could deliver big, bottom-heavy bass with perfect cleanliness and clarity at incredible volume. '69 also saw the release of the V series guitar amps, including the V-4, a 100-watt, 7027A-powered head notable for its burly tones and formidable output. Curiously, the V-4 began to catch on with rock bass players of the day as well, who took a liking to its power and throaty bark.", 'Ampeg cottoned on and in 1971 released the V-4B, a bass V-4 that was essentially unchanged from the guitar version but for its lack of onboard reverb. The company developed a matching 2x15 cabinet to go with it, even though many bassists had been previously using the matching 4x12 with great success.', "The V-4B developed a following and has become prized among bassists for its ability to get classic SVT tones at manageable volume levels, making it an excellent choice for studio work. It has traditionally been far more popular with guitarists, however, and today it is widely considered interchangeable with the V-4 (if you don't need the reverb).", "With guitar, sitting atop a 4x12 or two, the V-4/V-4B is a shockingly loud amp that offers tremendous clarity and headroom, and a deep, powerful bottom end that has contributed to its iconic status among stoner and doom guitarists. It's also a fantastic amp for pedals and effects. No doubt noting the increasing value of vintage V-4Bs, Ampeg reissued the head in 2014. By all accounts the reissue nails everything people loved about the original, and it has remained popular.", "Originally released during the Silverface era of the 1970s as a student model practice amp, the Fender Musicmaster Bass combo was rated at a fierce 12 watts, powered by a pair of 6AQ5 valves (later changed to a pair of 6V6s) and outfitted with a rather flimsy Oxford or CTS 12-inch speaker. As one might imagine, it wasn't anything to write home about as a bass amp. That said, it did fulfill its original purpose as an affordable bedroom practice tool and remained in production from 1970 through 1982. In the present day, however, its story is somewhat reminiscent of the Bassman.", "Cast aside by bassists looking for more clean power and low-end definition, the Musicmaster Bass has been re-discovered by guitarists. It has long been considered the ultimate sleeper among Silverface-era combos, common on the used market and much less expensive than other vintage Fender tube models. As a guitar amp, its 12-watt output is more than sufficient, and it really barks and sings when properly cranked up. It's also a fantastic pedal platform, particularly for recording work and smaller gigs. The Musicmaster Bass has become much more coveted in recent years, as word of its prowess has spread on various gear forums, but a well-preserved example can still be had for 400 to 500 dollars.", "There are various modifications that can be done to make it more useful for guitar, but for most people a simple speaker change might be all that's required, as the original speaker is notoriously poorly suited for its job. The Musicmaster Bass is also said to be quite sensitive to various tube types, so some experimenting is usually required to find the ideal tube complement for any particular amp.", 'Its nickname is "the Canadian Plexi," and like its more famous British predecessor, the original Traynor YBA-1 is basically a 5F6A Fender Bassman circuit running on EL34s. At 40 watts, it is superb for grungy, aggressive bass tones at moderate live band volumes, but it really shines when used as a guitar amp, where its full-throated power and appealing similarity to early Marshalls comes to the fore. With a handful of minor circuit tweaks (easily executed by any reasonably competent tech) it can be converted into a spectacular JTM/Plexi clone.', 'The YBA-1 was the king of all vintage sleepers for several decades, but word has recently gotten out about its capabilities (thanks in part to positive forum chatter and articles such as this one), and prices have steadily been going up.', "That said, an example in excellent condition can be had for around 600 dollars, often with the Plexi conversion already done. Traynor also reissued the amp in 2013, in the form of the YBA-1 Bass Master Tribute, a head that successfully captures the tone and mojo of the late-'60s originals, but with a few modern upgrades, including solid-state rectification and a built-in power attenuator that can take it down to 20, 10, 5, or even 2.5 watts, increasing its all-around usefulness dramatically over a vintage model.", 'The legacy of underwhelming vintage bass amps that have subsequently gone on to fame and glory in the hands of guitarists is an important one. After all, where would we be if some curious guitarist of yore had never thought to plug into that tweed Fender Bassman their bassist cast aside, or that lonely Marshall Super Bass sitting unused in the rehearsal room?', "The sound of quite a few essential rock 'n' roll records would be very different, indeed. So, next time you're hanging out in the jam spot waiting for the bass player to show, fire up the bass rig, plug in a guitar, and strum a few chords. You never know where it might take you.", 'Have your own favorite bass-turned-guitar amplifier?

He'd been through a couple of old-style Les Paul Bursts, both of which had been stolen from him during the last nine months or so. Maybe he was starting to feel that Les Pauls were somehow jinxed? Whatever the reason, he went out and found a used SG. A few days later, he took it to Marijke Koger and Simon Posthuma, two Dutch pop artists working in London.", "Christopher Hjort's book Strange Brew logs a rare day off for the busy Eric on March 13, and that's probably when he acquired the circa-'64 cherry finish Gibson SG Standard. We know that he used it on March 15, because the sound of the guitar's Vibrola is there on some demos Cream made that day in London. He was pictured with it a couple of days later, still with its original finish, at a gig in Essex.", 'Eric was familiar with the advantages of humbucking pickups and the regular Gibson control layout from those earlier Lesters, but this guitar had a quite different double-cutaway sculpted body. Like many an SG player, he must surely have appreciated the access and range and lightness of the instrument. And he always had an eye for a good-looking item.', 'Eric also had by now a suspicion that older guitars were better than new ones. When a magazine asked for guitar-buying advice, he said: "When you\'re starting, always buy a secondhand guitar, because it will be \'broken in\' and easier to play, apart from the fact that the older the guitar the better it seems to have been made." That summed up neatly the argument in favor of vintage guitars in one prophetic and influential sentence.', 'Soon after the March 17 gig, he went off to see Marijke and Simon. Marijke told me that she and Simon had moved to London in 1966.', '"We found a great Georgian-style place for rent in St. Stephen\'s Gardens in Bayswater," she says, "quite run down and dilapidated, but with large rooms. We had two floors, the upper story being the studio with plenty of space to paint and store artwork. This is where we met with the Cream guys for hanging out and photo shoots, as well as with other celebrities later."', 'Marijke and Simon became better known later as The Fool—an art collective and also, briefly, a band—and so Eric\'s SG is often called "The Fool" SG.', "You may have heard of Marijke and Simon for their work with The Beatles, notably the mural they painted later in '67 on the Apple boutique in London (although the shop's neighbors had no taste for psychedelia, and the local council soon had it removed). For now, though, the duo painted Eric's SG along with Jack Bruce's Fender VI and Ginger Baker's bass drum heads.", "Jack disliked the feel of the paint and replaced his Fender with an EB-3, a Gibson SG-shaped bass. Eric was more appreciative. Marijke and Simon's colorful work on the body of his SG featured a playful winged sprite playing a triangle, its curly hair not unlike Eric's look of the time, its toes poised near the controls, and all this set among stars and flames and clouds on a background of blues and purples and greens.", "The pickguard had a separate scene. A path stretched back to a fat red sun looming over distant mountains, while graduated curves in oranges and browns and yellows followed the body's cutaways, echoed in waves of color on the headstock and the rear of the neck. On the back of the body were more colored waves and an intense set of concentric circles, which ranged from greens through to reds and on to bright yellows at the centre.", 'Eric wrote later in his autobiography that the artistic duo had turned his guitar into "a psychedelic fantasy," and it\'s hard to argue with such a concise description.', "When he got the SG it had an original Deluxe Vibrola, the type with the long plate and a lyre-and-leaves motif on it, which points to the guitar's manufacture as between 1963 and '65. Almost immediately, he removed the cover plate from the Vibrola, maybe to reveal more of the artwork. Soon he disengaged the Vibrola altogether, at first leaving the arm pointing backwards and out of the way.", "Later, into '68, Eric had the Vibrola's arm and mechanism removed, leaving the remaining frame as a simple, sturdy tailpiece. He replaced the guitar's original Kluson tuners with robust Grovers, a popular move at the time and one he was familiar with from his Les Pauls. Paint began to flake from the back of the neck, which must have made for an unpleasant handful, and he had at least some of the extra paint there permanently removed.", 'In March \'68, the film director Tony Palmer sat Eric down with an interviewer on stage before a show at Winterland in San Francisco to chat about guitar playing. Eric patiently showed how the controls of his psychedelic SG worked. He explained that being a guitarist was a useful way to "play out" frustrations, because you could channel pent-up anger through the guitar by playing aggressively.', '"Not the way I use it," he clarified, "but that can be done, too, with people like The Who, Pete Townshend." The interviewer asked for a demonstration. "What," Eric said with a grin, "you want me to break the guitar up?" Apparently not, mercifully—and Eric proceeded to demonstrate musical aggression for the camera.', "He became fond of The Fool SG. He managed to successfully avoid the guitar thieves, too, playing the decorated instrument as his main stage guitar through the rest of '67 and on into the summer of '68. He recorded with it extensively, too, not least on a lot of Disraeli Gears.", "Soon, Eric would leave his Gibsons behind, including that wonderful SG and a couple more recent favorites, a Firebird I and a 335. He became a confirmed and, as it turned out, long-term Stratocaster fan. As for the painted SG, at some point he may have given it to George Harrison, but it certainly ended up with Jackie Lomax, a musician friend of George's from the old Liverpool days.", 'Around 1971, Todd Rundgren acquired the guitar from Jackie. Todd replaced the remains of the Vibrola with a stopbar and an incongruous Schaller "harmonica" Tune-o-matic. He also had the body paint restored and sealed, and he had someone replace and re-paint part of the neck and the headstock.', 'Todd occasionally played the ex-Clapton SG until the mid-\'90s, nicknaming the guitar Sunny as a nod to Eric\'s use of it on "Sunshine Of Your Love." Eric put together some of his guitars for an auction in 1999 to benefit his Crossroads charity, and he asked Todd to donate the SG. Todd declined, because of tax complications, but the following year he sold the guitar in an online auction for $120,000 and gave a percentage to Crossroads. The guitar was apparently sold again later for a sum said to be closer to $500,000.', 'After he disposed of the original, Todd sometimes played a replica of The Fool SG, as on a series of concerts in 2010 where he re-created his albums Todd, Healing, and A Wizard, A True Star. Eric, meanwhile, kept mostly to his Strats and showed no signs of returning to his psychedelic past.', 'Marijke Koger, one of the artists responsible for the look of the Fool guitar, has explained that the single thread running through all her paintings is nostalgia for paradise, which she says embodies hope for a better world, one with more joy, beauty, and peace.', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

Before we started the interview, he was keen to tell me who I should trust and who I should be wary of among the other ex-Fender people I was talking to on my trip. When I thanked him for the information and assured him I would make up my own mind, he seemed unimpressed.', "It became evident after I pushed the record button on my cassette machine that Forrest's years at Fender had been a magical time in his life, and that he had forthright views on the value of his own contributions to the company as well as those of his colleagues.", 'How did you meet Leo Fender, Forrest?', "I was an industrial engineer at Goodyear Aircraft in Ohio back in the '40s, and they sent me out from Akron to Los Angeles to write the procedure for building the tail section of the Lockheed P-38 fighter plane. I more or less fell in love with California, and I came back to visit a couple of times.", "Anyway, there was a show in Akron with a few artists—this is after I had built my own solidbody guitar, must have been 1948, '49 maybe—and I heard this steel guitar, fantastic sound. I thought Wow, that sounds great.", 'I didn\'t recognize the guitar or the amplifier. So I went backstage after the thing was over, talked to this guy Bob Foster who was the steel guitar player with Cowboy Copas. I pointed at his guitar, his amplifier, asked what it was. And he said, "That\'s made by Fender." Fender? I\'d never heard of it. He says, "Well, it\'s a place in Fullerton, California."', "I was so impressed with the sound that when I came back to California to visit in the late '40s I made a point to look up Leo Fender and meet him. That's when he took a picture of me with my 10-string steel guitar I had built—he was so impressed with it. I met Paul Bigsby the same day, the guy that made that solidbody guitar for Merle Travis. Then I went back to Akron, and I didn't think much more of it.", "In 1951, we moved out to California, landed up in Riverside—I became an industrial engineer for a company up there. I went round to have lunch with Leo one day, this would have been the spring of '54. Freddie Tavares had just started to work for him, in September of '53. George Fullerton had the title of production foreman. Now, thing is, George really didn't have much to… but that's another story, really.", 'Leo said to me, "Hey, I\'m having trouble with management." Freddie had told him the thing\'s ready to go down the drain. Fender was almost on the rocks. He had no credit whatsoever, had to pay cash buying any material and so on. Some of the employees\' checks were bouncing.', 'Freddie told me later that after he started with Leo in \'53, one evening he and Leo sat down after working hours, and Leo says, "Freddie, what are we gonna do? We have serious problems." That\'s when Freddie told him there was no one in the plant that could do what he needed done, so he\'d have to bring someone in from the outside.', 'Sounds like your timing was good.', 'It just so happened that my timing was right. I had no idea that Leo had problems, so I went down, had lunch with him one Sunday, and he says, "Hey, I\'ve been looking for someone for some time with your experience to help me with the management of the company. Would you be interested?"', 'I said, "Well, Leo, I\'ve got a pretty good job now. I\'m not sure whether I\'d be interested or not." I told him I\'d like to take a look at the operation. Well, I looked at it. And it was a mess. There was no planning whatsoever—because Leo was not an engineer, he was an accountant. They had just moved into his place at 500 South Raymond, and he had four buildings there, 40 by 120. Things had just been set down any place.', "You know, in manufacturing you should have a flowchart so that things run slowly, from one operation to another. Man! Everything was just so mixed up, you can't believe it. There was no planning whatsoever, because in all fairness to him he didn't have any experience in things like that. George was a former truck driver, so he didn't have any experience either. I looked at that and thought, Oh my lord! Wow!", 'You must have felt like walking right out again.', 'Yeah [laughs]. I said, "Leo, what kind of a production control do you have?" He asked me what I meant by that. I said, "Well, how do you know when it\'s time to order parts?" He told me that was easy and offered to show me. He took me to the stockroom, and—now, understand that Leo was my dear friend. He told me that I was the closest friend he had in this world. But anyhow, everything was all messed up. And George didn\'t know the difference. He just thought everything was fine.', 'When they\'d run out of parts, people would walk slowly down to the stockroom, look around for their parts themselves—I couldn\'t believe this! I said, "Leo, I\'ll come in and help you, but it depends on one thing. If I can have a free hand to do what I know has to be done, fine. Otherwise I\'m not interested."', 'He gave me that free hand. When I stepped in, from that point on I ran the company. He stayed in design, but I ran it. I set up a production control system that we used throughout the years. We never ran out of anything. Things went on from that point.', "How many people were working there when you started in '54?", "Around 40 when I started. And when CBS came into the picture, in '65, we had about 800. It grew gradually, just a constant uphill. Worked all kinds of hours.", 'And how many guitars were Fender producing when you joined?', "When I started with Leo, the production was very low, that was in May of '54. The Stratocaster had been designed but there was no production yet, so they had the Telecaster, the Esquire, and the Precision Bass [and some steels]. They had the Pro Amp, the Super Amp, the Bassman [and a few other amps]. The first production run of the Stratocaster was in October of 1954, then later the Jazzmaster came along, in '57.", 'What did you change first to make production run smoothly?', "As fast as I could, I rearranged the whole darn plant. Everything got separated—the guitars and the amplifiers, for one thing. Everything then had a constant flow. Then I set an incentive, and I tied the incentive into quality control. You take chances if you set in an incentive plan and you don't tie it in to quality control. Because people turn the thing out and to heck with the quality.", 'It was set up so that each operator was an inspector. So if you were on an assembly line and you did your job before it passes on to me, if it came over to me and I saw there was something wrong there that you hadn\'t done right, I\'d say, "Hey, take it back Tony, do it right, and then I\'ll accept it." So every operator was an inspector, too. And if they had to rework it, it was on their own time.', "As long as they turned out good production that passed, they made good money, darned good money. But if someone loused up, hey, once I accept it, then it's my problem. Follow me? So I tied this incentive into quality. George didn't know anything about it, Leo didn't know anything about it—I had to take care of it all myself.", 'What were the reactions of musicians to those early guitars?', 'Oh, they loved \'em. Now the dealers, they were wary. "Hey, what kind of a thing is this? Man, here\'s a board with strings on it." When the guitar was first shown in Chicago, I guess you know, they called it the toilet seat with strings, the canoe paddle.', "Then the following year, when he brought out the electric bass, anyone who wondered whether he was crazy or not, well, then they knew he was crazy. Who in the world is gonna play an electric bass? [Laughs.] Leo Fender is a nut! Well, today, you try and find an upright bass. It's pretty hard.", "What was the construction process in the mid-'50s, after you'd sorted things out?", "There was nothing as far as sophisticated tooling. We didn't have the money for anything like that. So, we bought our lumber—it would come in as long lengths, 18, 20 feet long, ash or alder, whatever we were making. We'd make the Telecasters out of ash, because of the blond finish. You'd cut the bodies into the proper length, glued together, so you'd have a block of wood that was the size of a guitar body.", "We had what we called router plates made out of quarter-inch steel, the shape of the guitar body, two different plates. You'd attach one to the bottom with a couple of screws there—you could drill on the one side where the neck plate and everything went, and on the other side where the pickups and everything ran.", "So you always had a minimum of two plates, sometimes three, depending on how sophisticated the instrument was. The thing was down there and you'd screw that on, you'd trace around and bandsaw it roughly to shape, and then on the router you'd rout around and take off the excess.", "Then the necks. For ovaling, we had a couple of holders swinging back and forth, and then there was a mandrel that had the holes cut out for the frets. Actually, most of the power tooling—I'm not talking about punch presses and things like that, because we made all our metal parts, too—but Leo designed all of the tooling, or most of it, himself.", "Leo was sharp mechanically, even though he was not an engineer. The man was sharp as a tack. The tooling was very simple, but it was a case of you had to crawl before you walked, walk before you ran. We didn't get any computerized routers and so on like they have today, where you can cut out half a dozen necks at a time. It was one at a time back then, and everything was simple. Crude, really, but it got the job done.", 'Did it change much over the years you were there?', 'Not too much, really. Later on we had better sanding equipment. And where we used to glue the bodies together with separate little C-clamps and put them on the floor, we got one of these big clamps that ran on a deal—it was improved to a certain extent. But, again, nothing like they have today.', 'What was the relationship like at Fender between you in the factory and the sales department?', "Well, here's something that'll amaze you. From the time I started in 1954 until the time CBS took over in January 1965, I was not allowed to have any information at all on the inventory or back-order situation from Fender Sales. The reason being that Leo and [Fender Sales boss] Don Randall didn't get along at all. If you can imagine it, I had to run that company guessing what they had in inventory. Now stop to think about that.", 'As the company grew, I didn\'t know whether to run Telecasters, Stratocasters, Jazzmasters—I had to guess. And then when I asked Don for the information he said, "It\'s none of your business." Now Don and I are good friends today, you understand? We were friendly enough then, but where I had the problem was that I was in between Leo and Don. They really didn\'t get along, and each one\'s bouncing off of me. I had to run that company. I made the decisions, no one else.', "Why didn't Don and Leo get on?", 'Because these two people wanted things their way, and neither would tell the other what they were doing. They were both like that.', 'Can you give me an example?', "Leo would design a line of amplifiers—they might have 14 different models of amplifiers. Don would order a new bunch of covers, then find out Leo had redesigned the amplifier line and nothing would fit. So yeah, we had a lot of fun like that! People don't realize some of the fun we had.", "But I tell people that the best thing ever happened to Leo was the fact that he met Don Randall and that Don took over sales. Because you can have the best product in the world, but if people don't know about it, it doesn't do you any good. Don was able to market that product. Don made people Fender-conscious, told them we have a guitar here that is the best, we have an amplifier that's the best. He took it from there and promoted the darned thing—and I had to work like a devil to keep up the production.", 'What were your impressions of Leo Fender?', "Leo and I were very close. I had a relationship with him where I could tell him what I thought. I told him I want a free hand, and if I think something's wrong I want a free hand to tell you. That's the way it had to be.", 'Others have told me Leo was different from other people in the way he worked. Was that your impression?', "Very much so. Leo was a workaholic, he was just work, work, work. He was in that plant a lot of times when he shouldn't have been, when he was really feeling rough. But boy, he wouldn't give up. Things were pretty rough for him in the early days, you know, and he just worked like a demon. And I'll tell you something, he was always trying to perfect something.", "With those larger amps, there was hardly any two production runs that were the same as far as the chassis was concerned. Leo would go round and he'd be working on something that he thought he'd change in the amplifier. And I'd got the responsibility of running the plant. At that time, we'd be using maybe one resistor of one kind and ten of another on an amplifier.", "Well, he'd go in there and make a change, and maybe where the one was, we'd use six of those, and only two of the one we were using ten of before. So then the guy that was doing the testing, the guy at the head of the amplifier department, he'd wonder why he couldn't get his voltages to check out right—because all the voltages had been changed.", 'Dick Stout ran the amplifier thing, he says, "Forrest, I\'ve had it, I\'ve been working on an amplifier chassis out there, trying to get it to check out for the last three hours." And I find out Leo\'s been at it again, changed it and didn\'t say a thing. I said, "Dick, I\'ll take care of this." So I put on the bulletin board: "Notice: Any employee making any kind of production change on assembly or otherwise, without previous authorization from your immediate supervisor, is subject to immediate termination."', 'About 15 minutes later, Leo came in my office. "Blalalalalalalala! This is my company, you\'d think I\'d be able to do as I so-and-so please!" I says, "You can Leo, fine, it\'s your responsibility now. You take it over. From now on, I\'m gonna do just what you want me to do, but buddy, it\'s not my responsibility, it\'s your responsibility." And then I asked him what he wanted me to do first. "Blalalala!" I said, "Leo, if you take that sign down, then you run it. Not me." And I didn\'t have any more problems with him.', 'Sounds like the day-to-day could be difficult for you, especially with Leo.', 'Tony, I loved the guy. But I had to fight him in order to help him. I was the only one that did that. Now Don and Leo, the fights they had were just disagreements. Leo knew that when I had a fight with him I was trying to help him.', "I have a clock barometer at home that Leo gave to me, after he sold [Fender to CBS]. About 30 days after I let him out of the plant for the last time, he came over my house. Leo and Esther [Leo's first wife] lived right across the street from us. I drew the plans for his home, that's how close we were.", 'He came over, knocked on the door, big grin on his face: "Got something for you." I says, "What is it Leo?" Opened it up, here\'s this nice clock barometer, real expensive one, had a plaque on it: "To Forrest White, in appreciation of many things, Leo Fender."', "Leo was not one to give compliments. But he knew I had to fight him in order to help him. Leo was not a manager—because he didn't want to be a manager. This isn't what he did. He could come in the place in the morning, and buddy, he had something in his mind that he wanted to try. The place is burning down? Let it burn down—he wanted to do what he was on.", 'Maybe give me an example, Forrest?', "I'd been there maybe two or three months, and there was something came up that was real important and I felt Leo should be briefed on. So I go in his lab, said look, there's something I'd like to kick around with you. He had his head in an amplifier, working on it.", 'So I\'m waiting, waiting patiently. "I\'m sorry if you\'ve got a lot to do," I says, "but there\'s something I\'d like to tell you." Oh—and he mumbled something. So I tells him again, and he turns around, he slams the screwdriver down on the bench. "Look, I\'ve got my problems, you\'ve got your problems, now you take care of your problems and I\'ll take care of my problems!" And from that time on, I signed leases for the buildings, I made the decisions for expansions, all these things.', "Another example. He was so gun-shy that it took him a while before he would let me do too much to begin with. I remember when I went in, there was no place to hang my jacket. Here's the door, here's the window, and here's a little place about this long [Forrest puts his hands a few feet apart].", 'I told Leo I\'d like to put up a one-by-four board there with three hooks in it so we can hang our jackets. "I don\'t know Forrest, you better wait, I won\'t have time to do that." I says why, Leo? "Well, you know, I like to have things done a certain way."', 'I says, "Leo, let me tell you something. My dad was a building contractor, I can build a house from the ground up. So I think I have sense enough to put up that board with three hooks." I told him I have a level and I know how to use one, and to rest assured it would be neat.', "He was gun-shy because he had no one that he could trust to do the job. He'd been burned so many times, he was afraid to let anyone else do it, because people didn't seem to give a dang, or couldn't do it—one or the other.", 'So, finally I did the board and hooks, and then I told Leo I wanted him to look at it. "Here\'s a level, Leo. Check it." And he sort of grinned sheepishly. Leo wouldn\'t take a vacation the first year—he was afraid to take a vacation, afraid the thing would go down the drain while he was gone. It was the second year he took a vacation.', 'When he came back, he didn\'t tell me, but he told Karl [Olmsted] and Lymon [Race, at Race & Olmsted, Fender\'s tool-and-die supplier], he said to them, "I\'m almost afraid to go away again—the place is running better after I came back than it was when I left."', 'Did Leo give much credit when people came up with ideas for an instrument or an amp?', "Well, I didn't ever get credit on mine. I even drew the floor plan on Leo's home and didn't get any credit for it [laughs]. But you could tell Leo something, and you'd give him an idea. You could tell he'd be thinking, he'd be looking at you and thinking, see. Wouldn't say a thing, wouldn't agree that you'd even told him anything. Then later on it would show up on something.", 'So you came up with some ideas that turned up on the guitars?', "I was the one that came up with body binding. Leo didn't have anything to do with that, so don't let anyone tell you any different. The guitars I made with binding on were made for Buck Owens, in the early years.", 'I was at one of the music shows, and I told Fred Martin at the Martin company that I\'d like to put binding around a Telecaster but I didn\'t know a darned thing about it, what kind of adhesive to use, what material to use for the body. And he said, "Well, you stop by the plant and I\'ll show you." So I stopped by and they showed me how they cut the binding material, how they bought in the sheets and cut it into strips, showed me what kind of adhesive to use.', 'So I made these guitars for Buck Owens, and also I used ground-up glass in the finish to try to give it a sparkle. I made three Telecasters in case one of them went bad. One was for Buck, the other was for Don Rich, and then I made a Precision Bass, used the same color, sort of a grayish sparkle, and those instruments were the first ones that had binding [on the body].', 'After Fender Sales saw what they looked like, they said, look, would you like to make up a sunburst Telecaster and a blond Telecaster and put white binding on? So we showed them that. [The Custom Telecaster and Custom Esquire with bound sunburst bodies went into production from 1959.]', "Course, you couldn't do anything like that on the Stratocaster because of the shape of the body. Also, that pickguard material we used, where we bevelled round the side on a 45 degree angle, that was my baby too—I went to the company and said we wanted the stuff laminated.", 'Did you have to take care of things like the serial number system?', 'When I started there, I said to Leo, "How are you keeping track of your serial numbers?" He asked me what I meant. "I mean so people\'ll know when instruments were made." And he said, "Oh, that\'s red tape, I don\'t like that." Same thing with the control systems—he says, "I don\'t like red tape." I said, "Leo, I\'ll put in something that\'ll just be a minimum control, but we have to have a certain amount of control, or forget it."', "So as an example, what would happen is you've got a bin here. In the early years, 5,000 was a run. So you make the neck plates, all serial-numbered. So here they are, you dunk them in a pan, take them to the plater. Come back, dunk them in a bin. Now they're all mixed up. Let's say I had ten production runs. The one I ran first, it's still at the bottom of the bin. You understand where I'm coming from? There's no way, rhyme, nor reason.", 'So when people come up with, Oh, this was the way that you figure it out, I read that stuff and I say Fender fiction is what I call it—Fender fiction.', "You're saying there was no particular chronological scheme to the serial numbers. In that case, what were they for?", "Well, you had to have a number, because if you want to insure the instrument you've bought—it's number 0014, say—for insurance you've got to have a serial number on the instrument. Otherwise, how would you keep track of what you'd produced? And we'd have an invoice: Stratocaster number 0014, Telecaster 0152, whatever, so you had that list, and you had the serial numbers on back of what you sent to the sales office. And they had to check off to see if they had every instrument that they said they had. Otherwise there'd be no way of keeping control over that.", "Many old Fenders seem to have an individual character, don't you think?", 'Well yeah, and there was a reason for that. With Leo, musicians would come in and each musician had his own idea of how things should sound. So to begin with, Bill Carson had quite a bit to do with things when Leo first made the Telecaster and the Esquire. The bridge there had three sections, and Carson said to Leo there was no way he could get proper intonation, says there should be a separate bridge section for each string.', "So that's where Carson came into the picture on the Stratocaster, with six bridge sections, one for each string. No other guitar had that.", 'I guess there must have been some mistakes made during the time you were at Fender?', "The aluminum pickguards [which briefly appeared on early Jazzmasters and a few other models], they were a catastrophe. I told Leo that to begin with. It was his idea. I had worked on aircraft, and I said Leo, don't do that, you'll wear through that anodized finish and it'll look like the very devil.", "As far as shielding, it worked great. Looked nice to begin with—mount your controls on there, no problem at all—worked great as far as the electronic and mechanical end. But after the guy played it for a while, first thing you know you're wearing through the doggone deal. I tried to tell him. He didn't like that, but it was true. So that was a catastrophe.", "And in the early years he made some mistakes when he built some steel guitars with oak. Oak has acid that really eats up—I mean, it's very successful for furniture, but this oak he used, the acid from that, you can't believe what happened to the finish and the chrome parts. He had a big bonfire out back [laughs]. That was about the worst problem he had.", 'How many guitars were Fender making through the years you were there?', "We were making around 1,500 guitars a week when CBS took over the thing in January of 1965. When I started, in '54, we were making about 40 a week. So it grew gradually up to the time CBS bought it.", 'Do you think the quality of the guitars deteriorated after CBS took over?', "Oh, it was terrible. Again, it goes back to cost. They brought in some guy in purchasing, didn't know one thing about musical instruments. Someone comes in selling a bunch of magnet wire he wanted to clear out, made this boast that we were paying too much for everything, and boy he was gonna save the company all kinds of money.", 'So this idiot, to him, magnet wire was magnet wire—the heck with gauge and coating and everything—that was not important. He buys all this crap, and when I found out, I says, "Man, we can\'t make our pickups with this stuff, it\'s not the right specification." But I was told we were going to use it. Just imagine what\'s happening to the sound of the guitar.', 'They took away the incentive that was tied into the quality control. So the strings would be way too high off the neck, they played terrible—the quality just went out the cotton-picking window. Terrible. They practically ruined the company.', "After the end of the second year, they said, OK, we're ready to build this new series of amplifiers, the solid state crap that they wanted to build. [The shortlived Solid State series included versions of the Bassman, Deluxe Reverb, Pro Reverb, Super Reverb, Twin Reverb, and Vibrolux Reverb.] The way it was designed was terrible. You couldn't service the amplifier, real bad.", 'That was the first time I had seen it—they took purchasing and everything away, because they had their own specialists. CBS had a vice president for everything you could think of. I think they had a vice president for cleaning the toilets. You name it, whatever it was, it had a vice president.', "This series of amplifiers, I said there's no way I'm having anything to do with building that because that's not worthy of Leo Fender's name. I said I will not sign it off for production. And I was the only one loyal enough or thought enough of him. So I left CBS–Fender in '67. I didn't care what they did after that.", 'Tell me about the White amplifiers.', "Leo named a line after me. There was a student line we were going to build, in the heyday of Fender, the latter '50s, we were going to build three-quarter guitars and amplifiers for students only. He named the line after me, White, and we made an amp and a steel guitar.", "I couldn't make enough Fender guitars, so we never did get the White standard [Spanish] guitar made. There was a prototype made, but we never did get it made. Couldn't build guitars that fast.", 'That reminds me of something you mentioned earlier—I think you said you made a couple of guitars for yourself before you met Leo?', 'Yes, I built a solid guitar way before Leo did. Solidbody, standard, built my own pickups and the whole thing. I put in a circuit where you could just flip the switch and go from preset rhythm to lead. And that was 1944 that I made that solidbody guitar.', "Now the neck I had on that guitar, it had real sharp frets on it, could rip your fingers apart. I put that thing down—you really couldn't play it because of that neck. So I built a ten-string steel guitar that had a locking nut, in 1946, way before I even knew there was a thing called Leo Fender.", 'I saw Alvino Rey at the Paramount Theater in Akron, and he had to keep fiddling with his guitar when he wanted to change from rhythm to lead. I thought, Well, that\'s a bunch of garbage, there\'s no reason why he would have to do that. And then when I started working for Leo, I said to him, "What you need is a guitar where you can preset the rhythm and lead." Leo didn\'t play guitar, couldn\'t even tune a guitar. So he didn\'t think this was important.', 'Alvino Rey came in the plant one day, so I said, "How would you like to have your guitar fixed so you wouldn\'t have to mess around with the controls, you just flip the switch?" He says, "Well, can that be done?" I said, "Well sure, I already did it." So Leo brought the Jazzmaster out in 1957, and that\'s the first guitar that had the deal where you could switch between rhythm and lead. And that came from my guitar that I made back in the \'40s.', 'Was the Jazzmaster really aimed at jazz players?', "Not too much, it was mostly country western, and then when that rock'n'roll thing started up, well—I can't stand rock'n'roll. That's where the sound started, as you know. But it's one of those things where I have to ask forgiveness every night that I had anything to do with it, because to me, the way these guys get up and they play so loud, when you reach above a certain decibel in sound, to me it's not entertainment, it's torture. I can't stand it, it just drives me nuts.", "I like easy listening, nice soft music. I don't even like singing. I wish people'd keep their mouth shut and just play their instruments. A nice soft string section, that's my favorite music. I can't stand this rock 'n' roll crap.", 'How much influence do you think Fender had on other companies?', 'Man, the Stratocaster is the most copied guitar in the world—no other guitar is copied any more than Fender. Everyone tries to build a guitar looks like Fender. Les Paul would probably run second. I miss the music business so much. I miss those years, and I miss Leo.', 'About the author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music. He is a co-founder of Backbeat UK and Jawbone Press.

Read the rest of the series here:', "As the 1970s galloped boldly toward the '80s, developments in the available tech enabled dramatically different sounds to be encapsulated in unassuming little guitar pedals.", 'The results were heard most notably in some extremely spacey modulation and delay effects, but metalheads would reap the benefits of hard-hitting distortion units too.', "The effort to re-create the natural shimmering warble of a collection of voices or instruments singing or playing simultaneously had produced groundbreaking electro-mechanical effects almost since the dawn of amplification. Leslie's rotating speaker is the most famous such creation of the pre-transistor age (as discussed in this series' first installment), and that chorus-meets-vibrato sound was compacted down into a desktop unit in the form of the Univox (Shin-Ei) Uni-Vibe in 1968.", 'The transition to an actual effects pedal with footswitch as we know it today initially came, however, via a much bigger creation that incorporated chorus/vibrato circuitry as just a part of its overall capabilities.', "Roland released its JC-120 and JC-60 Jazz Chorus amplifiers in 1975. In addition to their impressive clean power, the built-in chorus/vibrato effect for which they were named became an instant hit with guitarists, in addition to the keyboard players for whom they were originally intended. A year later, Roland's sister brand Boss encapsulated the circuit in pedal form as the CE-1 Chorus Ensemble, and a classic was born.", "The CE-1 is bulky by today's standards, but purists will tell you that nothing else sounds quite like this unit's lush, multi-dimensional stereo chorus. Controls offer Level, Chorus Intensity, and Rate, and there's also a High/Low switch, a power switch (the CE-1 was AC powered), and footswitches for on/off and Vibrato/Chorus.", "One quirk of the unit is that, like the amps that preceded it, the circuit was originally intended to receive the line-level signal of electric keyboards, so an un-buffered guitar signal straight in can result in a slightly warm, muted tone. For some, that's part of the charm; others find their way around this.", 'Andy Summers is invariably singled out as a notable early CE-1 user. His guitar parts on The Police\'s "Message in a Bottle" are dripping with that juicy Chorus Ensemble tone, and you hear the effect used throughout much of his work with that band, and elsewhere.', 'Soon, just about every guitarist had to have the effect under foot—more often in the form of the Boss CE-2 of 1979, a two-knob pedal in the more compact Boss casing that would soon become so familiar, or as provided by the MXR Micro-Chorus, Electro-Harmonix Small Clone, and a host of others that swamped the market.', 'Enabled by much the same IC-based technology that brought us the chorus pedal, and a cousin to both chorus and phaser, the flanger twists its modulation capabilities to more dramatic extremes. Yet again, the pedal was devised in an effort to reproduce an effect previously—and laboriously—made in the recording studio.', 'Arguably pioneered by Les Paul (as were so many things), studio flanging was produced by playing two reel-to-reel tape machines together simultaneously with the same recording on each, then alternately slowing one machine (light thumb pressure on the reel usually did the trick) to send it in- and out-of-phase with the other. This is the flanging heard on classic recordings by Pink Floyd, the Small Faces, Eric Burdon & the Animals, Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, and later The Doobie Brothers, Hawkwind, the Eagles, and others.', "As re-created in pedal form, the key to the effect's function lies in its ability to split and harmonically tune the out-of-phase notches and, relative to these, the peaks within the signal. The combination creates a lush harmonic spacing between the two according to the speed of the unit's sweep and its depth or intensity. Used subtly, flanging can sound a little like a medium-depth chorus or phaser pedal. Used heavily and relentlessly, it gets more into the seasick-acid-trip realm.", "The A/DA Flanger of 1977 put this circuit in a rugged enclosure with stomp-switch and five control knobs, and is the undisputed king of flanging, but it wasn't the first on the market.", "Legendary effects designer David Cockerell devised the Electric Mistress circuit, released by Electro-Harmonix in '76, and most accounts indicate that the Ibanez FL-305 and Tychobrahe Pedalflanger hit the market the same year. The year after, MXR and Mutron got into the game alongside A/DA.", 'Significant pedal-based flanger recordings are heard in Billy Duffy\'s infectious guitar riff on The Cult\'s "She Sells Sanctuary," Robert Smith\'s guitars on The Cure\'s "Just Like Heaven" and "A Forest," Edward Van Halen\'s monstrous riffs on "Ain\'t Talkin\' \'Bout Love," and elsewhere.', "The literal concept of signal distortion had obviously been in use for years, ever since the first guitarist turned an amp up past the point of clipping or abused (or simply broke) some other piece of gear that emitted a distorted sound as a result. As with so much else in the '70s, though, guitarists were chasing methods of producing that fat, gnarly, rock-certified sound without cranking up 100-watt stacks to foundation-rumbling decibel levels. The distortion pedal was one method by which it was delivered.", "The distortion pedal was clearly kin to the fuzz and overdrive, but—while the three can merge in some ways at the extreme settings of one or the other—it's really quite different from either. The general intention of the distortion, as opposed to the fuzz's distinctively transistorized clipping and the overdrive's faux-tube-amp clipping, is to approximate a guitar amp that's being slammed, rather than just gently pushed. As such, it uses much of the same transistor, diode, or IC technology to get there, but the distortion just drives it all a little harder.", "MXR's Distortion+ of 1973 might lay claim to being one of the earliest examples of the breed, but by today's standards it's really closer to a medium-gain overdrive pedal than a true distortion.", 'The Boss DS-1 Distortion pedal of 1978 might, therefore, lay claim to "seminal distortion," and its sharp, edgy, cutting tone certainly delivers what we expect from this breed of breakup as opposed to softer, rounder overdrive. Shred supremos Steve Vai and Joe Satriani both used DS-1s early on, and the iconic Boss monster also helped kickstart the grunge phenomenon under the feet of Nirvana\'s Kurt Cobain.', "Another abiding classic is ProCo's RAT pedal of 1979. Founded in 1970, the Kalamazoo, Michigan company had specialized in cables, DIs, and other atonal devices until the guitar world demanded a better distortion in the late '70s, and ProCo delivered. Running from smooth, subtle degrees of clipping that might be categorized as overdrive, to edgy, jagged distortion, RAT pedals (or, later, Turbo RATs) have been used by Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters, Graham Coxon of Blur, Jeff Beck, and at least two of the three Radiohead guitarists, among—oh—about a zillion others.", "By the mid-'80s, every pedal maker worth its salt had a distortion on the market. Notables include DOD's FX55, out in '83, Ibanez's DS10 Distortion and Super Metal pedals, and Boss's DF-2 Super Feedbacker & Distortion.", "We'd had analog delay pedals for several years already by the time the first digital delay arrived in the early '80s, but this new technology—touted as the be-all and end-all of everything signal-processing—enabled previously unheard-of delay lengths, higher fidelity, and unprecedented parameter controls. It really did mark a great leap forward for echo in the process.", 'Today, guitarists who don\'t need particularly long delay times or more than the basic controls will often prefer the supposedly warm, slightly grainy sound of analog delay (with some digital delays having earned a reputation for being a little "cold" or "sterile"), but it\'s impossible to deny the "wow" factor that the early units brought to the table. In fairness, clever designers have devised plenty of digital units over recent years that can rival the best analog classics for warmth and richness of tone.', 'Larger and more complex rack-unit digital delays had existed for a couple years when Electro-Harmonix released its two-second Digital Delay (with Magna Storage and Echo Chorus, to give it its full name) in 1981. With sliders rather than traditional rotary knobs for the Echo Delay and Repeat, Chorus Depth and Speed, and overall output level, plus slider switches for effects selection and two footswitches for Bypass and Infinite Repeats, the unit was a formidable beast. The so-called Magna Storage also offered an unprecedented live-performance feature, too, in what was actually a sample/repeat loop capability.', "Two years later EHX's David Cockerell expanded digital capabilities exponentially in the legendary 16 Second Digital Delay. The real bragging point about this was, of course, its significantly more powerful looping capabilities… because, who really wants a note to echo back 16 seconds later in standard delay mode anyway?", "Boss scored what might have been the most popular digital delay of the era, though, with the DD-2 Digital Delay pedal of 1983. Housed in the traditional Boss enclosure, the DD-2 carried controls for E(ffect) Level, F(eed) Back, and D(elay) Time, in addition to a Mode switch that enabled delay times of 50ms, 200ms, or 800ms, and Hold. Notable users of the DD-2 or the DD-3 that followed it include Slash, Nuno Bettencourt, and Joe Walsh, but there are scads of others who added it to their pedalboards throughout the '80s.", "Also noteworthy in the mid-'80s were the PDS 1000 and PDS 1002 from DOD's DigiTech arm, with one and two-second maximum delay/sample capabilities, respectively, and these were a big hit with players seeking to add short loops to their playing repertoires in addition to the basic (and long) echoes onboard.", "Find the rest of the series below.

['The mid-to-late 1980s marked the beginning of what could undeniably be considered the golden age of digital multi-effects studio processors.', "The Yamaha SPX-90 and Lexicon's PCM 70, both released in 1985, successfully adapted algorithms from their flagship products into devices at a price point that placed high-quality reverbs, delays, and modulation effects within reach of musicians and smaller studios. Around the same time, Eventide released what would ultimately become a multi-effects staple, the H3000.", 'The H3000 was, in its designers\' own words, "a multi-effects monster," combining Eventide\'s standard-setting, pitch-shifting algorithms (now fully diatonic and stereo), along with delays, a comprehensive library of modulation effects, and powerful reverb algorithms—all in a modular, upgradeable package.', 'Whether in its original yellow-on-black cosmetics, the iconic gray-on-blue, or the later D/SE and "squiggle font" D/SX incarnations, the H3000 is immediately recognizable in the racks of the finest studios and producers around the world. And while vintage units can be had at reasonable cost, rest assured that most of the H3000\'s algorithms have been ported to software plugins.', 'This article explores both the under-the-hood technology of the H3000 and the developments at Eventide that ultimately led to its creation, beginning with the truly groundbreaking H910.', 'Released in 1975, the H910—"H" for "harmonizer," "910," a play on The Beatles song "One After 909"—was the first product in what would eventually become the company\'s Harmonizer line. Even by this early stage, Eventide had already left a lasting impression on the audio industry with its Omnipressor (a dbx VCA–based RMS compressor) and the 1745 delay, but it is the Harmonizer series for which the company is best known.', 'It is worth noting that Eventide also had —and still has—its hands in a number of other markets, including profanity delays for broadcast. A profanity delay lives between a broadcast studio and the air waves, allowing broadcast engineers time to catch and "bleep" obscenities before they hit the air—and before the broadcaster is hit with a fine from the FCC.', 'They also developed a tape counter for the Ampex MM1000 2" tape recorder—essentially an "autolocator," or remote control —which was so successful that Ampex made it an OEM product. Eventide also created moving map displays for aviation and a number of accessories and expansion products for Hewlett Packard computers, including RAM expansion boards priced to undercut HP\'s OEM offerings and an ethernet card.', 'Up to this point, analog pitch shift effects were largely limited to an octave up or two octaves down, and results bore little direct harmonic or tonal correlation to the original signal. Octave-up effects pedals relied on full-wave diode rectification to "flip" the negative-going portion of a waveform up, crudely doubling the frequency of the incoming waveform.', 'Octave-down pedals relied on an op-amp comparator to "convert" the incoming signal into a square wave, whose frequency was then halved and/or quartered using CMOS flip-flops (like the 4013 chips found in the MXR Blue Box and Boss OC-2 pedals).', 'Earlier pitch-change techniques relied on tape manipulation. The simplest method was to play a tape back at a different speed from which it was recorded, a technique employed to great success by Ross Bagdasarian on his Chipmunks novelty records. An alternative method utilized arrays of two or four tape-playback heads mounted on a cylinder that could rotate with or against tape passing over the heads, resulting in upward or downward pitch shifting.', 'One such device, the Eltro Information Rate Changer cost a staggering $3,950 USD in 1967 dollars (for reference, an LA-2A cost $395 at the time) and was utilized by The Beach Boys in "She\'s Goin\' Bald." Stanley Kubrick also used it in 2001: A Space Odyssey to "wind down" HAL 9000\'s voice as Dave deactivates him.', 'In contrast, Tony Agnello, the H910\'s creator and one of Eventide\'s earliest employees, used complicated arrays of off-the-shelf logic components to create a "largely analog device" that was able to shift pitch within a two-octave range. Pitch change on the H910 was expressed as a ratio, where a setting of "2.0" is an octave up, ".5" is an octave down, and "1.0" is no pitch change. To achieve the "micro pitch shift" effect for which the H910 is so well-known, users could shift pitch a few cents up or down by setting the Manual control to hover just above or below 1.0.', 'Interestingly, the ratio control wasn\'t entirely stable, and the pitch change ratio might occasionally move up or down by a few hundredths (say, between .99 and 1.01 when set to 1.0), unintentionally creating a more effective doubling effect. Eventide\'s H910 plugin faithfully recreates the hardware, imperfections and all. A stereo implementation of this effect (derived from a pair of algorithms from the later H3000) is also included as "Style I" and "Style II" on Soundtoys\' Microshift plugin.', "The H910 could also generate up to 112.5ms of delay digitally, all in the days before dedicated digital signal processing (DSP) chips were widely available. The first two iterations of Eventide's first delay product—the 1745/1745A—employed shift registers. These are logic circuits that pass individual bits within digital audio samples from one register to the next, and the next, and so on (like a digital, bit-level bucket-brigade device) to generate short delay lines. But the H910 used what is now the standard technique of storing samples in RAM to generate delay.", 'As high-quality A/D converter chips were unavailable at the time, the H910 used custom, discrete A/D conversion developed by Agnello (built on an earlier design by Richard Factor for the 1745 delay) and dbx 303 compander cards. These cards, which allowed the H910 to achieve an impressive >90dB dynamic range, are also a common culprit of non-functioning H910s. (D/A conversion appears, at least, in my own H910, to have been handled by Analog Devices AD7530 10-bit DACs.)', 'When pitch-shifting with a pedal or on a tape machine, you have likely noticed that changing your delay time will also change the pitch. On the H910, two delay lines were constantly modulated with ramp-wave LFOs. By crossfading between them, the processor could maintain a constantly changed pitch.', 'Tony Agnello says, "The H910 used simple cross fading between two varying delays that were offset in time, so that when one delay reached its limit (either zero or max delay), the other delay was mid-way through its excursion."', 'The technique was not without imperfections and limitations—some of which, like the constantly wavering pitch ratio, can be employed to creative effect—but the H910 was readily and eagerly adopted by the audio industry, including heavy-hitters like Brian Eno, Tony Visconti, Frank Zappa, Tony Bongiovi, Kevin Killen, and Flood.', 'The H949 succeeded the H910 in 1977, with the ALG-3/LU-618 "de-glitch" card as an available option (later models included the card). The ALG-3 card corrected the often-audible pop and click artifacts generated by the H910\'s wave-splicing pitch shift method.', 'This intelligent de-glitching system was made possible by the development of the Reticon 5105, an early charge-coupled device-on-a-chip. This was the same type of CCD used in digital imaging, radar applications, and—as it was similar to bucket brigade devices—audio delays.', 'According to Agnello, "I … designed the H949 using the Reticon [5101] chip as one step in my intelligent splicing method. The other steps remain proprietary."', 'The 5101 allowed auto-correlation operations to be performed. Auto-correlation, in a nutshell, compares two waveforms for similarity.', '"Circa 1972–3 [when the H910 was in development] auto-correlation was not possible," Agnello says. But, with the H949, Agnello was able to use the new technology to look for optimum splice points between the crossfaded delay lines, reducing glitches.', "A more in-depth technical breakdown of the technique can be found at the Valhalla DSP website and in Agnello's patent for the process, filed in April 1981.", 'The H949 also included a flange effect, extended delay times, infinite repeat (of the last 400ms\' worth of samples) reverse and random delays, feedback tone-shaping options, and a "micro pitch-shift" function. This µPC function restricts the range of pitch change ratio to about 0.93–1.07, depending on if the device is set to flat or sharp mode.', 'The H969 followed in 1983. However, according to Eventide founder Richard Factor, "It was a lot more expensive than the H949, and wasn\'t that much better. Also, we started making it during a time of turmoil during our move to NJ and it probably didn\'t get promoted as well. Therefore, it wasn\'t a big seller and there was less interest."', 'Over the course of a telephone conversation and email correspondence, Agnello emphasized the significance of an oft-overlooked Eventide product, the SP2016.', "Released in 1981 (again, before dedicated DSP chips were available), the SP2016 was a signal processor with 20kHz bandwidth and 16-bit conversion. It was truly the audio world's first software-based, multi-effects computing platform.", 'To be clear, other digital audio processing devices with user-adjustable parameters existed at the time (including the Lexicon 224 and the EMT250), but the SP2016 was designed more as a fully programmable computing platform for digital audio processing tasks.', 'In addition to running factory algorithms, third parties—including users—could write their own software algorithms in SPUDSystem, a dedicated SP2016 algorithm development environment written in Pascal for HP computers. By using this program, users could burn reusable EPROM memory chips and plug them in to the SP2016\'s available ROM slots. "Remove Panel to Access Plug-In EPROMS," a small label on the unit\'s top panel says.', 'This is why Eventide rightly claim first usage of the term "plug-in." This was absolutely unheard of at the time and remains an innovation largely overlooked by the larger audio engineering culture, though a little bit of internet sleuthing quickly reveals much love for the SP2016 from a who\'s who of engineering royalty.', 'SP2016: Under The Hood', 'The SP2016 employed an array processing architecture using a 16x16-bit multiplier and 32-bit accumulator microprocessor by TRW (whose own history is quite interesting). All digital audio processing occurred at 24 bits, fixed point. Array processors, also known as vector processors, execute a single instruction at a time but on an array (think matrix or table) of data.', "For reference, some widely known examples include the PlayStation 3's Cell processor and the IBM PowerPC Altivec co-processor found in G4 and G5 Macintosh computers. Most contemporary graphics processing units (GPUs) and computer CPUs employ some form of vector processing.", 'The TRW microprocessor was not designed specifically for audio use. It was essentially designed for general-purpose computing applications (array processors, incidentally, dominated the supercomputing industry in the 1980s and 1990s) and optimized in the SP2016 specifically for audio processing applications—it was, truly, an audio computing platform.', 'This differs from contemporary devices in a few significant ways:', 'AD/DA conversion was handled by Sony CX20018 and Burr Brown PCM75JG ICs, respectively. Interestingly, audio Input and Output level sliders were not simply analog faders. These sliders carried DC voltages that were sent to Analog Devices AD7524 Multiplexing D-A converters, through which analog audio passed. The 7524 varied the level of any audio passing through it, depending on the DC voltages received, much like a VCA.', 'The same method of using DACs to control analog levels was carried over into the H3000. This is also the same "multiplying DAC" technique used by SSL in all of their current moving-fader console offerings.', 'SP2016: Algorithms', 'Agnello hired Robert Belcher and Ken Bogdanowicz (who later left to create audio plugin company Soundtoys) to develop algorithms for the SP2016. While the most famous programs on the SP2016 are probably the reverbs—Room (mono in, stereo out), Stereo Room (stereo in/out), and Diffuse Plate—several other algorithms were available on EPROMS: Vocoder, Band Delays, Shimmer, Crystal Echoes, and Time Scrambler, among others.', '"People had trouble understanding what it was and what it could do. Digital reverbs, like the EMT, Lexicon, and Sony, were very popular products, and we confused a lot of people who just wanted a great reverb. We would have been better off if we had limited the box to just reverb," Agnello told Reverb in this 2018 article.', "If some of these algorithms sound familiar, it's because many of them would find themselves another home on the H3000.", 'For the reverb geeks out there, all reverb algorithms were of the feedback delay network (FDN) variety. From Agnello, "The 2016 reverbs were FDNs, but that terminology wasn\'t used by me. I was calling it a delay matrix but never published."', "While the SP2016 certainly hasn't maintained the level of visibility of its Eventide stable mates, its significance to later Eventide developments—let alone its contribution to the advancement of audio signal processing—cannot be understated. Agnello explained in an email:", '"As is sometimes the case, wildly successful products are designed by a team that designed the previous generation. The success of the H3000 cannot be understated, but the SP2016 is the reason that the H3000 design was possible, and, from a historical/academic perspective it\'s a story that has never been told. The SP2016 was the ground-breaking product. The H3000 was its commercially successful descendent."', 'For those interested in hearing the SP2016, it can be found all over the work of a number of high-profile engineers and producers. Agnello points to Mick Guzauski, George Massenburg, Allen Sides, Dave Pensado, and Jack Douglas.', '"It was the go-to reverb for them and many others, so it\'s on thousands of records from 1983 on. Allen Sides still uses the hardware but many people use the plugin version."', 'And while the SP2016 is probably best known for its reverbs, Agnello points out that “Suzanne Ciani credits Band Delays at being at the heart of her landmark album, Seven Waves.”', "Given the rarity of a functioning SP2016, they don't come up for sale often. Fortunately, the recently-released SP2016 Reverb finally captures the mojo of the cherished Room, Stereo Room, and Plate algorithms. Long-time SP2016 user Dave Pensado sings the plugin's praises in the following video:", 'The design brief for the H3000, according to an AES paper by Belcher and Bogdanowicz, "was to build a stereo pitch shifter and to do it quickly and inexpensively ... its audio quality needed to be better than any of our previous products. Additional effects, such as reverb, were thought of as possible features."', 'To keep costs down, Eventide again chose to use off-the-shelf silicon, specifically the Texas Instruments TSM 32010 digital signal processing chip. Agnello states, "The TI 32010 chip introduction convinced Eventide to migrate our development efforts to DSP chip-based hardware."', "The H3000's I/O and Conversion", 'Conversion was to be "at least 16-bit and processing with at least 44.1kHz sample rate," according to Belcher and Bogdanowicz. To this end, the H3000 used the same converters employed in the SP2016: Sony CX20018 ADCs and Burr-Brown PCM53JP-V DACs.', 'The Sony ICs were successive approximation converters—no oversampling here! And where most contemporary ADC/DAC ICs have on-board anti-aliasing/reconstruction filters, converters at the time lacked these faculties. The H3000s used Murata ALF89WB 9th-order low-pass filters with a 20kHz bandwidth on both ADC and DAC stages—large silver "hybrid ICs" in a SIP package.', 'Analog stages were TL07x-series operational amplifiers. At the time, these were substantially less expensive than NE553x ICs, while offering both a higher input impedance (due to JFET inputs) and a higher slew rate, with higher distortion and noise being the trade-off. Analog input/output levels were software-controlled using Analog Devices AD7524 (input) and AD7528 (output) MDACs to vary analog audio levels, again like the SP2016. Both Agnello and Richard Factor credit the analog I/O design to Dave Derr, best known as the brain behind Empirical Labs.', "The H3000's Signal Processing Architecture", "The H3000, like the SP2016, was designed to be software-based. That is, audio processing tasks weren't directly tied to a limited set of instructions built into a hardware-based device, like they were in the H910. The H910 could not be re-programmed later via a software update to perform additional audio tasks like flanging or phasing. The SP2016 and the H3000, on the other hand, could have additional algorithms and presets loaded into them by adding ROMs containing additional software. The SP2016 and H3000 were computing platforms made for audio processing—not just hardware devices designed to perform a finite set of audio tasks.", 'The way the SP2016\'s processing works is similar to the way UAD audio plugins are processed by dedicated DSP cards (or Thunderbolt boxes) attached to a computer: The plugin\'s user interface accepts input (parameter changes), but the instructions are ultimately passed by the "host processor"—in this case your computer\'s CPU—to the UAD hardware, which then applies an effect to audio in a DAW that is running on your computer (again, the host processor in this scenario).', "The core of the H3000 actually consists of three Texas Instruments TSM 32010 digital signal processing chips, with the software user interface operating on an 8-bit Motorola 6809 host processor. Here's how a parameter change would play out as a user manipulates delay time via the H3000's front-panel encoder knob:", 'At the time, no single-chip DSP option possessed the processing power required by Eventide\'s design spec for the H3000. So two possibilities were considered: "bit-slicing," where, for example, the first eight bits of a 16-bit word are processed by one DSP, and the remaining 8 bits are processed by another. This required expensive high-speed parts and would have made software development more difficult.', 'The second option—and the one ultimately chosen by Eventide—was to distribute audio processing tasks among a number of off-the-shelf DSP chips (in the case of the H3000, three TSM 32010s). This ended up being both more economical and easier to program, with TI offering excellent software support.', 'Different Versions of the H3000', "One of the more interesting things about the H3000 is that the various versions released over the device's 10+ year lifespan are based on largely identical hardware.", 'Later versions added more features like digital I/O and the optional sampling card (standard in the H3500), but the analog section, conversion, and the three TSM 32010s remained unchanged. The differences ultimately come down to the included algorithms and presets. The upshot is that even the oldest H3000s can be updated with the last OS version and every algorithm/preset ever developed.', "Again, this ultimately comes back to Eventide's forward-looking decision to design the H3000 as a software-based audio computing platform.", 'Curious about which H3000s came with which algorithms and presets? Consult this definitive Eventide H3000 Algorithm and Preset Chart.', 'And here are a few you might want to check out:', "Eventide's approach to building modular, expandable products first pioneered with the SP2016 and then the H3000 is reflected across their current product lineup, from guitar pedals like the H9 to their flagship multi-channel audio processor, the H9000.", "Eventide continue to develop new algorithms for the former, while the latter is designed around a multi-card ARM architecture designed with future upgradeability in mind. The H3000's longevity is not just a testament to the unit itself, but to Eventide's forward-looking and future-shaping use of the new technology of the time.", 'Ian Anderson is an assistant professor of music at Kent State University, where he teaches audio recording.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Namely, the echo chamber at Sunset Sound recording studio.', 'Before the abundance of reverb options made available by plates, springs, digital effects, and plugins, the only way to give recorded music an extra sense of space was to amplify vocals and instruments in a special room called an echo chamber, then mix the reverberant result back in with the dry recording.', 'While the echo chamber\'s true origins are fuzzy, Universal Recording founder Bill Putnam is often credited with the first recorded use of artificial reverb. In 1947, Putnam used his Chicago studio\'s bathroom as a makeshift echo chamber on The Harmonicats\' "Peg o\' My Heart," an instrumental ballad from 1912 covered by a trio of harmonica players. How\'s that for an origin story?', 'Before being supplanted by newfangled plate- and spring-based reverb devices, echo chambers saw peak usage in the 1950s and the 1960s (though of course some are still used to this day). During this golden era, the acoustical characteristics of these spaces played a critical role in defining the sound of countless popular songs.', "Because of this, many original echo chambers have retained a certain mystique—and the most famous of them are still used regularly, even in the current age of digital reverb. From the drafty attic of an old Midwestern house to a set of cavernous concrete bunkers buried underground, we've compiled a list of some of the world's most famous echo chambers (and the hit songs they brought to life).", 'Note: while nearly any room can be used for re-amping, this article will focus solely on dedicated echo chambers that were (or still are) permanently wired up for the sole purpose of piping music into them.', 'In 1958, Disney\'s director of recording, Tutti Camarata, proposed to Walt the idea of starting an in-house recording studio for film work. Legend has it that Disney responded by saying, "Why would I want to own a studio? I\'d rather be a client." So Camarata took the reins as an entrepreneur.', "He found a disused auto shop on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, which had been built with a sloping design toward one end to drain automobile fluids. Such a slope just happened to give it ideal acoustical properties as well. Disney was the studio's sole client for its first four years, during which time Sunset saw the recording of the soundtracks for Bambi, Mary Poppins, 101 Dalmatians, and other Disney projects. In 1962, Tutti opened the studio's doors to the public.", 'Sunset\'s echo chambers are austere, strangely angled rooms painted in a glossy, off-white sheen. At the far end of Studio One\'s echo chamber sits a vintage Altec Lansing A7 "Voice of the Theatre" full-range speaker system, which has been used for playback in the chamber for most of its history.', "The Doors were one of Sunset's most high-profile clients in the late '60s. While recording their first two albums, The Doors' producer Paul A. Rothchild was especially fond of the studio's Studio One chamber, often tracking Jim Morrison's vocals through it live. Yet plenty of other rock and pop royalty put the chamber to good use there throughout the '60s and '70s, including The Rolling Stones, Joni Mitchell, and many more. The original Studio One echo chamber is still intact and in use today.", "London's Abbey Road is blessed with three uniquely different echo chambers. The most famous of these is attached to Studio Two. The chamber is a surprisingly small, tiled space accessed via a door under the stairs and equipped with moveable pillars to break up reflections.", 'Naturally, Beatles producer George Martin and engineers Geoff Emerick and Norman "Hurricane" Smith took frequent advantage of the chamber. The track "And I Love Her" heavily featured the effect on the percussion and vocals.', "A similar chamber sits on the roof of Abbey Road, permanently wired up and ready for use. A third chamber, attached to Studio Three, was built in the 1980s and covered (except for the floor) in sharply angled mirrors. The pillared and mirrored rooms have been immortalized in Waves' Abbey Road Chambers convolution reverb plugin, which also models a famous stone room at London's Olympic Studios. The plugin even goes so far as to recreate Abbey Road's proprietary S.T.E.E.D. (Send, Tape, Echo, Echo, Delay) effect, which produces cascading washes of reverb by introducing delay and feedback into the system.", "When EMI acquired Capitol Records in 1955, the music industry giant began construction on a new headquarters in Hollywood. Les Paul, one America's foremost recording experts, was brought in to consult on the design of Capitol's new recording studio. In addition to creating a world-class, acoustically tuned environment for recording and mixing the hits of the day, Paul helped create eight concrete echo chambers, built 30 feet under the building.", "Roughly trapezoidal in shape with no parallel surfaces, each of Capitol's chambers has slightly different dimensions tailored to produce different reverb characteristics and decay times, up to five seconds long. Capitol's echo chambers made headlines in 2008, when a petition was started to prevent the digging phase of a proposed development next to the building, in case it might damage or destroy them.", "The first recording to take place at the new studio was Frank Sinatra Conducts Tone Poems of Color, and over the years countless A-list artists have graced the facility. One such legendary act was The Beach Boys, who recorded their second album, Surfin USA, at Capitol Studios (among other facilities). Surfin USA marks Brian Wilson's first foray into production, when the true Beach Boys sound began to take shape. While instrumental surf bands relied on Fender spring reverbs, the Beach Boys took advantage of Capitol's echo chambers, which enhanced their double-tracked harmonies on the album's title track.", 'Another of Brian Wilson\'s favorite Hollywood haunts, Gold Star Studios, was founded by David S. Gold and Stan Ross in 1950. But it\'s known best for the hits recorded there by legendary producer Phil Spector. Spector became famous for his "Wall of Sound" approach, which relied on dense arrangements and liberal double-tracking to create huge-sounding mixes. Reverb—specifically, the natural reverb from the echo chambers at Gold Star—was the mortar that held the "Wall" together.', 'After a series of experiments including hallway reverb, spring reverb, and a bowl of Jello driven by a transducer, Gold decided the only way to get the perfect sound was to build a proper echo chamber.', 'He constructed two trapezoidal rooms behind Studio A, coating the walls with two full inches of a cement/plaster mixture to increase reflectivity. Ten-watt amps powered 12" speakers in the chambers, and RCA 6203 ribbon mics were used for capture, giving the reverb a thick and warm tone without too much high-end. "Be My Baby" by The Ronettes is a classic Wall of Sound production, featuring percussion drenched in Gold Star\'s famous echo.', "The Wall of Sound's influence was far-reaching: Across the Atlantic, it caught the ear of a young Swedish engineer named Michael Tretow, who ended up working at Metronome Studio in Stockholm. Located in a former cinema, the studio (now called Atlantis Grammofon) has played host to artists as diverse as Quincy Jones, Elvis Costello, Lenny Kravitz, and The Cardigans over the years—though its most famous client was a little pop group called ABBA.", "When Tretow began working with ABBA at Metronome, the stars aligned: The group's larger-than-life pop demanded larger-than-life sound, and Spector's influence crept in. Tretow crafted iconic ABBA recordings by constantly double- and triple-tracking instruments and vocals, making use of varispeed tape techniques, and of course, liberal use of echo chambers.", 'Metronome\'s chambers are larger than most—certainly larger than Gold Star\'s—giving them a fairly long decay time. The effect is especially noticeable on the song "Mamma Mia" from ABBA\'s self-titled album (panned hard left in the stereo mix).', 'Before "The Motown Sound" became a household term, it started from rather humble beginnings. After an unsuccessful venture called The 3-D Record Mart (which sold jazz records and 3-D glasses), music entrepreneur Berry Gordy purchased a house at 2648 West Grand Boulevard in Detroit, Michigan, and set up shop there in 1959, turning the first floor into a studio and living on the second floor. The house would become Motown\'s main base of operations, even as the company bought up six more houses nearby for their administrative and publishing operations.', 'Key to the sound of countless Motown hits was the iconic reverb of Hitsville\'s makeshift echo chamber located in the attic of the house. Hitsville\'s attic chamber was crude and not at all designed with acoustical perfection in mind, but its ambience had a certain character that came to shape the iconic Motown sound. Hitsville\'s echo graced many hits over the years, and it can be heard clearly on the foot-stomps in the intro to "Where Did Our Love Go" by The Supremes.', 'Fun fact: after Hitsville was converted into a museum in 1985, a hole was cut in the ceiling leading to the attic, allowing visitors to hear the famous Motown echo by standing under the hole and clapping their hands or singing.', 'Information about specific echo chambers is scant, and their usage on specific songs even more so.

But how were they justified by the people who designed them, and how did they fare in the marketplace?', 'Here we learn from five electric makers through the years about the inspiration for change and the mixed consequences of going against the grain.', 'In the early \'60s, National in Chicago developed a series of guitars with Res-O-Glas molded hollow fiberglass bodies, which they thought would be more cost effective to make than traditional wooden ones. The new plastic models were the Glenwood, Val-Pro (later Newport), and Studio. The striking body of the Glenwoods and Newports was later nicknamed the "map shape," because it was (rather fancifully) said to resemble an outline of the United States.', 'Models such as the Glenwood 99 and the Newport 88 had a bridge-mounted pickup, as well as two regular pickups, and came with no fewer than seven knobs and a three-way selector.', "National's parent company, Valco, used fiberglass for other brands, too, including Supro and Montgomery Ward's mail-order Airline. There were also guitars with the unusual shapes but with conventional all-wood construction, such as National's Westwood models.", 'Valco boss Al Frost was convinced that plastic guitars were the future.', '"In this age of true scientific progress," he said, "there are better ways to do things. Man-made materials now exist that actually are superior to those of nature alone. Products must work better, be more convenient to use, last longer, and be less subject to wear and damage in the service for which they were designed."', 'It turned out not to be so easy. The bodies had a tendency to develop cracks, and the process was messier and more time consuming than National had imagined. And by 1968, Valco had gone out of business anyway, taken down by an unwise purchase of the ailing Kay company.', 'Dean Zelinsky figured that Gibson was ignoring its heritage, and in 1976 at the age of 19 he set up Dean to make revised and enhanced versions of Gibson classics.', '"You have to think back to where rock was in the late \'70s," he says. "For me, Woodstock in \'69 was the beginning of modern-day rock, and from there it started to get a bit more sophisticated. But while the music was getting progressive, and on stage they were wearing cool clothes and had these great light shows, it seemed funny that people were still playing un-flashy guitars designed in the \'50s."', '"I guess the carpet didn\'t match the cushions, you know? My whole concept," he explains, "was to bring along something sexy and stagey, where the guitar would become part of the look, and to put quality components on the guitar so that people would want to play it."', 'The first three Dean models were the V, Z, and ML. The V and Z were like a Flying V and an Explorer with a figured-wood top, but the ML had a new body design that simply and cleverly combined the two into a star-shaped creation, making it one of the pointiest guitars yet. Players such as Dimebag Darrell popularized the early Deans and helped establish the new brand among metal-leaning players.', 'Later, Zelinsky took a sabbatical away from Dean, returned in 2000, left in 2008 to set up DBZ, and then left there in 2012 to create the Dean Zelinsky brand that he runs today.', "Owner CBS sold Fender in 1985 to an investor group headed by the existing president, Bill Schultz. The historic Fullerton factory was not included in the sale, and this meant American production of Fenders stopped in February '85 while the new team hunted for a new building.", 'They had worked on two radical solidbody designs before the sale by CBS got under way, and both would become victims of the upheaval. The first was the Performer, which in some ways was Fender\'s "Super Strat" competitor, but the other was an even less Fender-like concoction, the Katana. Named for a samurai sword, it looked something like a one-legged Flying V.', "Introduced in 1985 with Fender or Squier brand and necessarily made in Japan like all Fender's guitars at the time, it marked a response to the fashion for unusual body shapes and the pressure from some dealers for Fender to devise its own pointy-body guitar.", "Dan Smith at Fender remembered sitting down with his Mac's art program and messing around.", '"I got to the point where I said yeah, this is as ugly as everybody else\'s," he said. "But the Katana was just too un-Fender for a lot of folks. It was hard for us to take the traditional Fender things and tweak them too far without people throwing up their arms. And in many ways that was our biggest asset and our biggest pain in the ass."', 'Most players resisted the styling and some the imposed Japanese production of the Katana, and like the Performer it lasted just a few years in the line.', "Gibson in the '80s saw Super Strats as a threat and tried to absorb some of the flavors that Jackson, Charvel, and others were successfully dispensing. An early attempt came with the US-1, introduced in 1986, which took the extended-Stratocaster style and gave it a balsa body core. Guitarists found it un-Gibson-like and it did not last long.", "Next, the company added a splash of Super Strat features to a few of its existing models. Gibson mixed humbuckers and single-coils, bolted on locking vibratos, threw in some coil-tap switches, and added angular sets of position markers. The result was the 90 series of 1988, a set of guitars unquestionably of the '80s. They were designed by J.T. Riboloff, who Gibson had hired a year earlier.", '"When I first came to Gibson, Jacksons were what was selling," Riboloff said. "The \'grandpa guitar\' was not cutting it. I designed the whole 90 series—SG, Flying V, Explorer—to bring Gibson into this more modern thing, with a 25 1/2-inch scale, pearl inlays, real binding, and so on. I wanted to put Floyd Rose tremolos on them to begin with, but Gibson had acquired Steinberger, and Ned Steinberger had just developed the KB-X tremolo, so they used that. When they changed to the Floyd, they pulled the binding off the necks and fattened up the necks."', "Gibson discovered again that guitarists wanted Gibsons from Gibson, and not superstrat wannabes. The 90 series lasted only until 1990 in the line, and the company's flirtation with this particular modern style was put to one side.", 'Pete Malinoski began making guitars seriously in 2005 and today runs Malinoski Guitar near Washington D.C. Some of his instruments have been called art guitars, and Pete considers himself to be an artist as well as a guitar maker.', '"I\'m coming from the art end of the world, and there\'s a time when you\'re a novice artist and you copy other people\'s work to get some reps, to get some practice," he says. "But you get to the point where you don\'t copy people\'s paintings any more. Guitar makers, though, are stuck, mostly, just copying somebody else\'s stuff, retracing the same lines. I want to be as far away from that as possible."', "He may have had what he calls his trip to middle of the road with relatively normal models such as the Rodeo and Cosmic. But check out, for example, his Astro Logic. It's a gloriously fanciful concoction that the Jetsons might have played, mixing Velboa fake fur, drum wrap, maple, and Douglas fir. Pete says he intended to ride the line between craft, art, and funk.", '"You want art?" he asks. "I\'ll show you what art is! And you\'re probably not going to like it. Like all good art, it challenges people and confuses them, and they feel dumb, and then they don\'t like it. That\'s kind of the typical reaction. Or it\'s the extreme opposite, the very educated, reverential part, the white gloves and \'don\'t touch it\' thing. For me, though, the next challenge is: What do I do next? I have to keep coming up with another idea. I don\'t know what that is yet."', 'About the Author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

He's looking for an intro to a song The Beatles are developing. As he plays a key on the Mellotron, a small pinchwheel on the key's underside pushes against a motorized rotating rod inside, which starts a length of magnetic tape moving, and at the same time a pad on the key's base pushes the tape against its individual playback head.", "Thanks to the buttons Paul has pushed on the bank of controls above the keys to select Station 1 Track A, out comes a sound something like a grainy flute. He tries an E chord with three keys—G-sharp, B, and E in the bass. Paul chuckles to himself at the atmosphere that's beginning to emerge from this weird instrument. It seems like he has the basis of the song's new intro.", "It's often said today that the Mellotron was a kind of early sampler, and given Paul's experience at Abbey Road, it's not hard to see why. Getting something like the real sound of another instrument from a keyboard was unknown at the time. In fact, the Mellotron, a big, heavy, self-contained machine that could deliver pre-recorded backing rhythms, accompaniments, and lead sounds, was designed to be a sort of high-end entertainment system to rival the Hammond organ.", 'Harry C. Chamberlin first explored the instrumental potential of a tape playback system in the late \'40s and started making his Chamberlin keyboards in California. In the early \'60s, Harry\'s associate Bill Fransen found himself in England, apparently on the hunt for a supplier of playback heads. He fetched up at Bradmatic in Birmingham, a small firm run by three brothers—Leslie, Norman, and Frank Bradley—who, among other things, made tape recorders. Bill gave the Bradleys the impression that the tape-keyboard idea was his—an oversight that later led to a cash settlement with Harry Chamberlin—and soon they formed a company to produce the playback instrument. They decided to call it the Mellotron, the name a mashup of "melody electronics."', "Eric Robinson, a successful British dance band leader, helped finance the new operation along with the celebrity magician David Nixon. (There's a wonderfully cheesy '60s Pathé news film with the pair showing off the instrument's home-entertainment possibilities.) Eric not only put in cash, but also he supervised recordings of the Mellotron master tapes at his IBC studios in London. The recordings the musicians made provided all the sounds required for the Mellotron's reproductions of brass, woodwind, strings, and more.", "The first Mellotron was the Mk1 of 1963, more or less a copy of the Chamberlin, and it was short-lived. An improvement was the Mk2, introduced in 1964 at a mighty £1,000 list price (about $2,800 at the time, something like $22,000 in today's money) and the type hired in by Abbey Road and prodded by Paul.", "It had two 35-note keyboards, G to F, side by side. The left one offered rhythms and phrases from the keys to the left, revealing its home-entertainment origins (Cuban, Viennese Waltz, Bolero, and so on), and to the right were keys for accompaniments such as Church Organ, Swinging Flutes, Blues Beat In F, and more. The right keyboard offered lead or melody instruments, including Paul's Flute as well as Tenor Sax, 3 Violins, Mandolin, and so on.", 'Each of the 70 keys of a Mk2 activated an individual length of magnetic tape, which explains why the Mk2 is sometimes described as 70 tape machines in a box. There were six different sounds or sets along the length of each tape, selectable as Stations, and three different sounds across the tape, selectable as Tracks, providing 18 sounds from each key.', "The Mk2 had a built-in stereo amp and speakers, plus reverb and pitch among the controls. Everything was built into a large wooden case that resulted in a very heavy, Hammond-like piece of furniture. Definitely not a machine you'd want to take on the road.", "In the studio, some rock and pop musicians began to discover the Mellotron's potential to create a particular atmosphere from its taped reproductions of real instruments. Crucially, they also grasped that its sounds were best considered as unique creations rather than faithful imitations.", "Some of the Mellotron's peculiarities added to that uniqueness, including the several-generations quality of the tapes themselves, a distinct tendency to go out of tune, the limit on a note's length to eight or so seconds, and a distinct click often heard at the start of a note as the playback head was engaged. These factors and more made the Mellotron a timely arrival on a pop scene hungry for anything different and unusual. Early adopters included John Lennon, who in 1965 bought a Mk2 for his home music room after seeing it in action at IBC.", 'That same year, 1965, saw some of the earliest pop recordings featuring a Mellotron, made by The Graham Bond Organisation during a July session at Olympic studio in London. Several tracks on Graham\'s album There\'s A Bond Between Us featured some low-key Mellotron in addition to his regular Hammond, including "Baby Can It Be True" and the single "Lease On Love." More striking was the first hit with a Mellotron, Manfred Mann\'s 1966 single "Semi-Detached, Suburban Mr. James," recorded at Philips in London with a distinctive Mellotron flute intro.', 'Other Mellotron models followed the Mk2, including an effects-loaded version used by the BBC and others. In 1968, the single-manual, 52-key M300 appeared, and a few years later there was an improved version of this—the 35-key M400. The 400 was smaller than a Mk2, had simpler controls, no amp nor speaker, and a single set of tape sounds, coming as standard with switchable flute, violins, or cello, although custom sets could be fitted.', "Not surprisingly, the white 400 was the one used on the road by a number of brave rock bands who in the '70s made the Mellotron a key ingredient of the prog recipe. The bands of this era included The Moody Blues, King Crimson, Yes, Tangerine Dream, Barclay James Harvest, and Genesis.", 'Digital sampling, a more efficient and reliable means of re-creating and modifying real instrument sounds, should have killed the Mellotron. And for a while, that seemed to be the case. Knotty business problems meant the British company lost the Mellotron name, although it continued to make the instruments as Novatrons until 1986, and Chamberlin had stopped making their versions around 1981.', 'But the eccentric sound of the Mellotron, a product of its decidedly analogue innards, proved to be resilient. David Kean and Markus Resch kept things going with early offerings of Mellotron and Chamberlin samples, and, as Mellotron Archives, made the MkVI (1999) and MkVII (2003) models, and worked on the preservation of the original tape library for both Mellotron and Chamberlin. The British operation was revived by John Bradley (son of co-founder Les Bradley) and Martin Smith, who in 1993 masterminded a Mellotron tribute CD, The Rime Of The Ancient Sampler. For some musicians, the attractions of the Mellotron had never gone away, but now there was something of a revival, with Radiohead, Oasis, and others featuring those unmistakable sounds.', "These days, you can buy a new instrument from John and Martin at Streetly Electronics, the M4000, or you can seek out an original (and probably need to have it refurbished). You can also find the M4000D digital keyboard, M4000D Mini, or M4000D Rack unit, which lets you play Mellotron's digital collection of tape sounds on your MIDI keyboard of choice.", "You can get an app for a few dollars, or you can check out one of several plugins offering generous swathes of Mellotronical sounds. It's never been easier to make a Mellotron noise.", "Back in 1966, Paul McCartney persevered with the Mk2 in Abbey Road and put a lovely flute-like intro on the front of that new Beatles song, 'Strawberry Fields Forever.' It's survived for more than 50 years as the best Mellotron advertisement of all time.", 'Rick Wakeman played Mellotron on David Bowie\'s "Space Oddity" (and for his trouble was paid a session fee of £9, about $20 at the time) and later with Strawbs, Yes, and his own solo work. He summed up the balance between the charms and the idiosyncrasies of Mellotrons: "I love the unique sounds they produce," he told Frank Samagaio in The Mellotron Book. "But at the same time I\'ve been reduced to tears when they frequently misbehaved whilst out on tour."', "For now, though, I'll finish with my personal top 11 'Tron tracks, in no particular order. I dare say you'll be keen to remind us about the even better ones I've overlooked.", 'Update: After reading Tony Bacon’s take, Streetly Electronics’ Martin Smith wanted to jump in with his favorite Mellotron tracks as well: "This article is nicely clear and concise... and accurate. Hurrah! I have to mention, being a pedant, that The Moodies never used the M400, but apart from that..."

It was 40 years ago, in fact.', "At the time, an impressive array of new keyboard synthesizers were invading stage and studio. Guitar makers, worried that the new synths might actually eclipse guitars as the prime instruments of rock, wanted to retaliate. And for Gibson in the late '70s, retaliation came in the shape of active electronics.", 'The benefits of the system, also known as active circuitry, had been highlighted by the bass specialist Alembic and the pointy specialist B.C. Rich. The idea was to use an onboard battery-powered active preamp to boost the guitar\'s signal and widen its tonal range. Gibson hoped that in the process this might provide some new models with more of an "electronic" sound and modern appeal among the synthesized wails of those increasingly confident keyboard players.', "Gibson's first shot at actives came during 1977 in the Firebird-like shape of the RD series, which had a mix of active preamps plus compression and expansion circuits. The circuits were devised for Gibson by the synth pioneer Bob Moog, whose company Moog Music was owned at the time by Norlin—which also owned Gibson.", '"These instruments become dynamic, rather like a piano," Gibson\'s catalogue for the new RDs suggested, "and the player is able to control the guitar\'s response during fast licks more precisely than ever before." The player also was somewhat baffled by the complexity of these guitars.', "The $699 RD Standard was a regular electric without the active stuff, which was reserved for the $759 RD Custom and $859 RD Artist. Both the Custom and the Artist had an identical looking control layout, with four knobs and two switches alongside a front-mounted jack. Both had two regular volume knobs, one per pickup as you'd expect, but the other two knobs were master tones, which offered active bass and treble, each numbered 0 in the center and then plus or minus 1 to 5 either side.", 'One of the two switches on both models was a regular three-way pickup selector. The other switch on the RD Custom was a two-way that selected between the active mode and a treble-boosting bright–lead mode. On the RD Artist, the second switch (which Gibson called the "trick switch") was a three-way that selected between compression-expansion mode, neutral (active) mode, or bright–lead mode.', 'Compression worked on the front humbucker, and Gibson\'s catalogue said it "reduces fundamental attack and \'compresses\' each note into a long sustaining signal," explaining that this resulted in a stable output regardless of how hard a note was played. Expansion worked on the rear pickup, and Gibson said it allowed the guitarist "to play harder and louder without the note collapsing" which gave "a very fast, explosive response with a rapid decay."', "There were some cosmetic differences between the RD Custom and Artist, too, most obviously a dot-marker maple fingerboard on the Custom where the Artist had a block-marker ebony board. The more expensive Artist also had Gibson's TP6 fine-tuning tailpiece and a fancy winged-f motif on its bound headstock, and these original RDs all had long, Fender-like 25 1/2-inch scale lengths rather than Gibson's regular 24 3/4.", 'The RD models limped into the early \'80s. Many guitarists ignored them. The main objection at the time seemed to be the complex controls and associated sounds of the two active models, especially the Artist, but there was also criticism of their wonky Firebird-Explorer body shape—without much of the charm of those two earlier creations. Bruce Bolen, who was head of Gibson\'s R&D department at the time, told me about a particular objection to the electronics. "Well," he said with a sigh, "you had enough highs there to slice cheese."', "But Gibson decided it wasn't quite finished with active guitars. Maybe someone pointed at the money spent developing the circuitry with Moog, although Gibson seems to have believed that it was mostly the relatively unconventional body styling of the RDs that was to blame for their lack of success. Because in 1979—that's 40 years ago as you read this—Gibson applied the electronics of the RD actives to the much more traditional body designs of a Les Paul solidbody and an ES thinline.", 'The new Artist guitars were the $1,299 Les Paul Artist and the $1,399 ES Artist. (To put that in perspective, at the same time in 1979 a regular Les Paul Standard listed at $799 and an ES-335 at $849.) Both had upscale features, including gold-plated metalwork, TP6 fine-tuning tailpiece, "Crank" fold-out tuner winders, "Sustain Sisters" brass studs to mount the bridge, and "Posi-Lok" strap locks. There was an access panel to the electronics on the rear of the body, with trim-pots and a nine-volt battery inside.', 'The RD-like electronics came in a control layout of three knobs and three mini-switches—the knobs controlled master volume, active bass, and active treble; the two-way switches selected bright-lead on-off, compression-expansion on-off, and active on-off—and there was also a regular three-way pickup toggle. Tim Shaw in the R&D department at Gibson had to redesign the existing large RD Artist circuit board, transferring that circuitry to two boards, although it still meant removing quite a lot of wood from the Les Paul Artist.', 'Like the RD Artist, the Les Paul Artist had a block-marker ebony fingerboard and a fancy inlay on the bound headstock, this time a stylized "LP." The ES Artist was a 335-like thinline semi-hollowbody, but it was without f-holes. It had unusual Gretsch-like offset markers on its bound ebony board and the RD Artist\'s winged-f headstock motif.', "As with the RDs, however, neither of the new active Artist models managed to convince many guitarists of the benefits of active circuitry. Steve Howe was one of the few prominent players seen with the ES Artist, which he first came across when Gibson's artist relations man, Pat Aldworth, brought one along to a gig on a Yes tour in 1980. Attracted by what he described as the model's crystal-clear top end and the immediacy of the single volume control, Steve began to use four Artists on stage with his new band, Asia.", 'The Les Paul Artist hobbled on to 1981, when it was dropped along with most of the remaining RDs, and the ES Artist survived to 1985. (From about 1979, the RD Artist had been offered in two versions: the RD 77, as the original, and the RD 79, with a regular Gibson 24 3/4-inch scale and the functions of the three-way "trick" switch shifted into two two-way switches.)', 'Tim Shaw said that he didn\'t come to appreciate until later that most guitar players were really quite conservative and did not want their Les Pauls and 335s lumbered with what some of them considered to be excess paraphernalia. On reflection, he thought the electronics of these experimental Gibsons all a bit too much: "Somebody once said that with one of those Artists, you were a flick of a switch away from total disaster."', 'About the Author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

Port's The Birth of Loud: Leo Fender, Les Paul, and the Guitar-Pioneering Rivalry That Shaped Rock 'n' Roll, a new book out January 15. Port's book traces the birth of the solidbody electric guitar and features not only Leo and Les, but Paul Bigsby, Merle Travis, Muddy Waters, and other pioneers of the new instrument.", "In 1947, Leo Fender brought Paul Bigsby over to Les Paul's Hollywood home, where they listened to country and western players jam and discussed how a solidbody guitar could combat volume and feedback issues. By the spring of '51, Bigsby had realized the goal with his custom guitar for Merle Travis and Fender had finally gotten the soon-to-be-named Telecaster into a legitimate production run. This is where the following section begins.", 'CALIFORNIA, MICHIGAN, AND PENNSYLVANIA, SUMMER–FALL 1951', "Hunching over his desk at the Radio-Tel offices in Santa Ana, Don Randall watched orders pour in for Fender's new Spanish electric guitar. In March, he reported working three or four nights every week until ten thirty p.m. and still falling behind. Exhausted and thrilled by May, before guitars had even left the factory bearing the new Telecaster name, Randall crowed about the order deluge in letters to his salesmen. Then he pushed them for more.", '"Our Spanish guitar is selling in quantity that surprises even us, but we still aren\'t doing a good job," he told one. Some dealers had ordered the Fender electric so long ago that they were surprised by its arrival, but most moaned about not getting guitars fast enough. At $189.50, plus $39.95 for a hard case, the Telecaster was a relative bargain, and Fender was setting new sales records every month. Randall still thought the company could do better.', "He remembered what it had been like to walk the floors of the trade shows and be laughed at by Fender's larger rivals in the East, to see his firm casually dismissed for even dreaming up a solidbody guitar. There was one thing, he knew, that would shut those naysayers up for good.", "That spring of 1951, there would have been no better endorser for the new Fender guitar than Les Paul, the most popular electric guitarist in the country. Getting a Fender Telecaster in Paul's pop-star hands would virtually guarantee massive sales and acceptance around the country—not just in California and the Southwest, where Fender was already popular.", "It would be a coup, nabbing this famous player from established firms like Gibson and Epiphone, whose instruments he'd always preferred. Don Randall knew that Leo and Les were friendly, and both Don and Leo desperately wanted Les to adopt the Telecaster. So one evening in the middle of June, Randall went to try to make it happen.", '"I was up in Los Angeles Saturday night, and talked to Les Paul," Randall wrote to a colleague on June 21, 1951. "[I] left him a guitar and amplifier to try this week, and he is going to give them a good workout and let me know his opinion. You probably know he has been using one of our Super Amps for a long time. In fact, it looks like he must have had it for a hundred years or more. This week, he is trying a Pro Amp and Telecaster guitar and his comments should be very interesting."', "To Les, Randall gave a translucent blond, two-pickup Telecaster with no name decal, its neck inscribed with the date 5-10-51. Les apparently thought the guitar was a prototype rather than a production model, more or less confirming Randall's impression that he couldn't be bothered to pay too much attention to either the guitar or the man delivering it.", '"This was the first occasion I had to meet Les and to watch him perform in person, and believe me, he is really a fine instrumentalist," Randall wrote. "However, he appears to be somewhat self-centered. Mary Ford is a very gracious person and very talented. She sings beautifully and plays the guitar better than nine-tenths of the people playing today."', 'Self-centered or not, Les Paul mattered enough that Randall eagerly awaited his verdict. Les later recalled that there with the Telecaster was a note from Leo, asking him "to look at [the guitar] and think about it." Here was an instrument that embodied the ideas Les had long championed, a solidbody guitar that showed the way to the future.', "Leo wanted Les's endorsement, but business may not have been his only motive. Leo would've wanted to show his friendly rival what he'd been up to—to brag, just a little, in the quiet, matter-of-fact way he did everything.", "The advances that Les, Leo, and Paul Bigsby had talked about on those afternoons in Les's backyard were reflected neatly and powerfully in the Telecaster. What had been just wild notions, near-hunches, were now a commercial product, modestly priced, practically designed, and available in music stores all around the country. They'd all been working on the same problem, and Leo believed he'd solved it—not just for a few well-heeled professionals, as Bigsby had, but for guitar players everywhere.", '"This is where I\'m going," Leo told Les around this time, as Les recalled. "Would you like to come and be a part of it?" Les thought joining with Fender might be smart. Leo had shown the ability to realize a radical and controversial idea. The Telecaster was now a guitar that regular working musicians could buy, one strikingly different from anything else hanging in a music store. A partnership with Leo "first hit me as a swell idea," Les recalled.', 'Then he started to consider his long, on-and-off relationship with Gibson, whose guitars he\'d loved since childhood. The Fullerton operation, though it had a revolutionary new product, was still tiny. "There was no Fender then," Les told an interviewer—which, while incorrect, suggests the meagerness of Fender\'s national impact. "There was just Leo planning to do this."', "Gibson had turned down Les's idea for the Log a decade earlier, and Les now played mostly Epiphones he'd modified himself, but he still felt a connection with the prestigious Michigan company. Crucially, Les also decided that he didn't really like Leo's Telecaster very much. The sound of it was too bright and sharp for him. The design was too plain, too straightforward, too unlovely. The Fender was a common man's guitar, and Les had always viewed himself as exceptional.", 'When Leo came to ask what Les thought of the instrument, and brought up the possibility of an endorsement, Les had bad news. "I told Leo, \'Geez, you know, I\'ve had a great relationship with Gibson all these years, and it\'s part of the biggest instrument company in the world, and I\'d like to take another shot at doing a guitar with them before I make a move.\'"', 'Les just wasn\'t ready to give up on Gibson, even though Gibson had laughed at his last big idea. In his autobiography, Les claimed that Leo understood this decision. "He was okay with me not wanting to abruptly jump into something new."', "But Les didn't just decline the endorsement. He decided to use Leo's breakthrough in a way that would change their relationship forever. In Les's telling, he tried to wield the Fender solidbody as leverage to get Gibson to make the kind of instrument he wanted. After taking a close look at the Telecaster, Les claims he called Maurice H. Berlin, president of Gibson's parent company, and told him about it.", 'At a subsequent meeting, according to Les, Berlin asked him what he thought of the Telecaster. Les tried to put a bug in the executive\'s ear: "I believe the solidbody guitar is going to be very important," he told Berlin. "And if you don\'t do something, Fender is going to rule the world."', "Excerpted from The Birth of Loud: Leo Fender, Les Paul, and the Guitar-Pioneering Rivalry That Shaped Rock 'n' Roll by Ian S.

He was dressed as he would have been around 1967. "Hey man, why are you buying this equipment of mine?" It was true: I\'d bought a few ex-Hendrix items lately. I told him I was a guitar player and writer, and I thought that the gear would give me some inspiration, because I was a fan of his music and still listened to it regularly.', 'Jimi said, "Let\'s go here for a drink and a talk," and we went into some ancient pub. I think I was drinking beer, and Jimi was on scotch and coke. We talked, but I don\'t recall any of it. At the end we shook hands and Jimi waved me off.', 'This all took place in a dream I had in 1995. I told Noel Redding about it some years later, and he said, "So, he\'s still around then? That\'s nice to hear." Pushed further, Noel said that Jimi had visited him, too, in a dream, in the early \'70s. Noel had said to Jimi, "But you\'re dead!" Jimi replied he was just saying hello, as he\'d come back for somebody. That was just before Hendrix\'s co-manager Mike Jeffrey died in a plane crash in France.', 'A few days after the dream, I happened to be in my local guitar shop in Newcastle upon Tyne. I knew the owner, John, very well. He said, "Hey, I\'ve just got a Jimi Hendrix Flying V!" He showed it to me, and I asked if it really was Jimi\'s. He said no, but it was the same model, and added: "Wouldn\'t it be something if it was actually Jimi\'s guitar?" At this point, in the mid-\'90s, nobody had seen the Jimi guitar, the one with his hand-painted decorations on it, for over 20 years.', 'John\'s guitar had a 1967 serial number, just visible under an all-over thick black re-spray. The nut had been grooved out to take left-handed stringing, and there was a strap button on each point of the "V," also indicating left-handed use. John told me it had come from a guitar collector in Brighton who got it from a left-handed blues player. I went away and consulted some books to find out more.', 'Meanwhile, John told me he\'d discovered the name "Ken Hensley" (of Uriah Heep) stencilled on the aftermarket case, and that he\'d contacted Ken to try to sell him his old guitar. Time for action. I made an offer for the guitar along with a nice Gretsch hanging in the shop, and took both home. I figured even if the V wasn\'t Jimi\'s, it was still worth having. And it was a matter of weeks after that dream where Jimi approved of me using his gear, so it felt comfortable. People laughed, but now I had a Flying V that might have been Jimi\'s.', 'In that pre-digital world, I took photos to send to people, looking for evidence or validation. I learned that Gibson made 111 Vs in 1967—67 of which were in cherry finish—leaving 44 in sunburst or "sparkling burgundy." This one had never been cherry: I could see traces of brown lacquer where the black paint hadn\'t covered. The pickguard, tuners, and wiring seemed original (the pots dated to \'66). I was left with a load of black paint to look at, covering what might be underneath. Stumped.', "I took a fresh look at Mitch Mitchell's book, The Hendrix Experience, comparing its photos of Jimi with the V to those I'd taken of my guitar, looking for any discrepancies that would indicate two different guitars. I couldn't find any. Both had the same tuners, the same hardware—everything. But Jimi's had been hand-painted over a dark finish, which I thought was black, because it looked black on photos. And mine was black, but re-done.", 'Then I noticed in a picture of Jimi with the guitar that one of the plastic pearloid inlays had caught the camera\'s flash and reflected it. One of my photos had the same reflection in the same place. I got the guitar out, and I realised that the inlays were all randomly formed, each with "inclusions" that reflected light in different directions and with random swirls on the plastic, all unique.', "The cover of Charles Shaar Murray's Crosstown Traffic book had a colour picture of Jimi that showed the patterns in the pearloid inlays very clearly. It was a match, exact in every way, impossible to copy or fake in 3D plastic. So, I had these inlays in an early-'67 Gibson Flying V. All in the correct location, all in the same aspect. In a rare guitar that had been played left-handed and refinished. And one of 44 made that entire year. Hmm.", "I took the guitar to Stephen Maycock at a Sotheby's valuation day in Newcastle. As I took the pickguard off to show him inside, he said he was sure that it was Jimi Hendrix's guitar. I asked what give him that idea, before even holding it? He pointed at some coloured paint traces on the underside of the pickguard, created when Jimi had painted the guitar in '67 and the paint ran under the guard while it was still wet.", "I contacted everyone I could for more info. Mitch Mitchell called me one day and said the V had a sunburst finish before Jimi painted it. Dark brown. I said I thought it was black, but he insisted: He'd worked in Jim Marshall's music shop, dealing with guitars, and knew sunburst when he saw it. That was a definite. I asked Jimi's old manager, Chas Chandler, who remembered Jimi buying the V and painting it with model-kit hobby paints in mid '67.", 'I found a video where you could see wood grain in the body through the finish, even though it was a dark brown sunburst, rather like a period Firebird. I had the guitar restorer Clive Brown carefully remove the black finish, and I was amazed to see traces of the psychedelic paint job between the wood and the new black paint. Also a bash in the headstock face, which is shown happening in a Paris studio as Jimi whacks a cymbal with the guitar before miming to "Hey Joe" on French TV. Clive applied a dark brown translucent nitro finish, and the guitar looked like it might have done when brand new.', "Using a blown-up photo I purchased from Jean-Pierre Leloir, the photographer who had perfectly captured Jimi with the guitar in '67, I re-created the psychedelic paint job on an acetate sheet. I applied that to the new finish, rather than paint it directly on to the body and have someone in the future assume it was original work.", "In 1995, I went with Stephen Maycock's advice to offer the guitar at auction. Its value was becoming a worry, although I had safely gigged it and recorded it, for example on Prefab Sprout's Andromeda Heights album and my trip-hop album Slingshot. The auction was underwhelming and the guitar did not sell, possibly due to Experience Hendrix L.L.C.'s request for the return of all items once belonging to Jimi. Sotheby's legal department told them that Jimi gave the guitar away in 1969 to Mick Cox (who'd just left Eire Apparent), and ownership was confirmed as being in my hands legally, as the guitar had never been lost or stolen. (I found out Mick played the guitar until 1973, when he was short of cash and had to sell it. That's when he removed the psychedelic paintwork and painted it black, to hide the fact he was selling Jimi's guitar—which, I can understand, might have felt awkward back then.)", 'In 2003, I sold the Jimi V to a respected San Diego-based dealer and collector, who had a client for it. I carried it in the tatty old case through London until I reached a secret Mayfair address. As I entered the double security door I was faced with an armoured glass window with a hatch underneath. I was told to place the guitar in the hatch. It was retrieved from the other side, the hatch clicked shut, and I was told that business was concluded. No cup of tea, then. And off it went to its new owner, very discreetly.', "A few years later, I had a call from Edwin Wilson, at Gibson's Custom Shop, who had seen pictures of my restoration work. He asked if I'd be able to paint several hundred identical reissue guitars for their Inspired By series. I politely declined, unable to do this mammoth task in under a year. Bruce Kunkel did, though. I supplied my re-created design, some patterns, instructions, and photos on a guitar Gibson sent me. In 2006, 300 exact replicas appeared.", "Gibson sent me the first finished prototype Inspired By Jimi Hendrix model, and I have to say it was perfect in the paintwork. Their numbered certificate shows an artist's studio setup with paints, a V, and a pine table. That is actually my own kitchen table, and that's me painting the first design pattern to send to Gibson! The only differences were that the Inspired By guitar had a neck-joint tenon too long compared to the Jimi guitar, and the pickups were too hot. But it appealed to a modern player for all that, and Gibson did a super job on it.", 'That prototype still hangs on my wall as a reminder of the years I owned the real thing. Maybe it was the best guitar in the world, and certainly the best I could ever own, thanks to Jimi hooking me up with it. And it did enhance my music, and my view of writing and performance. So, job well done, Jimi. I keep the Freak Flag flying high here.', "About the author: David Brewis is a musician and producer (The Kane Gang, Prefab Sprout) who has been involved in Hendrix collecting since he bought a Gibson J-200 from Jimi's manager Chas Chandler in the mid-'80s.

Despite some fans that still love the S612 to this day, many of those samplers have been plundered for parts or left to electronics recycling bins over the years. But while it was a very simple machine compared to those that followed, its basic functions set the stage for the line of rackmount samplers that would help bring sample-based music-making into the modern age.", 'With the S612, users could record a small snippet of sound from an instrument or vocal (up to 8 seconds), using a MIDI keyboard controller to set the sample rate. (You could choose between 4kHz and 32kHz, a range that would be expanded in future samplers.) At lower rates, you could fit more samples onto the limited memory. And you could then save your samples onto disks, the format of which would also change as the samplers progressed, from 2.8" quick disks to standard floppy disks to hard disks in later years. (And original sample floppy disks are still sought-after today.)', 'Once you sampled a sound, you could play it across the notes of your MIDI controller and then use the Akai’s on-board controls to edit where the sample starts and stops, reverse it, adjust filter parameters, and choose whether the sound plays in a loop or just one time with each press of a key. The combination of low bit depth and low sampling rates would introduce new timbres to your sampled sounds. A rich synth could turn reedy and gauzy, a bass could become thicker, and a kick could gain added crunch.', 'Akai’s digital MIDI samplers helped bring the art of sampling to a much wider range of musicians than expensive units like the Synclavier and Fairlight CMI. When used in conjunction with Akai’s MPC drum machines/sequencers or an E-Mu Sp-1200, the S series greatly extended the range of producers. And the use of S series samplers along with early Commodore 64 and Atari ST computer sequencers helped pave the way for the future of computer music.', 'The S series samplers were famously fundamental to electronica, jungle, drum and bass, and other forms of dance music. But artists as diverse as My Bloody Valentine, The Bomb Squad, and Jean-Michel Jarre are all known to have employed S series units on their records.', "From '85 to the present day, sampling has of course only grown in prominence, and the process is far easier than in previous eras, thanks to developments in music software and any number of newer, more portable hardware units like the Elektron Octatrack and Digitakt, MPC Live, and Korg Electribe 2 Sampler. But plenty of producers still want the original sounds and feel of the Akai S Series.", "Because of the diversity of today's sampler options, you can find these vintage S series machines for relatively cheap (and certainly far cheaper than they were new). Below, we're looking at some of the major models.", "Much more so than the S612, the S900 helped to bring professional-level sampling quality to the masses, with 15,000 of these 12-bit sampling units being manufactured between '86 and '88. They have a built-in floppy disk drive and feature eight-voice polyphony, with each of these voices having its own separate output, letting users record and process individual hits with ease. But it was the S950 and its time-stretching capabilities—along with a higher possible sampling rate (up to 48kHz from the S900's 40kHz) and increased memory—that expanded the possibilities of hardware samplers.", 'As Norman Cook, aka Fatboy Slim, said in a 2017 Sound On Sound article, "The S900 was fairly rudimentary. The S950 you could and still can do pretty much anything you want." If you want the sonic character of the S950 without the hassle of the hardware unit, you can even software emulations like the RX950.', 'The S700 is aberrant in a few ways. Introduced at the same time as the S900, it was actually a module version of Akai’s keyboard-based X7000 sampler. Both the X7000 and S700 were modeled after the S612, and as such, is a 12-bit sampler with the same filter and effects, though they included some advancements in editing functions. Although the quick disk drive was included in the S700 (as opposed to having to buy the S612’s companion drive, the MD280), most of these drives no longer work in existing units. Importantly, it swapped the S612’s bevy of faders and knobs for a menu-based workflow.', "The S1000 was actually released at the same time as the S950, but included many more features. Whereas the S950 still had 12-bit processing (despite its advanced editing tools), the S1000 was a premium, 16-bit sampler that was still relatively affordable upon its release—and had all of the S950's editing tools and more. Importantly, it could record your samples in stereo, whereas all previous S series samplers were limited to mono.", 'In 2011, while auctioning off some of his equipment, Depeche Mode\'s Alan Wilder said: "In particular, many of the famous \'Violator\' and \'SOFAD\' drums were sampled using the Akai [S1000], which was particularly good at stacking and triggering sounds tightly (much better than the Emulators, which took a back seat around this time). We would often trigger four or five snares at once for example, with different envelope shapes and filtering on each to make a composite big sound. ... I remember, during those recording sessions, us having several Akai machines all running simultaneously, with many sounds and loops emanating from each before we committed anything to tape so that we could continually update the sound picture as we built the songs."', 'With the S900 and S1000, Akai successfully took the mantle as the industry leader in sampling tech. The S1000 was being used in professional studios across the world, so in 1990, Akai released the S1100, which included many updates aimed at professional engineers and producers. The new machine included a SMPTE reader and generator to sync up with visual editing, improved D/A converters to get a better signal-to-noise ratio, and enough memory to hold more than 12 minutes of audio (in mono, at the lowest sampling rate)—quite the feat at the time. The professional features came with a premium price upon its release though.', 'In 1992, Akai released its new flagship model, the S3000, along with the S2800 (a cheaper, slightly downgraded model of the S3000). Counting it as its third generation of samplers, the S3000 took the earlier 16-voice polyphony of the line and doubled it to 32 voices. The SMPTE reader and hard-disk recording option from the S1100 were included as optional features on the S3000, though were not available for the S2800. They were prized for their onboard filters, envelopes, and digital effects.', 'With many different storage options competing in the technological boom at the time, these units offered a mix of floppy disk, hard disk, removable cartridges, magneto-optical disks, and CD-ROM options. The S3000XL, released in 1996, made previously optional features like the hard-disk and SMPTE reader standard, while the S3200 made the previously option digital filter expansion board and MO disk drive standard. The S3200XL came with a software program to integrate with a Mac-based sequencer.', "The S2000 continues to be a favorite for producers working with S series samplers today—so it's harder to come by on the used market. As the naming conventions of the S line don't quite match up to chronological release dates, the S2000 was actually released years after the S3000 and S2800. With the S2000, you can choose to record at 16-bit or 8-bit resolutions, 22kHz to 44.1kHz sample rates, and in stereo or mono. With 32-voice polyphony and memory expandable up the 32MB, the S2000 was a powerful, entry-level alternative to the S3000 upon its release, and is still much sought-after today.", 'The S5000 and S6000, released at the very end of the 1990s, represented the end of an era of hardware samplers. Radically redesigned from their predecessors, the units were powerful machines with interfaces more closely resembling a computer than a simple back-lit display. They could handle up to 256Mb of RAM and could hold more than 25 minutes of samples in stereo at the highest sampling rate.', 'The S6000 came standard with 128-voice polyphony, while the lesser model, the S5000, came with 64-voice polyphony standard but was upgradable to 128 as well. While more powerful than ever, the S series were about to be eclipsed by the power of DAWs. As such, these later-year samplers are now no longer as prized as the earlier models like the S1000—which, though they make lack in features, are still loved for the special character they impart on their samples.', 'Will Sacks contributed reporting to this article.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

The Country Gent was the high-end guitar, while the Tennessean, a sort of less fancy one-humbucker take on the 6120, was the budget option. The Tennessean had a list price of $295 USD, the 6120 continued to sell for $400, and the Gentleman was pitched at $525. That put the new Country Gent second only to the White Falcon in the company's hollowbody electric line.", 'Chet himself switched from a 6120 to the new Country Gentleman as his main studio guitar. Despite the "improved" versions of the Gent that came later —notably the double-cutaway version introduced in 1961—and the fact that Gretsch would send them to him as they appeared, Chet continued to play his single-cut original. He felt it was a better instrument, and his view was that most of the changes Gretsch made were for the sake of change.', 'Chet helped promote the new Gent, and in summer 1957 Gretsch announced to its dealer network that "guitar star Chet Atkins will be in the Gretsch Guitar room to greet you personally" at that year\'s NAMM show in Chicago, where the Country Gent was previewed to the music trade, ready for its launch in \'58.', '1. The Country Gentleman was designed to avoid feedback.', "Gretsch had for some time been concerned about feedback from its hollowbody models. Guitarists now playing live rock'n'roll at high levels on this type of electric were sometimes troubled by howling feedback when they pumped up the volume. Ray Butts suggested a solution, telling Gretsch that the way to minimize feedback—and to get better sustain into the bargain—was to secure the body's top in order to stop it vibrating.", 'Gretsch followed his advice and installed what it called truss bracing, which has since become better known as trestle bracing. The company was already gluing to the underneath of hollowbody tops a parallel pair of wooden rails to secure the pickups. Now, it began to add a "trestle," a sort of wide bridge-shape wooden section, to each of the rails. The two "legs" of each trestle connected to the back of the body, which meant the pair of trestles provided four curved, solid vertical posts that joined the top to the back. The result was a guitar where the top and back vibrated more sympathetically with each other, helping to cut feedback and enhance sustain.', 'Gretsch originally used its new trestle bracing from around 1958 to 1962 on many of its hollowbody models, including the Country Gent, the 6120, and the Tennessean, as well as the Country Club and the White Falcon. The company had for some time been making its "solidbody" models, such as the Duo Jet, with various pockets routed into the body, and for Gretsch this new bracing system further blurred the lines between solidbody and hollowbody guitars.', "2. The Country Gent's new Filter'Tron pickups needed a new control layout.", 'By 1958, Gretsch was advertising its new humbucking Filter\'Tron pickups as standard on almost all its models, including the new Country Gent. It proudly claimed that the Filter\'Trons "eliminate absolutely all electronic hum—you get pure guitar sound."', "Ray Butts, who devised the Filter'Trons, revised Gretsch's regular control layout to complement the new humbuckers. Until now, a Gretsch with two single-coil DynaSonic pickups had three knobs down beyond the bridge (a volume per pickup and a master tone), a master volume on the cutaway bout, and a pickup selector switch (bridge–both–neck) on the top bout.", 'Now, a two-humbucker Gretsch such as the Gent came with two volume knobs, one for each pickup, down beyond the bridge, and the regular master volume knob near the cutaway. On the top bout, there were now two three-way selector switches. The one furthest from the player was the usual bridge–both–neck pickup selector, but the other one replaced the old tone knob and was for "tone color." It selected between bass-emphasis, neutral, or treble-emphasis settings. Some Gretsch vintage fans call this the mud switch, thanks to what they consider its less-than-useful sounds, and many keep it safely stuck in the neutral middle position.', '3. The Gent was the first Gretsch with a thinline body.', 'The new single-cutaway Country Gentleman had a thinline body, a style that Gibson had popularized with its Byrdland and ES-350T models, both of which the Kalamazoo-based company had introduced in 1955.', 'Gretsch\'s take on Gibson\'s idea was an important feature of the new Gent, which had a body around 2" deep. This was in contrast to most of the similar models in the company\'s contemporary catalogue that were around an inch deeper—the 6120, for example, was about 2 3/4" deep at the time.', 'The Gent was also the first of the Chet Atkins models that Gretsch offered with a slightly wider 17" body—just like the White Falcon, Country Club, and Convertible—while the 6120 was only 15 1/2" wide, as was the new Chet Tennessean.', 'The body of the Country Gentleman was finished in semi-transparent brown, which Gretsch called a "rich mahogany-grained country-style finish." The company gave the Gent its customary four-figure reference number that denoted a specific combination of model and color, in this case 6122. The only Gretsch generally known today by its reference number is the 6120, no doubt because its full name—the Gretsch Chet Atkins Hollow Body 6120—is something of a mouthful.', "4. Gretsch's new Country Gent had fake f-holes.", 'A key element of the new Country Gentleman was its sealed body with "fake" f-holes, a further design feature intended to reduce the chance of feedback. In fact, Gretsch had been looking at this idea for a number of years, and it went back to an experimental 6120 that the New York-based company had made for Chet around 1956.', "The instrument can be seen in some detail on the front of the sleeve of Chet's Finger-Style Guitar album of that year. This testbed 6120 had a thick, solid top with painted-on f-holes and it was fitted with prototype Butts humbuckers feeding two output jacks.", 'Much later, Gretsch would reproduce the historic instrument, calling it the Chet Atkins Stereo Guitar 6120-CGP and offering it as a limited edition in 2008.', '5. The Gent was one of the first Gretsch guitars with thumbnail markers.', 'During the earlier days of Gretsch electrics, the company used traditional dot-shape or block-shape position markers on its fingerboards as well as a more ornamental type of block marker known as the hump-top. During 1957 and into 1958, however, Gretsch introduced a new shape for its fingerboard inlays, usually known as thumbnail or half-moon markers.', 'Gretsch was never shy about using a fancy term for its hardware and features where other companies might use a plain one. So it was that Gretsch rather grandly called its new look the Neo-Classic fingerboard. A leaflet promoting the change described the "beautifully inlaid mother-of-pearl half moons on the bass side of the board," which it said were "perfect position markers and do not in any way detract from the classic feel which is so essential to perfect performance."', "At the same time as the new thumbnail markers appeared along the side of many Gretsch fingerboards, including the new Country Gentleman, many of the boards were switched from rosewood to ebony to enhance Gretsch's distinctive Neo-Classic look.", 'An original-style single-cut Country Gent is still available today, as the G6122T-59 Vintage Select Edition, 60 years after its first appearance in the Gretsch line, where it was promoted as the "new hollowbody guitar with all the famous Chet Atkins features." This refined Gentleman has certainly stood the test of time.', 'About the Author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

Read the rest of the series here:', "Many of the first guitar effects of the '30s, '40s and '50s were large, clumsy, electro-mechanical devices designed to reproduce sounds that occurred in nature, such as the echo or reverberation of a large, reflective performance space. Given the available tech, the only way to re-create such sonic effects was to literally delay or reverberate the sound, by recording it on a tape or wire that was played back a fraction of a second behind the original signal, or sending it down a coiled spring that added a lush, wobbly effect when blended back in.", "As the late '60s rolled toward the early '70s, though, major improvements in transistor technology enabled entirely electronic—and far more compact—re-creations of desired sound effects, and the industry exploded as a result. This next installment in our series of historical looks at first effects digs into four debutante sounds enabled by the transistor revolution and the related boom in more compact electronic components: the phase shifter, compressor, envelope filter, and overdrive pedals.", 'Arguably the distinctive sound of the phase shifter, or phaser for short, arrived in the form of a pedal that did not carry that label, some three years before the unveiling of any unit that did. The Uni-Vibe was designed by Fumio Mieda of Japanese manufacturer Shin-Ei around 1968 for the Univox brand, and sold under the umbrella of New York merchandisers Merson Musical Products. It was intended as a solid-state representation of the Leslie rotating-speaker sound (for use with keyboards as well as guitars), but the circuitry that achieved it was indeed a four-stage analog phaser employing photo-electric cells.', 'If we want to pin this "first" on the first pedal to wear the name, however, let\'s look to the Maestro PS-1 Phase Shifter, released in 1971 (which became much more widely available in the PS-1A production model). The PS-1 was housed in a rectangular bent-steel box with brightly colored switches for Slow, Medium, and Fast speeds, but it still was not a "stompbox" as such—there was no footswitch on its top, and it was intended as a "desktop" (or "keyboard top") unit, operated by hand. There was, however, a connector on the back face of the unit to which a three-button floor switch could be attached.', 'Designed by legendary synthesizer maker Tom Oberheim, the PS-1 is a superb sounding unit based on a six-stage phaser using field effect transistors (FETs) to tune its filters. Unlike most phasers that would follow, switching between speeds induced the PS-1 to ramp up or ramp down gradually, just like the Leslie it was intended to mimic, producing an evocative effect, which remains a major part of its appeal.', 'It\'s worth noting that this joined an impressive number of "firsts" (or at least "most significants") in the effects department for Maestro, the electronics brand that stood alongside Gibson under the big Chicago Musical Instruments (CMI) umbrella. Back in \'59 Maestro had revolutionized portable echo with the Echoplex, and had released the first commercial fuzz pedal, the Fuzz-Tone, in \'64.', "Thanks to the PS-1, phase shifting became a major guitar effect to chase in the early '70s, and the use of Maestro's groundbreaker by both Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin, and Alex Lifeson of Rush, among many other major stars, secured the effect's must-have status.", "The genre was made more compact and more convenient by MXR's Phase 90 in 1974. Housed in a conventional pedal with built-in footswitch, its lush sound is heard slathered all over the Rolling Stones' Some Girls album, and on several tracks on the Clash's London Calling album. Around the same time, Electro-Harmonix unveiled its compact Small Stone Phase Shifter with one knob, one slide switch, and a footswitch, and soon every manufacturer worth its salt was putting out its own phaser.", "Compressors were originally designed for use in recording studios, where they're indispensable for smoothing out the dynamics of individual tracks or mixes as a whole. As such, the original intention was more utilitarian than sonic-enhancement, but engineers and musicians alike soon discovered that certain compressors could also add desirable artifacts to the signal passing through them—sustain, shimmer, warmth, body—and guitarists inevitably wanted to take that sound with them to the stage.", 'Likely most people\'s first reference point for compressor used on guitar comes from Roger McGuinn\'s work on the Rickenbacker electric 12-string with The Byrds in the mid-\'60s, as heard in the swirling jangle of the 1965 hit "Mr. Tambourine Man" and several other hits. McGuinn\'s sound was achieved, however, recording straight to the board using a studio compressor, rather than by playing through a compressor pedal as we understand them today—which didn\'t yet exist, in any case.', "For several years guitarists sought a means of achieving that sound on stage, often resorting to studio rack units out of necessity. Then, in 1972, MXR released the Dyna Comp, a compact red pedal that reduced the size of the average compressor by a factor of about 20, while also greatly simplifying the user interface. In place of the studio compressor's confusing controls for functions such as Ratio, Threshold, Attack, Release, and others, the Dyna Comp presented simply Sensitivity (amount of compression) and Output, with a footswitch.", 'These knobs governed a clever circuit that included buffered input and output stages sandwiching a simple but effective transistorized operational transconductance amplifier (OTA), which imparted a soft, rich, juicy tone to the guitar signal in addition to the swell, sustain, and intended compression of the effect. In addition to all this tone, an old Dyna Comp usually kicks out some noise, too, but that\'s in the nature of most compressor pedals (since they kind of "inhale" and then expand the quiet passages between notes, which is where you hear the noise anyway), and many players are willing to live with it.', "Every pedal maker and his cousin soon had their own compressor on the market. Better respected, and more enduring, among the throng are the Dan Armstrong Orange Squeezer that came out a few years after the Dyna Comp (made by Musitronics in the USA, others in Europe), and the gray Ross Compressor released around '79. The Orange Squeezer is famed for its use by Mark Knopfler on early Dire Straits recordings as well as by both Jeff Baxter and Jay Graydon on Steely Dan tracks. The Ross Compressor, much copied today due to astronomical prices of originals, is best known for its use by Trey Anastasio of Phish.", 'Hold on tight—it just got a whole lot funkier. If there\'d been no adequate technical moniker for the envelope filter (aka envelope follower), the term "funk pedal" likely would have done just fine, given these things put the instant Dr. Funkenstein treatment on just about anything they touch. That being said, the classic envelope filter pedal was also used by jazz guitarist Larry Coryell, godfather of jam Jerry Garcia, and the always explorative Frank Zappa, so they\'re more versatile than that might imply. Still, when heard beneath the feet of bassist Bootsy Collins, for example, that\'s where these things are arguably most at home.', 'The first commercial envelope filter of note was the Mu-Tron III, invented by Mike Beigel and manufactured by Musitronics in 1972. If you\'re not sure whether you\'ve heard this thing before, you have: the most prominent early example came courtesy of Stevie Wonder\'s hit "Higher Ground", on the 1973 album Innervisions, for which he tracked several interwoven parts playing his Hohner Clavinet through a Mu-Tron III. Pretty soon, though, the Mu-Tron III was all over the place.', 'The term "envelope filter" refers to the way these circuits function to elicit a kind of frequency-determined "wah" sound as you play the instrument. The effect is induced when an envelope follower at the front-end of the circuit triggers a signal at a strength determined by the strength of the signal played into it. (In other words, it\'s a combination of the setting of the sensitivity control and how hard you pick the guitar or bass string, or hit the keys.) The trigger signal in turn opens a filter after it that peaks either gently or dramatically at a given frequency, producing the distinctive sonic effect. In even simpler terms: the harder you play, the more of that juicy wah sound you induce.', 'The popularity of the sound inspired DOD, Electro-Harmonix, MXR, and several other makers to develop their own envelope filters, although purists will argue that none sounds quite like the original Mu-Tron III. Other envelope filters have also sometimes been labeled "auto wahs," although that name has also been given to some later effects that were quite different from envelope filters, properly speaking.', 'Ubiquitous as they are today, humble overdrive pedals actually arrived relatively late in the realm of "things that make your amp sound more distorted." Conversely, the most extreme effects from that genus—fuzz boxes—hit the ground a full decade before overdrives came along. But while both are intended, in simple terms, to add distortion to your guitar signal, they clearly do things quite differently, the fuzz box slapping on maximum hair for an extreme effect, while the overdrive generally seeks to make you sound like you\'re playing through a slightly more overdriven amp.', 'If we agree with many players in determining that the MXR Distortion +, released in 1973, is really more of an overdrive than a distortion per se, then we can cite this as the first notable entrant in this category. On one hand, the compact, yellow, two-knob unit certainly sounds less extreme than later pedals that would be labeled "distortion" versus those labeled "overdrive"—producing a mildly fuzzy clipping induced by germanium diodes—but perhaps words do matter, too.', 'If we\'re going with the labels, then, the Maxon OD-880 OverDrive Soft Distortion of 1974, made in Japan by Nisshin, arguably takes the biscuit. Not only did it carry that crucial moniker (alongside, yeah, "soft" distortion), but it achieved a more direct example of what we have come to consider overdrive to be: a gently distorted simulacrum of the breakup of a semi-overdriven tube amp, which in fact sounds its best when plugged into a genuine tube amp that\'s just on the edge of breakup itself (or, in some cases, a little ways past it).', "The Maxon OD-880 also deserves a nod for being the precursor to the most esteemed line of overdrive pedals ever created, the Tube Screamers, et al. These started their run as Maxon's own OD-808 before morphing into the better-known Ibanez housings, and evolving into the iconic green Ibanez TS9 and TS10 Tube Screamers, and eventually the several contemporary reissues badged with both the Ibanez and Maxon brands.", 'Examples of "that sound" are all over the place, and although we don\'t have numbers to back it up, Tube Screamers of one guise or another have likely appeared on the boards of more name artists than any other single model of pedal. Oft-cited is Stevie Ray Vaughan\'s use of a Tube Screamer to help induce his fat, singing blues tone, and although he purportedly started with a TS-808 it has been credibly noted that he also simply moved on with whatever was conveniently available, stepping up to the TS9 and TS10 models as they came out.', "Find the rest of the series below.

Fifty years ago they played the last two shows of their farewell tour, at London's Albert Hall on November 26, 1968. Eric Clapton played a Firebird I and a 335. He'd been playing the Firebird for a little over six months, but what about the 335? Thereby hangs a tortuous detective tale.", 'This 1964 block-marker cherry Gibson ES-335TDC—we\'ll call it the Albert Hall 335—would end up selling at one of Eric\'s Crossroads guitar auctions for an eye-watering $847,500. In the 2004 Christie\'s catalogue, he said: "This is the second electric guitar I bought. I had a pinky red Telecaster, and then this. … I bought this brand new, either from Denmark Street or Charing Cross Road. … I went and bought [this] guitar [as soon as I saw it] with the first money I managed to save up [by] playing with The Yardbirds. … I\'ve had it ever since."', "This had become the accepted story: Eric got the Albert Hall 335 during his time in The Yardbirds, didn't use it for years, and then dug it out again for the Albert Hall.", "When I wrote my book about 335s in 2016, I remembered something Jerry Donahue had told me. Years before Jerry came to prominence with Fairport Convention, Joan Armatrading, The Hellecasters, and more, he'd worked as a sales clerk at the Selmer shop in London. He'd told me he sold Eric a 335 just before the Albert Hall shows, and I'd figured he must be mistaken. Now I checked back with him.", '"My memories going back that far can often be a little inaccurate," Jerry admitted, "where just another day in the life is considered, but this was a huge moment for me, and my memory here is razor sharp. It was one of my main highlights of working at Selmer\'s. We had a nice conversation during the process, and just as we were wrapping it up, Eric mentioned the upcoming shows, in a manner that felt as though he was about to offer me a complimentary ticket or two. But I told him I\'d already bought tickets, and he seemed pleased. You can imagine my amazement and joy later as I sat watching Cream come on to the Albert Hall stage, Eric with the 335 I\'d sold him strapped on. He played that guitar for the entire evening. I was filled with pride."', 'If that were true, where did it leave Eric\'s Yardbirds story? Eric joined that band late in 1963. The rhythm guitarist, Chris Dreja, usually played a block-marker cherry 335, while Eric usually played that "pinky red" Telecaster. Occasionally, Eric would pick up the 335 and Chris would switch to another guitar (in the early days a Harmony). Perhaps Eric was mistaken about the Yardbirds 335 and the Albert Hall 335 being one and the same guitar? After all, a lot had happened to him between 1964 and 2004.', 'I checked the serial number of the Albert Hall 335 with Gibson\'s records, which revealed the guitar was shipped on May 20, 1964. But Chris was playing the Yardbirds block 335 well before that. There was a widely reported publicity stunt in May \'64 where The Yardbirds played in the garden of Lord Ted Willis, who\'d spoken that month in the House of Lords about "the problem of young people and leisure" and, on the subject of pop music, said: "This is a cult—a cheap, plastic, candyfloss substitute for culture." The Yardbirds\' publicity guy spotted an opportunity, and the newspapers took the bait. Pictures of the garden event on May 17 show Chris playing his block-marker 335. The Albert Hall 335 wouldn\'t leave the Gibson factory across the ocean for another three days.', 'Then I listened to a Yardbirds gig from \'64 on a CD called Live! Blueswailing recorded at the Marquee on August 7 (or possibly July 31). Singer Keith Relf tells a story between songs about a speaker falling on the 335 which "broke Chris\'s guitar clean in two." More work poring over pictures told me the band immediately replaced the smashed 335 with a Jazzmaster, and then a little later, probably in December \'64 or January \'65, with a dot-neck 335. A few months later, Eric left the band for John Mayall and Chris continued to play this dot 335.', "It all underlined that the Yardbirds block 335 couldn't be the Albert Hall 335. Not only was Chris playing the Yardbirds guitar before the Albert Hall guitar left the Gibson factory, but the Yardbirds instrument was smashed in an accident and replaced. These are two different guitars, and that's how I summed up the story in my 335 book.", 'More recently, however, some pictures have surfaced that seem to throw a truss-rod wrench in the works. The photographer John Peden shot a color roll at one of the gigs Cream played at the Fillmore in San Francisco in August \'67. One frame shows Eric on stage playing his go-to guitar of the period, the psychedelic-painted "Fool" SG Standard. Just visible in one corner is a partial side-view of a guitar sitting out of the way on a stand. It looks like an ES-335 (or a 345 or 355). A couple of blurred frames show the roadie exchanging the ES for the SG with Eric. Frustratingly, there is no shot that clearly reveals which of the ES models it is.', 'John recalls going early to the gig. "The room was empty, so I set my tripod right at the front lip of the stage. Cream were in full Summer Of Love regalia, Clapton with the Afro perm, snakeskin boots, white bellbottoms, the Fool SG, and the red 335, in front of two double Marshall stacks. When they started to perform, they absolutely captured the audience, who had not witnessed such fierce virtuosity. This tight wall of sound was spellbinding! Clapton played both the Fool and the red 335 about equally."', 'The Butterfield Blues Band were on the Fillmore bill, so perhaps Eric borrowed the cherry 345 that Butterfield guitarist Elvin Bishop played? I asked Elvin about those gigs. "I remember no such thing as swapping guitars. What I do remember is sitting at a table upstairs in the Fillmore with Eric, B.B. King, and a totally incoherent acid casualty. Picture an Okie, an Englishman, and a blathering hippie, with B.B. sort of moderating the conversation and somehow making sense of the whole thing. I thought to myself, \'If the Martians ever land, we should send B.B. to talk to them.\'"', 'Could John Peden be sure the guitar he saw and partly captured on film was a 335? "I didn\'t know much about guitars then," John says, "but when I\'d come back home after seeing Dylan with a Strat at Newport in \'65, I had to \'go electric.\' I couldn\'t afford the used Strat for sale locally, and I had to settle for a cheaper 335. So I was naturally pleased to see Clapton playing a guitar like mine. He played that red Gibson that night at the Fillmore."', "The second interesting picture that turned up recently is from the U.S. leg of Cream's farewell tour, which ran from early October to early November '68. Most snaps that exist of the band on that tour show Eric playing a Firebird I or a Les Paul Burst, but this photograph, apparently from the LA Forum in October, has him with a Gibson ES model.", 'It was tempting to believe that this was a further potential sighting of the elusive 335. I asked Bob Adcock, Cream\'s tour manager, if he recalled Eric acquiring any new instruments at that time. "He didn\'t buy any new guitars on the last tour," Bob said. "I can be pretty certain of that, because if he had, it would have been me who would have paid for them out of the road float."', "On closer examination, the guitar in the Forum picture turns out to be an ES-355, most easily identified from a distance by its bound headstock, where a 335 has no binding. My guess is Eric borrowed it for a try-out. It's never seen again, so we can assume he passed on it.", "We're left with three possible scenarios—and I still favour number three.", 'Clapton Hideaway: Eric bought the Albert Hall 335 in 1964 while he was in The Yardbirds. He never played it at the time and instead kept it hidden away for years, only pulling it out for a gig at the Fillmore in 1967. Then he put it away again until the Albert Hall shows. Why would he go so long without using what is clearly a great guitar?', 'Fillmore Surprise: Eric bought the Albert Hall 335 in San Francisco in 1967, played it on one gig, and then put it away until the Albert Hall shows. Same question: Why would he avoid such a great guitar for so long?', 'Selmer Shopping: Eric bought the Albert Hall 335 in 1968, a few weeks before the London shows, from Jerry Donahue at the Selmer shop. How come Selmer had a four-year-old guitar, one that either had been in the shop a while or was secondhand? "I guess he wouldn\'t have cared at all whether the 335 was new or not," Jerry told me. "He really liked it—the feel, the sound—it was perfect. Certainly it took no time at all for him to get his wallet out."', 'Eric had a fine 335, whenever and however he got it. He profiled it in his 2013 book, Six-String Stories. "It was a rock guitar, a blues guitar—the real thing," Eric wrote. "It was played regularly over the years. It got on albums; it never really changed. It never got old; it never wore down. It never lost anything. I\'d play it now. Anything that\'s been that long in my life and is still functional—there aren\'t too many things that can command that kind of respect."', 'About the Author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

As early as the 1920s, record companies in both the U.K. and the U.S. were experimenting with location recording, albeit with incredibly primitive equipment. This was the pre-magnetic tape era, after all.', 'In the U.K., the pioneer was EMI, closely followed by its chief rival, Decca. The purpose, for the most part, was to record live concerts of classical music, and while the equipment changed out of recognition during the following 30 years or so, that purpose remained: to capture live performances.', "By the time rock music arrived around the mid '60s, a new generation of mobile studios appeared that would capture some of the most important recordings of the era. And curiously, most of them were not recordings of live gigs. That was because the mobile studio soon became used as much for the freedom it offered artists to record in domestic locations as for capturing their stage performances.", "Digital technology has helped bring about the demise of the mobile truck since the turn of the millennium. Now, artists can of course record on devices as small as an iPad (to name but one famous example, Damon Albarn recorded the Gorillaz album The Fall in just that way). Even if you don't want to be quite as stripped-down as Albarn, a laptop armed with plugins and a small digital mixer can offer almost as much as a fully fledged mobile studio at far less cost.", 'However, before the mobile trucks rumbled off into the distance, the freedom they provided in that short period produced some remarkable recordings. Here are six of them.', 'This album, still regarded by many critics as the finest live rock LP ever, was originally designed to be Live at Hull and Leeds. It was recorded by the Pye Records mobile on eight-track analogue tape machines installed beneath the auditorium in a cloakroom. At this stage, mobile trucks were used simply to carry recording equipment to a gig. That equipment then had to be removed, assembled, and used in whatever space could be found.', 'With nothing more than split cables from the vocal, speaker, and drum microphones, the two recordings were plagued with technical problems. Some of the bass track from Hull was lost, and the Leeds concert suffered from crackles, which have caused controversy ever since. Years later, when the crackles were erased using digital wizardry, some fans objected that they removed the authenticity of the recordings.', "Originally released as a single six-track vinyl LP, Live At Leeds has since appeared in many incarnations, some with and some without the infamous crackles. The Hull gig recorded the night before (February 13) has been released, too, with John Entwistle's missing bass parts replaced with carefully synced recordings from Leeds. There are those who claim that Live At Hull 1970 is even better than the raw and powerful Live At Leeds. They can both be heard on the 40th Anniversary collectors' edition.", "You could toss a coin over whether Led Zeppelin's III or IV was the more significant album, but it doesn't really matter for our purposes—both made very extensive use of the Rolling Stones Mobile (RSM) and were released before two other other landmark RSM recordings, the Stones' Exile On Main St. and Deep Purple's Machine Head.", "A former 18th-century poorhouse, Headley Grange in Hampshire was the chosen venue, as it had been for much of Zeppelin III. The majestic sound of John Bonham's drums—sampled a thousand times and still used today—was created in wood-paneled Headley Grange with a pair of distant Neumann condenser mics. It has probably never been equalled.", "Just as The Who's Live At Leeds is regarded by some as their finest hour, so the Stones' Exile On Main St. stands as a testament to the band at its peak—even if a wobbly one at times.", "In 1970, Mick Jagger bought Stargroves, a country house in Hampshire. The band's pianist and tour manager, Ian Stewart, suggested that in order to make full use of it, they needed their own mobile studio. This saw the birth of the most famous truck of them all, the Rolling Stones Mobile. It is one of the few things you can use the word legendary about without risk of exaggeration.", 'Unlike earlier trucks, the Stones Mobile had a control room inside the vehicle, so it really could go anywhere and do almost anything. The band used it to record most of the Sticky Fingers album, and a year later, beset with taxation problems, they decamped to the Villa Nellcôte in the South of France, with the RSM following.', 'The sessions that followed have become the stuff of rock legend and lore. Beside the technical problems imposed by an unsuitable recording environment—a cramped, damp basement—and compounded by an erratic power supply, the band\'s "personal issues" should have made the resulting album a shambles. Indeed, engineer Andy Johns described them as "the worst band in the world" for much of the time. But somehow, in true Stones fashion, what emerged from the chaos was one of rock\'s most memorable and charismatic albums. It just reeks of authenticity thanks, at least in part, to the location and the way in which most of it was recorded.', 'If Exile On Main St. really put the Stones Mobile on the map, it was Deep Purple who immortalized it in "Smoke On The Water." The song recalls the night in 1971 when the Casino in Montreux, Switzerland burned down following a gig by Frank Zappa and The Mothers Of Invention.', 'The plan had been to record the next Deep Purple album in the Casino, but the fire put paid to that. A couple of other venues in the town were hastily found for the recording sessions, which produced, among others, "Smoke On The Water," the lyrics of which refer to the RSM as "the Rolling truck Stones thing."', "On the face of it, this seems an unlikely album to have emerged from a mobile studio, and in fact it was made at an unlikely location, too. Ronnie Lane's Mobile (known as the LMS) was parked in Battersea, south-west London for much of the recording of Quadrophenia, in an urban jungle outside a still uncompleted Ramport Studios, which The Who were in the process of building.", "Ronnie Lane, the ex-Faces bass player, had chosen an American Airstream trailer for his mobile studio, and Bad Company, Led Zeppelin (notably on Physical Graffiti), Rick Wakeman, and Eric Clapton were just some of the musicians who would make excellent use of it. Of all the British golden-era mobiles, Lane's was one of the most successful.", "There were many impressive albums recorded using mobile studios between The Who's Live At Leeds in 1970 and Radiohead's OK Computer in 1997, and there were more mobiles than we have space to include here, among them Jethro Tull's Maison Rouge, Virgin's Manor Mobile, and Mickie Most's RAK.", "By the late '90s, however, the era of the truck was coming to an end—and OK Computer provides fitting mood music. Relatively inexpensive and highly portable digital equipment and computers meant that the need for a large studio on wheels was passing.", "In fact, OK Computer wasn't recorded using a truck at all, but it epitomizes why mobile trucks had been so popular: location recording enabled a band to work at their own pace, in their own way, in an environment completely unlike an essentially sterile fixed-site studio.", 'For this album, which Rolling Stone described as "the last masterpiece of the alt-rock movement," Radiohead were given a reputed £100,000 by their record company. Their producer Nigel Goodrich used it to buy recording equipment for use in St Catherine\'s Court, a spectacular manor house near Bath in Somerset, owned at the time by actress Jane Seymour. In the same way that the natural acoustics of Headley Grange helped Led Zeppelin achieve astonishing looseness, vitality, and depth, so St Catherine\'s Court added its brooding presence to a haunted, dark, and troubled album.', "One thing binds together the albums featured here: none of them could have been made in a traditional fixed-location recording studio. In the case of recordings of gigs, it's obvious why that should be. But a common quality shared by the albums featured here is the live ambience of an environment that wasn't carefully designed to sound neutral. In the age of Pro Tools sameness, that is definitely something to be cherished.", 'There is another angle, too. Musicians often complain that "clocking in" to record every day is too much like going to work, especially in a traditional city-center studio. In a residential location, they can not only experiment with different sounds but also socialize and make music in a freer and more creative way. You may not be able to quantify that. But if you listen hard you might be able to hear it.', 'About the Author: Gary Cooper is a journalist working in the musical instrument and pro audio fields.

Simply put, the classic electric guitar designs work, and they work very nicely. Why try to predict the future when the present is so safe? You may well ask. But some have tried—and failed—and here we take a look at six of them.", 'A number of them failed because they were ahead of their time, others were simply pushed aside, and some were clearly bonkers. See if you can tell the difference.', 'After World War II, Gibson seemed like a Midwest company still leaning heavily on tradition. So it was a surprise when it introduced in 1946 a guitar designed as much with visual impact in mind as musical performance. The Ultratone electric steel was designed for Gibson by Barnes & Reinecke, a Chicago firm of industrial designers, and it was a remarkable object, with sleek lines and prominent use of plastics.', 'At first known as the BR-1, the Ultratone had a solid maple body "enameled sparkling white." The fingerboard was transparent acrylic plastic, lacquered from below to look silver, with machined fret markers and lacquered position dots in yellow and red (which Gibson called "coral"). An acrylic decorative plate at the headstock, lacquered silver and white with a gold Gibson logo, covered the tuners, which had red plastic buttons injection-moulded by Kluson.', 'Another plastic cover at the bridge, lacquered red with a stylized motif alongside "Ultratone," revealed a single pickup and combined bridge and tailpiece. Three clear plastic knobs controlled volume, bass, and treble, and the jack was housed in a clear plastic plate at the rear edge behind the bridge. It was an impressive piece of modern musical art.', "The Ultratone steel was a dazzling addition to the company's lines, leaping out from the comparatively gloomy looking wood-body steels and Spanish guitars. It's interesting to speculate how things might have gone had Gibson employed Barnes & Reinecke to design its upcoming solidbody electric Spanish guitar, which became the Les Paul Model. The future of electric guitar design might have been very different indeed.", "Vox was a brand used by Jennings Musical Industries (JMI), owned by Tom Jennings, who established his Jennings Organ Company in the late '40s and JMI in the early '50s. JMI manufactured and distributed Vox amplifiers, devised by Dick Denney, and the firm's headquarters and factory were at Dartford, to the south-east of London. During 1959, Vox began also to produce guitars. At first these were budget models, but soon Jennings wanted a better instrument and told his in-house designers to produce a fresh design.", 'They came up with the Vox Phantom, introduced in 1961, which had a five-sided body without any of the curves of conventional designs. In contrast, the next new Vox was notably curvaceous. The Phantom Mk III, later renamed simply the Mark VI, was introduced in 1964. Its nickname, the teardrop, sums up its symmetrical body shape.', "An odd variation of the five-sided Phantom was Vox's Guitar Organ, the brainchild of Denney. It was first marketed in 1964 but did not reach full production until a few years later. The Guitar Organ's frets had special contacts connected to part of the innards of a Vox organ built into the instrument's body. It was intended to offer the player the ability to create organ sounds and guitar sounds, individually or simultaneously. But it was difficult to play, not least because the neck was wider at the nut than at the body. It did not last long, although the regular Phantom and Mark models survived in their original form until about 1968.", 'Ralph Jones started Micro-Frets in Frederick, Maryland, in 1967 with several products of his own inventive mind on display. His Micro-Nut allowed adjustment of the string length at the nut, in addition to the bridge, and Jones described this in his patent as "a method and apparatus for correcting the tuning of fretted and non-fretted instruments."', 'The Calibrato vibrato again centered on tuning accuracy, "a novel combination of individual string bridge and anchor means," and the Tonesponder body used a novel construction method where two wooden halves were joined with metal clips and a masonite-seam gasket. Micro-Frets guitars had a very thin Speedline neck, and it would be remiss to overlook an optional finish called Martian Sunburst, a sort of green to natural effect.', "Jones' most significant move came in 1968 with the Orbiter model, which had a built-in FM transmitter and an antenna on the upper horn. He got the idea from the growing popularity of wireless control for home garage doors. His was the first wireless system for a guitar—something we take for granted today, but at the time it must have seemed like magic. The outfit came with the necessary FM receiver, designed to plug into your amp and sit on top of it.", "The wireless system was also offered on other models, but very few were made. Wireless connections are everywhere today, of course, and it's a pity Ralph Jones did not live to see them. He died in 1972, and the original Micro-Frets business collapsed soon afterward.", "John Veleno wasn't the first to use metal for a guitar—think National for bodies, Wandrè for necks—but he was among the first to apply the idea to more or less the whole of an electric instrument. Based in St. Petersburg, Florida, Veleno began building his unusual guitars around 1970, making them almost entirely from hollow aluminum, with cast necks and hand-carved bodies, and finishing them in bright anodized colors, including gold. As a distinctive touch, some of them had a V-shape headstock into which Veleno set a small corundum ruby.", "Veleno's primary model was the Original, and he knew that one of the advantages of the rigid metal construction was good sustain. The neck had no need for a truss rod and was guaranteed never to warp, and it was said that the guitar could be stored for relatively long periods without relaxing the tension of the strings. A further benefit of the aluminum body, Veleno claimed, was that it naturally shielded the electrical components from outside interference.", "A second all-aluminum Veleno model was the 24-fret Traveler mini guitar, which measured just over 27 inches from top to tail. Demand for this proved even less than for the Original, and very few were sold. Travis Bean and Kramer developed a taste for aluminum necks later in the '70s, possibly influenced by Veleno's efforts, but Veleno's own operation didn't last long. He stopped production in 1977 after building around 185 guitars and became a wedding photographer, a much more predictable business.", 'Following some early attempts in the mid \'70s, there were a number of creations in the \'80s designed to link a guitar and a synthesizer. The most remarkable of these was the SynthAxe, a bizarre British concoction introduced in 1984. The press release said it was "not a guitar, nor a guitar synthesizer—it is a new type of musical instrument which gives a guitar player the means to plug into and play a variety of synthesizers."', "The instrument's designers, Bill Aitken and Mike Dixon, were unimpressed by the pitch-to-voltage converters used by earlier guitar synths, which sensed string vibration. Instead, they designed the SynthAxe to detect every nuance of a guitarist's techniques, including touch and bending, and convert these to MIDI signals.", "The frets on the SynthAxe's fingerboard were equally spaced and the strings on the long angled neck were not tuned to pitch. They were there to be sensed, not to make particular vibrations. There was a shorter set of pluckable strings on the body, plus six pressure- and velocity-sensitive keys that could trigger strings and enhance and alter their sound, along with three more controller pads. There was a vibrato-like arm, too, for pitch variation. The body itself was a piece of fiberglass—sculpted and un-guitar-like—with a cast metal chassis inside.", 'The SynthAxe was short-lived. Its high price tag of around $12,000 and the unconventional playing techniques it demanded meant that the majority of players ignored it. Fewer than one hundred were sold.', "Gibson's ex-CEO Henry Juszkiewicz always wanted to make the electric guitar into a modern object full of modern technology. When in late 2010 he smashed a guitar on stage at New York's Hard Rock Cafe during the launch of the Firebird X, some of the audience might have felt this was a fitting metaphor to mark the end of the electric guitar as we know it. Perhaps he should have smashed the Firebird X instead.", 'Four years earlier, Gibson began shipping its long-promised digital guitar, the HD.6X-Pro, a Les Paul with extra hex pickup that allowed the player to feed various combinations of strings to a computer for use with recording software. The next tech step came in 2007 with a series of Robot guitars. Various regular Gibsons were offered with the Robot self-tuning system, which used powered tuning pegs, an auto-tuning bridge, and a data-transmitting tailpiece to provide standard tuning plus six programmable tunings. The system was later redesigned as a self-contained unit mounted on the rear of the headstock, called Min-ETune and then (currently) G Force.', "Gibson's Dark Fire and Dusk Tiger guitars followed, and then in 2011 that peculiar Firebird X, a baffling take on a non-reverse Firebird. It had the Robot tuning, three multi-magnet pickups, a system to store, play, and edit 55 preset tones from among the onboard effects and models, computer connection through USB, and two Bluetooth'd controller pedals—among other things. Guitarists were baffled and have generally stayed away. Let's hope Gibson's new owners have taken note of this period of the company's recent history.", 'About the Author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

'https://reverb.com/news/how-to-make-your-own-tape-delay-using-an-old-reel-to-reel?_aid=tank'], ["When rock 'n' roll exploded in 1950s America, country music took a hit in popularity and radio play. Listeners were split—youngsters preferred the newfound edge of rock to the dated sounds of honky tonk, while many older audiences were having none of it and preferred the tamer sounds of their big-band crooners.", 'Recognizing that country music desperately needed to stay relevant, the industrious Nashville labels sought a more radio-friendly sound to appeal to the masses. Ground zero for this paradigm shift was RCA Records\' Studio B (as it became known, after the larger Studio A was built). There, producer Chet Atkins, audio engineer Bill Porter, and arranger/producer Anita Kerr—with her Anita Kerr Singers in tow—and the "A Team" of studio musicians like Hank Garland, Velma Williams Smith, Floyd Cramer, and Hargus "Pigs" Robbins polished their new approach. They dialed back the twang, added lush arrangements, and—along with like-minded studio\'s like Owen Bradley\'s Quonset Hut—gave rise to the Nashville Sound.', "From the late '50s on, Nashville churned out hundreds of country pop (or pop country) hits for the likes of Jim Reeves, Patsy Cline, and many, many more. And a big part in the appeal of this new sound lay in the Studio B team's ability to present artists like Elvis Presley, the Everly Brothers, and Roy Orbison as pop balladeers.", 'While recorded under producer Fred Foster instead of Atkins, Orbison\'s "Only the Lonely" from 1960 was typical of this approach. It featured Anita Kerr and her quartet, the core A Team band, and Porter\'s brilliant engineering.', "Studio B, while custom-built for RCA and state-of-the-art in many ways, still had plenty of issues and quickly hacked fixes. The frequency build-ups in parts of the room were so bad that Porter hung cheap fiberglass panels from the ceiling and marked the best, deadest spots on the floor with Xs. So if your home recording environment is less-than-ideal, don't be discouraged—just learn the particularities of your room and do what you can to mitigate problems.", 'For "Only the Lonely," Orbison wanted to forefront the quiet background vocals of Jim Nelson along with the Kerr singers, so Foster and Porter had everyone else play as quietly as possible. Still getting too much bleed into Orbison\'s mic, Porter piled blankets on a coat rack behind him. The resultant sound became Orbison\'s trademark.', "The Nashville Sound became one of the defining aesthetics of the era, influencing monumental releases far away from Nashville like Ray Charles' Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, and attracting a new generation of rockers, like Bob Dylan, to Nashville. (Dylan recorded four albums, from Blonde on Blonde to Self Portrait, with members of the A Team.)", 'Today, while a whole new variant of country pop dominates the country charts, there are still artists taking elements of the Nashville Sound and making them their own, as heard in recent records from Sturgill Simpson, Daniel Romano, First Aid Kit, Spiritualized, and Lana Del Rey (whose Ultraviolence was produced by Dan Auerbach at his Nashville studio).', "But musicians looking for some of the old Nashville magic don't need an army of session players, a world-class room, or a staggering production budget. Below, we're going to look at how you can craft the Nashville Sound in your home studio.", "Before diving into retro equipment and studio techniques, a little disclaimer is necessary. One of the biggest factors in the Nashville Sound isn't some secret recording technique or the signature sound of a legendary mixing desk. Rather, a combination of strong songwriting, effective arrangement, and tasteful orchestration played a large part in crafting the sound.", 'Analyzing some Nashville classics will reveal some common elements you can use in your compositions. The songs ranged from up-tempo numbers like Don Gibson\'s "Oh, Lonesome Me" to true slow-burners, but many tunes were medium-slow ballads, almost always in 4/4 or 3/4 time with a waltzy feel. Chord progressions were simple but powerful, with satisfying turnarounds to resolve them. Flowing, legato vocal melodies were often echoed by lead instruments.', 'In addition to country staples like acoustic guitars, pedal steel, and upright bass, the Nashville Sound was defined by lush string sections, choir-like background vocals, and silky horns. Every instrument served a specific role, leaving space for the other elements to shine through and helping the song become more than the sum of its parts. And of course, everything revolved around the lead vocal. Which brings us to...', 'Unlike the rough-around-the-edges yodelers of traditional country, practitioners of the Nashville Sound were often highly trained vocalists with as much in common with Sinatra as The Singing Brakeman. Their delivery was measured and confident, every syllable was crisp, and their vibrato was impeccable. Before you step in front of the microphone, run through your song a few times focusing on pitch and breath. When recording, take your time and enunciate.', 'Whether or not you decide to truly croon, a high-quality signal chain like the ones used in Studio B can help bring out the depth and dynamic range of your voice. It all starts with the microphone.', 'Porter helped bring out more of the lead vocal by using tube-powered condenser mics like the Telefunken U 47 and Neumann M49 instead of the RCA 44BX ribbon mics that were so popular for vocalists in previous eras.', 'The high-frequency information that such condensers can provide brings out the air of the vocals. Especially when sitting on top of more muted background singers and instruments, it can center the lead in a powerful way. While those specific models are very expensive these days, you can find more affordable models inspired by the originals like the Bock iFet and the Neumann TLM 49. (About the cheapest tube-powered condenser you can find is the Avantone Audio CV-12.)', "You can also try an exciter plugin like the Waves Aphex Vintage Aural Exciter or the AudioThing Valve Exciter to add some higher harmonic content to whatever vocal mic you have on hand. Then, you can boost the higher frequencies further with your DAW's EQ as well.", 'As can be seen in photos from Studio B, RCA 44 ribbon mics—which taper off higher frequencies and have an upper range of 15kHz—were still used for background vocals, as well as strings and other instruments. While still fairly expensive, there are clones of those vintage units, including the Cloud 44-A and the AEA R44CE. For ribbon-mic-style background vocals without a ribbon mic, try using whatever vocal mic you already own, but use an EQ to mimic the frequency response of a vintage ribbon: Add a bit of a bump to the low-mids and roll-off the highs.', "To reinforce the lead vocal with big choir sounds, you could gather three to six people around a single mic if you have enough friends or bandmates. Close harmonies are great if you can craft them, but unison vocals could make their own impact. If you're doing it all yourself, you can simply layer overdubs until the part sounds full enough. Try harmonizing with yourself and singing each part with a slightly different inflection to make it sound a little more like an actual choir. Or, you can use plugins like Celemony Melodyne or iZotope Nectar 3 to form dense harmonies from a single vocal take with your mouse or MIDI controller.", "Recording gear like RCA's custom-made console at Studio B, along with its analog preamps, EQs, and compressors, is likely prohibitively expensive for the vast majority of home studios. If your budget's tight, tube channel strips like the ART Voice Channel offer an all-in-one solution that will make any mic come alive with analog character. A great tube-powered desktop mic pre is the Universal Audio Solo/610.", 'The acoustic guitar is a major staple of country music, but in this particular style it\'s not so much the star of the show as a supporting character. Typically, it sticks to a simple quarter- or eighth-note strumming pattern, emphasizing rhythm over melody. When the song demands a thick guitar sound, double-track with a twelve-string or a "Nashville-tuned" guitar (replace the four lowest strings with thin 12-string gauges and tune an octave higher) for a natural chorus effect.', "With a producer like Chet Atkins, electric guitars could play a dominant or strong supporting role in the arrangement of song, either as dreamy, tremolo-drenched chords and melodic lines or as punctuating lines behind a vocal or piano melody. Pictures from recording sessions often show Atkins with some variant of the Gretsch Country Gentleman or similar semi-hollowbody archtops—with their humbucking Filter'Tron pickups.", "While vintage Gretsches are affordable compared to vintage Fenders and Gibsons from the same era, you can also find all manner of after-market Filter'Tron pickups for your existing guitar—with some companies even outfitting Strat pickguards with Filter'Trons loaded in.", 'For an authentic tone, plug into a clean tube amp with a little reverb or tremolo and record with a dynamic or ribbon mic a foot or so from the speaker cone. Atkins often used vintage Gibson amps like the GA-77. For classic spring reverb and tremolo sounds in a pedal, check out the EHX Oceans 11 or the Source Audio True Spring Reverb.', "Electric and upright bass are equally at home in country music, but the latter is the more authentic choice for a '50s Nashville sound. Quite the opposite of rockabilly's frantic plucking, country bass usually plods along following the root, third, and fifth of the chords. To approximate the sound of a standup bass, throw some flatwound strings on an electric and pluck close to the middle for a mellower tone. Record the acoustic sound of your playing and blend it with the amp signal for the finishing touch.", "Lush string and horn sections illuminated countless Nashville hits, but if you're reading this article, chances are you don't have room to mic up an entire string section. Luckily, sampled instruments have advanced to the point of being nearly indistinguishable from real performances (with proper programming). Software companies like EastWest and Best Service make fantastic plugins that put the sound of real ensembles at your fingertips.", "While you don't need a degree from Juilliard to add a compelling arrangement to your song, there is a bit of a learning curve to using virtual strings and horns. You'll need to switch between different articulations like legato, staccato, and pizzicato to create a convincing part, and avoid writing parts outside the range of real instruments. Applying a tiny bit of randomization to the timing and velocity will give the part a more organic sound.", "Plugins are also great for replicating other instruments that you may not have access to, like pianos, organs, vibraphones, chimes, and harps. If writing parts isn't your strong suit, certain plugins let you mix and match pre-recorded phrases in the key of your song for effortless results.", "A well-crafted arrangement played by skilled musicians should practically mix itself, but using certain old-school techniques can give your mix an era-appropriate sound. First, try mixing in mono. Many classic Nashville recordings were made before stereo became a common format, so mono is key if you're going for authenticity. Even if your mix ends up in stereo, starting with no panning at all will force you to perfect the levels and phase relationships in your track first.", "When it comes to effects, stick with the historical classics. In the '50s, engineers were limited to tape delays, echo chambers, and plate- or spring-based reverb devices for adding space and depth to vocals and instruments. Porter loved using the EMT 140 plate reverb (which he kept chilled with air conditioning for a tighter tone).", "Fortunately, plugins like Soundtoys EchoBoy, Softube Spring Reverb, and Soundtoys Little Plate do a fine job recreating these timeless effects in the box. But if you don't have the budget for new toys or simply prefer analog sounds, there are some cool DIY options available as well. For example, an ordinary basement or garage can become a makeshift echo chamber with a spare PA speaker and a room mic, and with a little technical know-how it's possible to make your own tape delay with an old reel-to-reel machine.", 'Convolution reverb is another helpful tool, which allows you to use the acoustic characteristics of real spaces in a mix. All sorts of spaces have been sampled—impulse responses are available for churches, parking garages, famous studios, and even real echo chambers. Sending a little of everything in your mix to a convolution reverb (post fader, to preserve levels and panning) will put everything in the same virtual space, making it sound closer to the elaborate live sessions of yore.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

'https://reverb.com/news/jimmy-page-appears-in-new-fender-video-announcing-signature-telecaster', 'https://reverb.com/brand/fender'], ["Jimmy Page's announcement of new signature Telecasters comes almost exactly 30 years since Fender released its very first signature models, although even then the idea of a signature or artist model was hardly a new one.", 'Way back in the 1920s, it was Gibson who jumped on the popularity of Nick Lucas, the first American to become a big star through guitar-and-vocal hits. Nick\'s bestsellers included "I\'m Looking Over A Four Leaf Clover" (1927) and "Tip-Toe Thru The Tulips With Me" (1929), and he also cut some fine guitar-centric stuff like "Pickin\' The Guitar" and "Teasin\' The Frets."', "Gibson's Nick Lucas flattop first appeared in 1927. For a while I thought this might qualify as the first signature-model guitar—and then I saw in Steve Howe's fabulous collection a guitar called a Bambina, which dated from about 1870. It was a tiny classical-like instrument with a 13-inch scale, designed by Catharina Josepha Pratten (aka Madame Sidney Pratten) who was a well-known guitar teacher in London at that time. She signed labels, and her French guitar-maker stuck them inside the guitars that she sold on to her eager pupils. The first signature guitar, perhaps?", "Anyway, let's jump forward into electric endorsement land, where there was a flurry of signature guitars in the early '50s, starting with models for Les Paul (Gibson, in 1952), Chet Atkins (Gretsch, 1955), and Barney Kessel (Kay, 1957). Those players had little to do with the design of their sig models, and the makers simply put a famous player's name on what were largely their own designs in order to help sell more guitars.", "Jump a little further forward, and we arrive in the '80s for the promised 30th birthday celebrations. Fender had a new management team who wanted to improve the brand's fading image. One of the ways they decided to do this was to cozy up to some famous Fender guitarists, hoping for a light sprinkling of their personal fairy dust.", 'At first, Fender talked to James Burton about the possibility of a signature model, but James had to wait until 1990 for his signature Tele to appear. (Or maybe that should read sort-of-Tele, as it would have three single-coils in a Strat layout.)', "It was Eric Clapton and Yngwie Malmsteen who came first. In 1988, these two artists introduced Fender's debut signature guitars, as their autographs appeared on some Strat headstocks. And now, the modern signature guitar had a difference: Guitarists were firmly involved in the design of their artist models.", "Eric might at one time have been a Gibson man, but he'd nursed a soft spot for Strats since 1958 when, as an impressionable 12-year-old, he'd watched Buddy Holly playing one on the British TV show Sunday Night At The London Palladium. He recalled later it was like seeing an instrument from outer space, and he said to himself: That's the future—that's what I want.", "The future in this particular form arrived for Eric in London in 1967, when he bought a '56 Strat, a guitar that would become known as Brownie, and which he began using regularly a couple of years later when he toured with Delaney & Bonnie. He also put it to good use on his first solo album, Eric Clapton, in 1970 (it's pictured on the jacket), and on the Layla album recorded later that year.", 'Also in 1970, Eric bought six or so old Strats in Nashville. He gave one each to George Harrison, Pete Townshend, and Steve Winwood, and botched together various bits of the others to make one fine Stratocaster for himself. This guitar became better known as Blackie, and he used that one as his main live and studio electric for 15 years or so.', "Enter Fender. Eric knew Blackie was coming to the end of its useful life, and he began talking to Fender about a modern replacement. His main focus was to get a neck shape that felt right, and George Blanda and Dan Smith at Fender made about a dozen neck samples for him to try. Two stood out, but Eric couldn't quite decide between them. One was like a pre-war Martin he had, with a very deep V shape, while the other had a kind of soft, rounded V—more like Blackie.", 'Fender had given Eric one of its Elite Strat models, and he liked the sound of its active circuit. He wanted something similar, but with more boost, which he called compression. With all this in mind, Blanda and Smith delivered prototypes to Eric in 1986 while he was recording August in Los Angeles. He then went on an extended tour, mostly playing a prototype with the Martin-like deep V neck, but that developed a fault and was sent back for repair. So he switched to the one with the Blackie-like neck. He soon decided that was the one he liked best.', 'Fender developed a production version, which went on sale to the public in 1988 as the Eric Clapton Stratocaster. Fender delivered Eric\'s "compressed" sound by combining Lace Sensor pickups with a midrange-boosting active circuit. The production model also offered a blocked-off vintage-style vibrato unit, carefully duplicating that feature of Eric\'s favored set-up—because although he never used the vibrato, he nonetheless disliked the sound of hardtail Strats.', "Eric retired Blackie around this time and soon began playing his new signature models, and he's continued to do so more or less ever since. A change came to the production model around 2001, with a shift to Fender's Noiseless pickups, and in 2004 a high-end Custom Shop version was added to the line.", "Fender released in 1988 a second signature model, the Yngwie Malmsteen Stratocaster. The most obvious feature of the Swedish guitarist's instrument was its scalloped fingerboard, the inspiration for which had come early. When he was about 13, Yngwie saw a lute with a scalloped board, and from then on he made sure all his guitars had the feature. The idea was that the absence of physical contact with the fingerboard enabled him to play even faster than his lightning technique allowed.", "Another feature of the new Malmsteen Strat was its DiMarzio pickups at the neck and bridge plus a Fender in the middle, along with a brass nut and old-style narrow headstock and two-pivot vibrato. That was changed to a six-pivot unit around 1998, and at the same time the model gained a '70s-style wide headstock, as well as the truss-rod adjustment moving to the headstock from the body. A further change around 2007 saw the headstock truss-adjuster seated in a metal bullet rather than the earlier walnut plug, and four years later the model gained Duncan pickups and Dunlop flush-mounted straplocks.", "As well as these U.S.-made Malmsteen Strats, there were a number of Japanese-made versions. Fender Japan had featured Yngwie prominently in its catalogues since the mid-'80s and produced several models, including the ST72 Strats, that at first had Malmsteen features, if not the headstock autograph and official signature-model designation (but always the wide headstock). Similar Japanese-made models with Yngwie's signature on the headstock first appeared in the early '90s.", "Following those first two signature models from Fender 30 years ago, in 1988, the company has added dozens more. Some have proved short-lived, while others have lasted years in the catalogue. The Clapton and Malmsteen Strats are the longest running, still in Fender's line today.", "Fender's signature Strats have ranged from Tom DeLonge's model with a simple humbucker and single control to the Stevie Ray Vaughan guitar with a giant SRV logo emblazoned on the pickguard. Further sig Strats have been issued for Jeff Beck, Dick Dale, The Edge, David Gilmour, Buddy Guy, Bonnie Raitt, Robin Trower, and many others.", "The trend has also been evident in Fender's Telecaster lines, where various signature Telecasters followed the debut of a trio of models in 1990: that James Burton original, plus Teles named for Albert Collins and Danny Gatton.", 'More Tele sigs have since tumbled from the Fender factories, honoring players as diverse as Jimmy Bryant, Jerry Donahue, John 5, Jim Root, Joe Strummer, Muddy Waters, and Clarence White.', "And let's not forget the signature Jaguars for Johnny Marr and Kurt Cobain or the signature Jazzmasters for Troy Van Leeuwen and J Mascis, among others.", "But what of the big question hanging over all these instruments? Why would anyone want to play someone else's guitar? Personal preferences are just that—your tweaks, your fiddles, your mods help your guitar suit your way of playing. But surely they would not suit everyone. So why would Star X's instrument suit you?", "Fans of a certain guitarist who want some of that mojo for themselves might figure that getting hold of a guitar just like his or hers will do the trick. More seasoned players might tell you that this is but a small part of the formula. They'll say that you'll be needing Star X's head, hands, and heart, too, if you really want to get inside how they play the way they do.", "Is it the player or is it the guitar? That debate will run and run. In the meantime, it wouldn't be a bad idea to start practicing your signature. There's a knack to making it fit snugly on the headstock of your choice. That way, when Mr. Fender comes knocking, you'll be ready for him, just like Jimmy Page.", 'About the Author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

some extent at least, on circuits that originated in guitar amps way back in the '50s and '60s.", 'Makers have strung all sorts of bells and whistles around these original templates—in the form of multiple foot-switchable channels, effects loops, added gain stages, and so on—but scratch the surface, and maybe nine out of 10 amps on the market today reveal the ghost of a circuit that was first

Plenty of players rediscovered the glories of its easily achieved grind and raw, textured overdrive tones after most other tweed amps had gone out of fashion, and it has been a studio and small-club favorite ever since.', 'The 5E3 remains popular in its own right exactly as it was first conceived, both via reissues from Fender itself, and in myriad clones from makers like Victoria, Clark, Tungsten, Tyler Ampworks, Speed Shop, Magic Amps, Greer, and several others. In addition, it\'s been a very popular "first kit" for many players going the DIY road, via suppliers such as Weber, Mojotone, Mission, and others.', 'Beyond the efforts that outwardly represent themselves as accurate emulations of the original article, though, many other great guitar amps offered over the years—and today—reveal an enormous proportion of the tweed Deluxe template once you dig beneath the surface, even if they ultimately take the design elsewhere.', "Amps from highly regarded boutique makers such as Matchless and Divided by 13 have adapted the 5E3 circuit to their Spitfire (with a different phase inverter and EL84 output tubes) and CJ11 (with a modified preamp), respectively, while Carr's impressive new Telstar combo also uses this classic as a jumping-off point, before adding several original features and design twists. Lazy J's highly acclaimed, British-made J20 is also essentially just a beefed-up and well-put-together tweed Deluxe.", "In essence, almost any smaller-mid-sized combo that generates 15 to 20 watts from a pair of cathode-biased 6V6 output tubes, partnered by two preamp tubes and a simple control panel with just volume and tone knobs is likely to have been derived from the 5E3 blueprint. If the amp also uses the tweed-era split-load (aka cathodyne) phase inverter, you know you're really in tweed Deluxe territory. Some makers substitute different or more powerful output tubes and add a variety of modifications without entirely fully disguising the DNA of the original.", 'This classic 4x10" combo from the late \'50s became one of Fender\'s most popular amps for guitar, rather than for the bass for which it was designed. And it has remained that way ever since—both as a straight repro or reissue, or as the foundation for near countless amps that have been derived from its circuit. As is the way with many classic amps that are found in modern circuits, though, the much-lauded 5F6A tweed Bassman didn\'t just pop up years later as the inspiration for something new, but evolved within many of the greatest tube amps ever made throughout the history of rock.', 'This late-\'50s model was already beloved on both sides of the pond when Fender changed up the Bassman formula for the blonde piggyback amps of the early \'60s. Many players, however, still thought the old "tweed suitcase" sounded better for guitar.', 'Such was the impression of former jazz drummer and London music-store owner Jim Marshall and his cohorts Ken Bran and Dudley Kraven, who used the 5F6A Bassman circuit as the foundation of their own JTM45 amplifier in 1962. Marshall and co. virtually lifted the entire tweed Bassman circuit part for part, value for value, although they had to use more readily available British- and European-made components, which changed up the formula just a little.', "With the Plexi models of the late '60s and others that followed, Marshall changed a few details in the preamp to make the amp brighter, as well as making a few other alterations (eventually dropping the tube rectifier too), but a good 85 percent or so of the circuit remained easily traceable to the original Fender 5F6A schematic, including essential elements such as the cathode-follower tone stage, long-tailed-pair phase inverter, and fixed-bias output stage with negative feedback.", 'Even as Marshalls evolved through the "hot-rodded" amps of the late \'70s and \'80s—the 2203 and 2204 Master Model amps—which carried master volume controls and, often, cascading-gain preamp stages, the foundation remained solidly 5F6A-based, as do many of the company\'s most popular models today.', "What that also means, of course, is that any of today's very popular breed of Marshall-inspired amp heads you might encounter also carries a major chunk of tweed Fender Bassman DNA. Friedman Small Box head or combo, Friedman's Dirty Shirley, or whathaveyou? Yep.", "Several amps by Germino, Bogner's Helios 50- and 100-watt and others, TopHat's Emplexador, several Reinhardts, 3rd Powers, and way too many to count also trace direct roots via the Marshall thing to the tweed Bassman.", "Alongside all of this, it's worth noting that the blonde Bassman head of the early '60s and blackface Bassman of the mid-'60s, although great guitar amps in their own right, had circuits that were different in many ways, and were far less an evolution of the tweed Bassman than were the British amps that carried the torch into the modern era.", "Never mind that the circuit Vox used to create its Top Boost modification to the original AC30 model contained DNA from a Gibson tone circuit of the late '50s, which was also kissing cousins with the treble-and-bass cathode-follower tone circuit in Fender's medium-sized tweed amps of the '50s. This JMI-made English classic put it all together with many other ingredients to create a sound all its own, and a guitar tone for the ages.", 'Alongside the tweed Bassman (and therefore Plexi-derived) circuits, the AC30 is one of the most-tapped of the boutique amp era, while still appearing in many mass-manufactured guitar amps as well. Basically, any time you find a guitar amp with three 12AX7-style preamp tubes (excluding any extras for reverb, tremolo, or effects loops), both Treble and Bass controls, and four cathode-biased EL84 output tubes with no negative feedback (often colloquially referred to as "Class A"), chances are it pays homage to the original AC30 Top Boost.', "Among several such suspects are the Blackstar Artisan 30, Matchless DC30/SC30/HC30, TopHat King Royale, Bad Cat Black Cat, Divided by 13 RSA 31, Morgan AC20/AC40, Valvetech Heyseed, Dr. Z Z Wreck, 3rd Power Dream 40 AC, Bruno Underground 30, and several others. Modified elements of the AC30 are also found in footswitchable multi-channel amps like Mesa's TA-30 (and deleted Maverick model), and Orange's AD30HTC. Many makers add a midrange control to the Top Boost circuit, but this doesn't change the amps' lineage all that much.", "Smaller 15-watt amps today that might outwardly appear more AC15-like are actually more AC30s with only two EL84s instead of four (note that the original AC15 of the '60s never had the Top Boost circuit). On the other hand, amps that also include a channel with an EF86 pentode preamp tube are also tapping that part of the original AC15 magic, which was derived from that circuit. Dr. Z's Maz 18, TopHat's Club Royale and Supreme 16, Matchless's Lightning and many others are all very much AC30-derived—if in modified form—despite being 15- to 20-watt amps.", "Of course, today's Korg-owned Vox also makes several outstanding variations on the AC30 and AC15, some of which are relatively true to the original (in so much as it is possible in 2018, and at a given price point), while others add modifications and variations to enhance versatility.", 'Almost any amp that boasts a "blackface tone" will use elements from the Twin Reverb\'s preamp stage, especially if it includes a midrange control. Those with just treble and bass will lean more Deluxe Reverb, but they are largely similar otherwise—the Deluxe generating 22 watts from two 6V6s, the Twin 85 watts from four 6L6s. While newer makers have changed up the output formula in many ways, and added other bells and whistles, the similar preamp stages in these two classic mid-\'60s Fenders have found their way into countless new designs.', "The preamp circuit in these blackface amps, and the tone stage in particular—which also evolved into the silverface amps of the late '60s and '70s—was an original creation from Leo Fender and co., and very different from the cathode-follower stage of the tweed amps (as discussed above). Each of the two channels found in most original Fender models from this era had their tone controls sandwiched between the first and second gain stages of a single 12AX7 (or 7025) preamp tube, with the volume control following the treble control in the signal chain. Almost any time you find that topology in an amp today, you're looking at something derived from the Fender circuit.", "When Howard Dumble started building his creamy-toned lead amps in the late '60s and early '70s to meet guitarists' needs for overdrive at controllable volumes, he used these Fender circuits as a starting point, adding on an overdrive stage after a modified rendition of the Twin Reverb preamp. He did plenty else besides, but that's at the root of the design.", 'As a result, any of the many Dumble-inspired amps on the market today from makers like Fuchs, Amplified Nation, Bludotone, RedPlate and others will reveal some blackface-Fender DNA. Other amps built without the high-gain overdrive stage are even more directly linked to the classic blackface tone. More in this vein are the RedPlate Blackverb, Fargen Blackbird, TopHat Ambassador, Allen Old Flame and Accomplice, and plenty of others.', 'Of course, the most famous, and most successful, modified-blackface-style amps—and the one that makes for a real wolf in sheep\'s clothing as far as that\'s concerned—are the original Mesa/Boogie Mark Series amps, and many models that have followed those. Like the Fender circuit, the Boogie\'s takes the signal from the input to the first gain stage, then through the tone controls (using similar component values to Fender, in many places) before hitting its first volume control (labeled "Gain" in this case) and onward to the second gain stage... and many more, to create that famous cascading-gain overdrive tone when Lead mode is engaged.', "Even with the great breadth and variety of tube guitar amps available today, the vast majority of circuits within them will have discernible reference points to the classic designs discussed above. And if they don't, chances are they bear links to another classic that we can explore another time… unless they really are original.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

The neck is in the Bean Artist model profiles but with dot inlays, while the all-black back of the body carries a unique Imron-coated rear plate.", "The guitar was not fully assembled and never made it to Jerry in the '70s, but was stored with all its parts until its recent assembly by Burkett and his team at EGC. Everything was done with the original components with the exception of the 500K CTS push-pull pots. You can read more about the assembly of the guitar on the Reverb listing.", "The second guitar on the block this week is an example of the TB500, the smaller entry in the Travis Bean catalog and the one you can see in the hands of Steve Albini. This model was originally intended as a more affordable offering for the high-end brand and originally carried a lower price tag than the rest of the Bean guitar line. Far fewer were made though, and on today's market, the TB500s typically sell at higher prices than the more common TB1000S and TB1000A.", 'The TB500 was made in two different runs and with somewhat differing shapes, and this guitar comes from the much rarer first batch that included only 20 guitars. This guitar is serial number #14 and since Bean serials started at #11 it would be the third one built.

We'll get to the model detail later, but first, let's backtrack. By the time Pink Floyd were making this recording in 1972, they were just one of many acts using synths built by EMS, a British company that for a few years gave Moog a run for its money.", 'EMS was Electronic Music Studios (London) Ltd., formed around 50 years ago by Peter Zinovieff, Tristram Cary, and David Cockerell. Zinovieff in particular considered EMS a sideline, yet the story of EMS (along with that of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop) became the defining narrative in the emergence of British electronic music.', "Zinovieff, a geologist, applied a scientist's analytical bent to his interest in electronic music, which began in the late '50s. Initially, he followed contemporary electronic trends and bought tape recorders and military-surplus sound wave generators. But he concluded that tape music was a dead end.", '"I couldn\'t stand the fiddliness of it," he told me when we met in 2011. "I decided very soon that sequencers were the answer—that\'s ultimately what led me to computers."', "This was the early '60s, when computers were room-sized monsters way out of the reach of your average aspiring electronic composer. Zinovieff, though, was independently wealthy, on account of family money. He lived in Putney, southwest London, in a house with a garden that ran down to the River Thames.", 'Here he built a semi-subterranean studio for his expanding collection of electronic equipment, the heart of which was a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-8 computer. The U.S.-produced PDP-8, introduced in 1965, was the first mass-produced microcomputer. Zinovieff paid about £4,000 for his—more than the average price of a house at the time—and was almost certainly the first person in the UK to privately own a computer. It had 8k of memory and no hard drive. He bought later a 32k hard drive, which cost the same again.', 'It was to this riverside studio that Paul McCartney came to meet Zinovieff, though the illustrious visitor made little impression. "I was much more interested in Stockhausen coming than Paul McCartney coming," he told me. "I myself steered clear of pop groups."', 'Stockhausen did come, but so did plenty of "pop" musicians, including Jon Lord, David Bowie, and Robert Fripp. The Putney studio was a magnet for anyone interested in exploring experimental electronic music.', 'The studio\'s computer achieved some fame in its own right when it appeared at a 1968 concert of electronic music at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, on London\'s Southbank. An audience of 1,800 heard music by several leading composers, including Cary. When Zinovieff\'s PDP-8 was wheeled on to "perform," the critic Hugo Cole remarked in The Guardian that "the effect on the listener is often baffling… we are all innocents when faced with this music, and the most we can hope for is to misunderstand in a fruitful manner."', 'Zinovieff was a visionary who as far back as 1960 saw that computer sequencing was the way forward for electronic music. He was proved right, eventually. But first came the synthesizer, and Zinovieff had a part in that, too—almost in spite of himself.', "By 1968, his Putney studio was greedily swallowing cash. He continued with his own experiments while allowing composers such as Harrison Birtwistle and Stockhausen to use the facilities for free. Even the Zinovieff family's pockets weren't deep enough to endlessly finance the venture, and there was a pressing need for other funding.", "Tristram Cary, the founding father of British electronic music, was a regular visitor to the studio. When he formed EMS with Zinovieff and David Cockerell (who was Zinovieff's engineer, and later worked at Electro-Harmonix and Akai) the idea was to knock out some synths to make money to keep the big computer studio operational.", 'The first EMS product was the Voltage Controlled Studio-3, better known as the VCS-3 or the Putney. It was conceived as an affordable modular synthesizer in miniature and was the first portable synthesizer offered on the open market, beating the Minimoog by a year.', "With three oscillators, a filter, an envelope generator, and a ring modulator in a wooden case about the size of a small desk, it looked something like a child's model of a big Moog modular synth. But EMS dispensed with patch leads in favour of a matrix panel where connections were made with coloured pins, like something from a travel chess set.", "There was no keyboard, but there was a joystick, adapted from the radio-control mechanism of a model aircraft. It also included an integral amplifier, stereo speakers, and stereo inputs. This last feature appealed to The Who's Pete Townshend, who we'll come to shortly.", 'The VCS-3 first went on sale in November 1969 at just under £330. By comparison, at the time a Fender Stratocaster cost about £240. So though hardly a budget instrument, it was within reach of more than the super-wealthy, and it was cheaper than the equivalent small Moog and ARP synthesizers that followed.', 'Hundreds were sold, with customers including Brian Eno, who proved a dab hand with the VCS-3\'s joystick on Roxy Music\'s 1972 debut album. A year earlier, Pete Townshend fed a Lowrey organ into the VCS-3\'s stereo inputs, creating the heartbeat that drives "Won\'t Get Fooled Again." Other users, before and after, included Tangerine Dream, Arthur Brown, Jean-Michel Jarre, and John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin.', 'The VCS-3 was flawed and limited. Getting the same sound twice was always a challenge. Yet it was, and remains, the product with which the company is associated. For Zinovieff, though, it was little more than a cash cow. As far as he was concerned, the real EMS work was his computer studio in Putney, the cost of which could not be ignored. Which meant that EMS had to expand its range.', 'Other products included the Synthi A (essentially a VCS-3 in a secret-agent-like attaché case), the aforementioned Synthi AKS (a Synthi A with a keyboard and sequencer in the lid of the case), and the Synthi 100 (a large modular setup to rival the big Moogs).', "The company invested heavily in the Hi-Fli, a guitar multi-effects processor, advertised by Gilmour and also used on Dark Side Of The Moon. But demand for the Hi-Fli didn't live up to expectations, and its commercial failure contributed to the demise of EMS in 1979. Zinovieff's studio was briefly relocated to rural Oxfordshire before it was dismantled and stored in the basement of the National Theatre in London—where, eventually, it was destroyed in a flood.", "EMS later re-emerged as, literally, a cottage industry in Cornwall. Robin Wood, who'd started with the company as a cleaner in 1970, began handmaking a small number of EMS products there, mainly VCS-3s to original specifications. His customers included Oasis and Radiohead, two among many acts formed way after the original company's demise but who succumbed to the VCS-3's allure.", "Others include Aphex Twin, Vince Clarke, and LCD Soundsystem. In 2015, Portishead's Adrian Utley took his VCS-3 to Zinovieff's Cambridge home to be signed by the now octogenarian revolutionary, who was living in retirement and reflecting on all that happened—and what might have been.", 'About the Author: Mark Brend is an author and a musician.

Drummers might lust after vintage Gretsch or Slingerland kits, but no one gets more misty eyed than a guitarist when confronted with a golden-age Martin, Gibson, or Fender.', "Suppose, however, you're a guitar maker who doesn't happen to own one of those illustrious brand names, yet you still want some rock 'n' roll magic attached to your products? One way is to revive a dormant brand.", "Even if its name is only a hazy memory in most guitarists' imaginations, it might still have some fairy dust on its boots. Some have tried it and failed. Others have had more success. Here are a few of them. Oh, and a few more that are still candidates for Baron Frankenstein's attention, should he happen to be reading.", "This is a bit cheeky, because Epiphone never actually died, although it did get pretty close back in the '50s. Founded in New York by a Greek violin maker and luthier, the Epiphone name came from Epi Stathopoulo, the founder's son and company president. By 1930, and already known as a banjo maker, Epiphone was offering its Masterbilt guitars, and it went on to rival Gibson as the top jazz guitar maker of the era with its Emperor and other archtop models.", "Epi Stathopoulo died in 1943, and in 1951 a major strike saw the company attempt to move to Philadelphia. Several key figures in the business didn't want to make the journey, and they became the core of the newly formed Guild company. Epiphone never really recovered from the blow, and the company was sold in 1957 to CMI, which also owned Gibson.", "Epiphone shared premises in Gibson's hometown of Kalamazoo, and its guitars from that era—acoustics as well as electrics—are much sought-after today as they were much the same as the guitars Gibson were making in the same town. Gibson may have intended Epiphone to be its lower-cost line, but the instruments were usually superb and had plenty of users in the '60s, the Beatles and the Stones among them.", "By the '70s, Epiphones were being made in Japan and were no longer going head-to-head with Gibsons. Following the industry pattern, production then moved to Korea and, by the early 2000s, to China. By now Epiphone was fulfilling the role previously filled by other makers' cheap Gibson copies.", "However, a few instruments were made once again in the USA in the '90s, and the brand received a major injection of cool when Epiphones were used by Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher, with his armoury including an Epiphone Les Paul Standard, a Sheraton, and a Riviera. Gallagher wasn't alone: other well known players, including Alex Lifeson and Nancy Wilson, also played Epiphones. The guitars are primarily licensed Gibson copies, but Epiphones have somehow maintained a character and following of their own. Truly a brand that wouldn't die!", "Shergold's guitars share a family likeness with the UK's Burns guitar brand, not least because they had supplied Burns with some woodwork in the '60s. Jack Golder and Norman Houlder, the two founders of Shergold, had also produced Hayman and Ned Callan guitars in the early '70s, but they enjoyed a peak from the mid-'70s to around 1980 with their own Shergold brand, producing some seriously different guitars and basses.", "Highlights included a notable double neck bass, six, and 12-string guitar used by Mike Rutherford from Genesis. A bass, a six, and a 12? Yes! The necks were exchangeable! Famously light in weight—the bodies were made of obeche—a Shergold doubleneck wasn't the usual daunting prospect. Another major-name user was New Order's Peter Hook, famous for his six-string Marathon basses.", "Shergold's Modulator range, meanwhile, featured interchangeable electronics modules which could be used right across the range from guitars to basses, allowing the user to completely rewire the guitar with a plug-in module. Several different options were made, including a quadrophonic version. The basic Shergold was the Meteor (£150 when new) which, while pretty basic, shared the blazingly fast neck that was a characteristic of all Shergolds.", "The brand went dormant in the early '80s, although some custom models were assembled from stock parts. A brief revival followed in 1991/'92, when Masquerader guitars and Marathon basses were being sold, but the latest revival came in 2015. In that year, a major UK distributor, which had handled the original Shergolds, worked with luthier Patrick James Eggle to rethink the designs and reintroduce the Shergold name.", "The comeback kid of guitar brands, Washburn's first blaze of glory was in the late 19th century when George W. Lyon (the W stood for Washburn) and Patrick J. Healy were making instruments for the U.S. music publisher Ditson. By 1880, they were making Washburn-brand instruments, which are today highly sought-after.", "In 1912, it was Washburn who introduced the first dreadnought-size acoustic guitar, although they didn't actually call it a dreadnought—that was down to Martin. Lyon died in 1894, Healy in 1905, and although the business continued after their deaths, guitar making diminished in importance. In 1928, the Washburn name was sold to a distributor, and by the '40s it had ceased altogether.", 'Enter, over 100 years later, Rudy Schlacher, a German repairman working in the United States, who saw the potential in a revived vintage brand. He spotted that the Washburn name had been acquired and applied to a range of Japanese-made acoustics by a California company, and in partnership with Rick Johnstone he acquired the name in 1977.', "With some help along the way from Roland's founder Ikutaro Kakehashi, Washburn quickly re-established itself by selling Japanese-made instruments, both acoustic and electric.", 'In 2009, the Washburn International company was sold to the Canadian firm Jam Industries, which itself was sold to an Irish company in September 2018. Washburns from the first incarnation—there is no connection between the two, other than an acquired name—can be very valuable, but modern Washburns have their collectors, too.', "There aren't many guitar companies that can claim Elvis as a user, but the Swedish-made Hagstrom brand can. They can also claim Jimi Hendrix, as he famously used their eight-string bass on Axis: Bold As Love. Add Kurt Cobain, David Bowie, Joe Walsh, and Frank Zappa, and it's clear that Hagstrom had something going for it.", "The firm was founded in Sweden in the '30s to build accordions, and Hagstrom added guitars and amps in the '50s. During the '60s, Hagstrom made cheap models sold in the U.S. as Kent (not to be confused with the other Kent brand) and in the UK as Futurama, and these provided starting-out instruments for many players. But it was the Swede and the Viking models that really did the business for the company. Hagstrom even made the world's first guitar synthesizer, the Swede Patch 2000. It was launched in 1976 and was way ahead of its time, and it failed to make an impact.", 'Hagstrom production ceased in 1983, when cheap imports overtook the company. The name languished until 2004, when it was revived, mostly for imports, although some models are still manufactured in Europe.', "Germany's Framus brand may have a history that only stretches back to 1946, but from its inception it inherited a legacy of serious craftsmanship. It was the brainchild of Fred A. Wilfer, who wanted to provide employment for German musical instrument makers who were resettled in Bavaria after World War II. Framus quickly established itself with a reputation for quality instruments, and by the late '60s it could claim to be Europe's largest guitar maker.", "On offer by Framus was everything from basses (famously used by Rolling Stone Bill Wyman in the band's early days) through archtops, steel-string acoustics, and solidbody electrics. Worthy though they were, they lacked the glamour and glitz of American instruments, and the company fell prey to Japanese imports, collapsing into bankruptcy at the end of the '70s.", "The brand's rebirth came about in 1995 when Wilfer's son, Hans-Peter, revived the name. Hans-Peter had already established his own successful instrument venture, Warwick. Notable Framus users today include Earl Slick and Devin Townsend.", "There are plenty of other brands that have come back from the dead—perhaps you can remind us of some of them? But here are a few that haven't and yet still could.", "Once the USA's largest guitar producer, the brand appeared mostly on beginners' instruments. But some Harmony models, both electric and acoustic, have become sought-after collector's items. A Harmony Sovereign acoustic can be heard on Led Zeppelin's 'Stairway To Heaven.' In late 2017, BandLab announced plans to revive the brand and had prototypes on hand at the Winter and Summer NAMM in 2018. While the guitars were expected to be available for purchase this summer, they've yet to appear. Harmony's full return remains to be seen.", "Update, 6/26/2019: They're alive. The three new Harmony models—the Silhouette, Rebel, and Jupiter—are now available for pre-order through Reverb.", "Sub-Fender designs, maybe, but the UK's Watkins guitars were immensely popular in the '60s. Made by Sid and Reg Watkins, brothers of the amp and PA pioneer Charlie Watkins, the Watkins guitars were affordable when Strats were not. They have considerable nostalgia value.", "At one point in the '80s, the American brand Kramer claimed to have overtaken Fender in the number of guitars it produced. Spun out of Travis Bean in the '70s, it eventually abandoned the aluminum necks it started with and became the shred guitar brand of the era, particularly when used by Eddie Van Halen. Eventually acquired by Gibson, the brand has languished in recent years—even if it isn't technically dead.", "Like Kramer, this brand is not actually in possession of a death certificate. Hamer was once hugely successful with a slew of name endorsers, including Kiss, Wishbone Ash, Judas Priest, Bad Company, and Cheap Trick's Rick Nielsen. Hamer was big news in the '70s and '80s—it made fine guitars, and it was very well respected. Eventually the business was sold to Kaman (which also owned Ovation), and Hamer later fell victim to Fender, which purchased the Kaman company in 2007.", "In 2013, Fender announced no more Hamers, but the name passed to KMC, ultimately owned by the Canadian firm Jam Industries (see Washburn, above), which has made some efforts to revive it. Jam, however, was recently sold to yet another company, so Hamer's future seems, once again, uncertain.", 'About the Author: Gary Cooper is a journalist working in the musical instrument and pro audio fields.

Cliff was the bass player in The Millionaires—they made a single on Decca in 1966, "Wishing Well / Chatterbox," produced by Joe Meek—and his idea was to build a recording studio in the basement.', '"It took a long time to build the studio," Cliff says with a smile, reminiscing in his office at the Orange Amps HQ in Hertfordshire. "Then, when we eventually finished it, we didn\'t have the customers. And of course I was running short of money. So we took the whitewash off the windows, and I put all my Vox equipment into the shop. It sold the first day."', 'As luck would have it, the shop was in a great position. "I didn\'t realise it at first, but it was on \'the walkaround,\'" Cliff says. "People used to walk along from Tottenham Court Road to Charing Cross Road, up to Shaftesbury Avenue, turn right, and then you had Sound City, Francis Day & Hunter, loads of music shops. And we were right in the middle of that walkaround. It was just luck, really. So when my Vox gear sold so quickly, we started buying secondhand equipment and putting it in the shop, and that, too, began to do well."', "Not only did Cliff get rid of the whitewash, he painted the outside of the shop orange. It's become, to say the least, an important colour for him.", 'He laughs at the memory. "Yes, that luminous orange! It got us in trouble with the local council, you know? You have to remember, back in those days, nearly all the cars, for example, were black. And our shop was a dirty brown colour. Why orange? Well, it was my favourite colour. Simple as that, yes. And I like oranges, as well. It was very much the hippie days, and we painted the name above the shop in a very hippie-ish style, all different colours, and we still use that logo today, it\'s remained the way we write Orange."', 'Sales of secondhand gear were booming, and the Orange shop soon became a likely place to stop by and check out old guitars and amps. John Bates, who managed the shop for Cliff, told me some years ago: "We were the first vintage guitar shop in England, really. Every famous guitarist in the country, from Hendrix down to The Who, bought their guitars from me. They didn\'t buy them in America—well, some did—but most bought them from me. At any one time we used to have 15 Les Paul Standards in Orange—it was quite famous for that."', 'Another factor that made Orange different at the time was the vibe of the place. "The other shops mainly had suited salesmen with ties, mainly middle-aged men," Cliff remembers, "but with our shop, it was long hair and hippie clothes. We found Paul Kossoff, Marc Bolan, Gary Moore, John Lennon would come in. They\'d just sit around playing all day long. We didn\'t kick them out. It became a very in place to be."', 'One of the shop\'s key sources for used gear was a weekly advertising paper called Exchange & Mart, which any musician from that time will remember as the place to buy and sell instruments and equipment. "Bands didn\'t like brand new guitars, they liked beat up guitars," Cliff recalls. "A brand new guitar didn\'t look right, you know?" Which was just as well, because Orange found they couldn\'t acquire new gear. It seemed the regular industry channels were closed off to newcomers.', '"That was a problem," Cliff explains. "None of the major brands—Marshall, Fender, Gibson, anyone—would supply us. We just couldn\'t get new equipment."', 'The problem would lead Cliff to a masterstroke that would change his life—though it didn\'t seem like that at the time. "It made us design and build our own amps. We got them made with a company called Matamp, up in Huddersfield, run by Mat Matthias. He built the amps for us up there and we fiddled around with the circuitry a bit to get it right. The first band to use them was Fleetwood Mac: they bought a whole set of equipment.', '"Peter Green was a brilliant guitarist. He\'d come in the shop, and we were very friendly. They recorded \'Albatross,\' and they went to America and took our equipment with them, so that really launched us in America. The other thing that really helped was Stevie Wonder. He bought a set of our equipment and recorded \'Superstition\' on Orange, and that went round the world."', "In the early '70s, Cliff decided the time was right for Orange to manufacture its own amps. He shifted production from Matamp in the north of England briefly to Short's Gardens, not far from the shop, and then to a factory site in Bexleyheath, a suburb to the south-east of London. He chanced on the premises while visiting James How's Rotosound string-making factory a little further up the same road.", '"Mat carried on making his own amp, the Matamp. But when we moved on, we developed what we called the Orange plexiglass amplifier." The classic Orange graphic amp? "That\'s right. That was designed by a guy called John James, and I was more involved with the visuals of the thing."', 'Ah yes, the visuals. The GRO100 Graphic Overdrive amp and associated models were finished in orange, of course, but they had a startling new look to the front panel. Instead of knobs with just "Volume" and "Tone" and all the rest, there also were icons to indicate the various functions. Cliff says this came from his notion to always do things differently and not copy anybody.', '"I had the idea for these hieroglyphics. We were exporting amplifiers now, and in a lot of countries people didn\'t know what \'volume\' meant in English. I thought these symbols were a great idea, because hieroglyphics were just coming in with the new road signs. That\'s where I got the idea from really, and we transferred that idea to the graphic amplifiers." (Starting in 1964, British road signs had been redesigned with simple, bold icons to warn of things like roadworks or a school ahead.)', 'The graphic amps also had a fabulously over-the-top Voice Of The World crest.', '"I loved the idea of crests," Cliff says, laughing. "It was almost heraldic." I ask him about a \'70s Orange catalogue that describes the figure of Pan on the crest as the "god of nature and hypnotic music." He laughs some more at this. "I wonder where that came from! Anyway, we\'ve certainly got Pan on the left, and then Britannia on the other side. Everything on the crest has a meaning.', '"The sun and moon—that means we work day and night. The scales are for justice: We\'re fair. The sea: We work abroad, overseas. The orange tree is the orange grasping the world. Then you have musical symbols for an increase or decrease in volume, a lion for strength, and there\'s a hammer and chisel for the craftsmen, our craft." And the barrel, Mr Cooper? "That was for plenty. And—well, a cooper is a barrel maker, I think. Somebody suggested that to me. It was tongue-in-cheek, that one, but it\'s known as a barrel of plenty."', 'This different look would have been for nothing if the sound of Orange\'s amps didn\'t appeal to musicians, of course. The amps and cabs were quality items, with a big, detailed sound that plenty of players were happy to hear behind them. Marshall was the main competition. "Their amps had more of a distortion, and a distorted amplifier will always sound louder than a clean amplifier," Cliff says.', '"We found that the Marshall 100-watt, when we tested it, was only 92 watts, where our 100-watt was 120—but the Marshall sounded much louder. We found out that when distortion appears as pain on the ears they read it and reject that distorted sound. It\'s almost like throwing a pebble in a river. You chuck a lump of concrete in, and it\'s all rough. But you throw a pebble in, and you get nice clean ripples. It\'s like that when sound hits the eardrum. So we had to make our amplifiers a bit more distorted."', "Cliff remembers many discussions with his amp designer, John James, about making Orange sound different, but still with that rock'n'roll edge.", '"The original Marshalls—I believe there was a mismatch in the output transformer, and so it was distorted. They used an off-the-shelf transformer. And it sounded very loud, which bands wanted. So I suppose, in a way, they got their sound by default," Cooper says. "But to make our amps sound louder, we had to introduce distortion, but we didn\'t introduce it in the output stage. We introduced it at the input stage. Eventually, by messing around with it, it gave us the Orange sound. We were the alternative, in a way. It wasn\'t the same heavy sound, but nevertheless it was loud and it was different."', "Come the late '70s and into the '80s, Orange's success waned. The shop closed in 1978 when a developer wanted to knock it down. And tastes were changing in the amplifier market. Solid-state amps were the new thing, and to some, valves seemed like the past.", '"I just saw there was no way we could compete," Cliff says with a shrug of his shoulders. "A valve amplifier cost us, in components, four times the cost of a transistor amplifier. There was no way we could compete with that. So we then closed the factory, too."', 'Production was scaled right down to three or four custom amps a week at premises in Islington, north London, and at Masons Yard in the centre of town. Cliff concentrated for a while on his other businesses, including property and artist management.', "Gibson approached Cliff in the early '90s and for a brief period licensed the Orange name. In 1998, Cliff got it back. He had a number of music shops in London's Denmark Street, which had always been a traditional spot for instrument shops and other music-biz locations, and he kept up to date with what musicians were buying.", '"I began thinking about building the amps again. There was a chap came to work for me called Adrian Emsley. He used to be a motorcycle messenger, but he loved amplifiers. He would do repairs for us. So he helped when we started designing a new range. And it was lucky, because the first amp we designed—Noel Gallagher of Oasis came into the shop, because he used Orange to record his first two albums. He came looking for Orange amps. We introduced him to Adrian, and between us we came out with a design he wanted. We shaped it to the sound Noel wanted. He bought it and used it on television. That launched us again! It was pure luck, really."', "Orange's second coming was under way. New models such as the Rockerverbs and the AD30—a none-too-subtle reference to a certain Vox amp—put the fruits of the revived operation in front of the eyes and ears of a new generation of musicians, who liked the vibe and the sound. Around 2008, the company established distribution in the U.S., today centred in Atlanta, and more recently Orange has expanded its reach into China, at first manufacturing its Crush series of practice amps there.", '"It wasn\'t easy," Cliff says of the Chinese experience. "There\'s a lot of red tape. But we\'ve got Chinese people and South Korean people working for us, and they helped a lot. We have two factories in Jiashan now. We couldn\'t have done it without Chinese-speaking people. And then we had the Tiny Terror, the first lunchbox amp, which was an enormous success. We sold tens of thousands of those. \'Course, everybody copied us with the lunchbox amps, and they still do. We stopped the Tiny Terror two or three years ago, but we\'re going to reintroduce it with improved circuitry and so on."', 'When Cliff was whitewashing those shop windows in September 1968, could he have imagined that one day he\'d be in charge of a worldwide amplifier business? "Absolutely not! Looking back on these 50 years, I\'m absolutely amazed. I\'ll be 76 this year, and I still love the business, I love the music, and I\'ll work to the day I can\'t, hopefully. It keeps you going."', 'About the Author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music. He is a co-founder of Backbeat UK and Jawbone Press.

(It\'s a treatment we\'ve previously given to guitars.) Today, we\'re turning our attention to six synthesizers we\'d love to see faithfully remade today.', 'Reissues are common in the world of guitars and other instruments, so why not synthesizers? Perhaps it\'s because for most of its young life, the synthesizer has been seen as a technological marvel as much as an instrument. From modular to hard-wired portable units, monophony to polyphony, analog to digital, the key word for synths has always been progress. Reissues, however, are the antithesis of progress. They\'re nostalgic and traditional, meant to recall a bygone era when things were "better."', "Now that we've come full circle back to analog being a force in the synthesizer market, it was inevitable that manufacturers would take a page from the book of guitars and reissue some of their classic gear. Moog has done it with its venerable Minimoog, and Korg has had a hit not only with its MS-20 Mini but with a surprise reissue of ARP's Odyssey.", "Reissues make sense not only to satisfy the market but, by taking advantage of modern manufacturing processes, manufacturers can address their original instruments' shortcomings and solve the problem of diminishing parts, as well as add features like MIDI and USB.", "Here are six synthesizers that we think are in need of a reissue. We are ignoring clones and digital remixes like the Roland Boutique and Yamaha Reface lines for this piece, as that's a different idea. For our picks below, we'd love to see exacting reissues. It was difficult to whittle it down to just these six, so we have likely left off some you'd like to see. If so, please let us know in the comments.", "Released in 1981, the Jupiter-8 was Roland's flagship synthesizer and the culmination of a decade's worth of innovation. In an atypical act of hubris, Roland named their synth after the Roman king of the gods, and the Jupiter-8 did indeed sit at the top of the polyphonic pantheon of the time. It became the sound of the second wave of synth pop, making its way onto records by Duran Duran and Erasure. Howard Jones liked it so much he put it on the cover of his record.", "The Jupiter-8 is an extremely flexible synth, able to do everything from cross mod to sync to unison (16 voices!), with a switchable 12dB and 24dB low-pass filter adding to the variety. It can handle pretty much whatever you need and do it in a reliable and workmanlike way. Of course, none of this would matter if it didn't sound like heaven. Unlike the American polys of the day, which were through taking your guff, the Jupiter-8 was shiny and clear, and politely excused itself into your mix, doing its best to make your song sound great.", "Roland has gotten plenty of mileage out of the Jupiter name over the years, relying on the pedigree without ever achieving the glory of the original synth. The Boutique Series JP-08 only whetted our appetites. Isn't it about time it gave its customers what they've been asking for?", 'Korg had a hit on its hands with the reissue of the ARP Odyssey, so why not make lightning strike twice with the 2600, the big brother of the Odyssey—and one of the most iconic synths ever?', "Straddling the worlds of modular and portable, the 2600 is a semi-modular, fully normalled synthesizer capable of just about anything you can imagine. Both musically competent and a sound designer's dream, the 2600 has been used by everyone from Edgar Winter, who wore the detachable keyboard around his shoulder like a guitar, to Orbital, to Ben Burtt, who used it to create the distinctive voice of R2-D2.", "Much like the Odyssey, there were a number of production colors and revisions of the 2600 in its 10 years of production, so we'd love to see Korg issue different versions of the main colors (blue, gray, and black), with a switch for the different filter types. A new generation of synthesists is waiting.", "Moog has certainly proved it can make a good monosynth. And while there are plenty of classic monos we'd love to see resurrected (hello, Source) what Moog really needs to do is give us a poly. Sure, a brand-new synth like the Moog One is nice, but a reissue of the Memorymoog would be the bee's knees.", 'Originally released in 1981, the Memorymoog was the equivalent of six Minimoogs strapped together. With three oscillators per voice and six-voice polyphony, that added up to a whopping 18 oscillators per voice, best heard on its mind-blowingly gargantuan unison mode. Additionally, it had freely mixable waveforms and that famous ladder filter. It was the Cadillac of synths. Hell, the Cadillac is the Memorymoog of cars.', "It wasn't without its problems though, particularly in terms of its autotune function, and some complained that it dominated any mix it bullied its way into. A reissue with modern components would certainly take care of any tuning issues, and as for being too big and bold, well, that's a problem we'd all be willing to tackle.", 'Korg has always been something of a rebel, willing to take risks when its competitors are reluctant to stray too far from the middle of the road. The Mono/Poly was one such risk, a synthesizer that encouraged experimentation and still remains unique to this day.', "Released in 1981 as a complement to the more straight-ahead Polysix, the Mono/Poly does what it claims to: It can be both a four-oscillator monosynth or a four-voice polysynth. Like the Oberheim Four Voice, it's essentially four separate VCOs in one box, each with its own tuning, volume, and waveform settings. They can be tuned together or apart for big unison sounds or poly chords.", "This alone would be enough to make it stand out, but the engineers at Korg were good enough to include a bumper crop of cross mod and sync options, as well as one of the coolest arpeggiators in all of synthdom, capable of cycling through each oscillator individually. This kind of analog fun really deserves to live again. Korg, we're begging you.", "In the mid-'80s, synth manufacturers were searching for the next big hit. Yamaha was wringing everything it could out of FM, while others were trying to figure out how to incorporate digital into their existing architectures. Enter Ensoniq, an American company founded by the inventor of the Commodore 64 SID chip.", 'The ESQ-1 was a hybrid. It used digital samples of waveforms as oscillators that were then put through analog filters and amplifiers. The result was a synth that could do clean and pristine like a DX7 but also hold its own next to analog gear thanks to its inclusion of analog waveforms. The waveforms may have only been 8-bit but this rough plus smooth combination yielded some quite unique timbres, and with three oscillators per voice, it did it with style. Its multitimbrality, sequencer, velocity-sensitive keyboard, and affordable price-point helped make it a success.', "Ensoniq is no more, but the ESQ-1 deserves another chance. What with the recent release of Sequential Circuits' own hybrid Prophet X, perhaps Dave Smith would like to partner with Ensoniq's founders and reissue the ESQ-1? Assuming they keep the waveforms 8-bit, they could even include a Mirage sampling option. Here, we'll even book the conference room for the meeting. Dave, you know it makes sense.", "Very few synths scream rock star like the Oberheim OB-Xa. The list of players is a who's who of '80s pop royalty, from Prince to Van Halen to, well, everybody. Even techno heroes Underground Resistance named a song after it. The Matrix-12 may have had all the options but the OB-Xa is the stuff that pop star caviar dreams are made of.", 'First released in 1980 and available in 4-, 6-, and 8-voice configurations, the OB-Xa was big and bold, with its black chassis and blue pin-stripe detailing. Its Curtis chips solved a number of problems its predecessor, the OB-X, had with discrete circuitry—without losing its power to cut through a mix. It had a great unison mode, and with the ability to individually pan each voice, to call the sound huge was an understatement. It was something akin to a tunable swarm of bees.', 'Tom Oberheim recently had success with his OB-6, released with the help of his friend Dave Smith and Sequential Circuits, so they really should pair up again to get this Star Destroyer of a synth back on the market. Might as well jump, right?', "Lastly, some of you may be surprised that the venerable EMS Synthi isn't on this list. That's because both the VCS3 and A units are still being manufactured by EMS. The website might be out of date, but the British company is still taking orders.", 'About the Author: Adam Douglas is a musician and synthesizer fan based in Tokyo, Japan.

In fact, this is a common misconception among guitarists, owing at least in part to the term "mini-humbucker," which itself suggests that size is the single defining aspect of this pickup\'s personality. This obscures the truth of the matter, however, which is best learned with one\'s ears.', 'Without question, the best real-world demonstration of the distinct sonic differences between humbuckers and mini-humbuckers is the legendary 1978 Thin Lizzy live document, Live and Dangerous. This rock-n-roll classic captures Phil Lynott and company at the height of their powers, while incidentally serving as a perfect reference for comparing the tone of a PAF-equipped Gibson Les Paul Standard with the tone of its mini-equipped younger sibling, the Les Paul Deluxe.', 'Drop the needle on the album\'s first track, "Jailbreak," and you will hear Thin Lizzy guitarists Scott Gorham (panned right in the mix) and Brian Robertson (panned left) tearing through the song\'s monstrous opening riff. It is immediately clear that Gorham\'s LP Deluxe sounds noticeably brighter overall than Robertson\'s Standard, which exhibits the heavy, muscular grunt we commonly associate with a Les Paul through a cranked Marshall.', "In stark contrast, Gorham's sound is almost single-coil like, with less bass content and rich, highly saturated treble and mid-range frequencies. Together these contrasting tones create one of the most compelling and dynamic dual-guitar attacks in hard rock history.", 'So what accounts for this difference in tone? Well, as it turns out, size really is important when it comes to magnetic pickups. The mini-humbucker has almost everything in common with its iconic Seth Lover-designed counterpart, the PAF, except for size. Because of its smaller physical area though, there are major implications for tone: The mini picks up a shorter length of the vibrating guitar string, which directly correlates to less overall low-end content, slightly lower output, and a clearer tone with an abundance of high-end sparkle.', "The mini also has lower iron content in its core (due to its size), which further contributes to these characteristics. Fans of this somewhat underutilized transducer love it for its clarity and jangle, as well as its tendency to retain string definition even under the heaviest distortion. A good mini will also grind and sing like nobody's business when pushed hard.", 'As previously mentioned, the basic construction of a mini-humbucker is essentially the same as a regular humbucker, only miniaturized. Each coil has a bar magnet underneath of it, with the familiar adjustable pole pieces that most of us would recognize from a PAF-style pickup, each made of a magnetic, iron-based alloy (the technical term for this kind of metal alloy is "ferrous").', 'The other coil in the pickup also contains a similar ferrous bar magnet, but without the adjustable pole pieces. The only difference in a standard PAF-style design is that, rather than a second, non-adjustable bar magnet, there are typically several metal slugs arranged in series.', 'Unbeknownst to many, the mini-humbucker design originated with Epiphone, with Gibson acquiring the rights and technology when its parent company, CMI, purchased Epiphone in 1957.', "The mini-humbucker was the stock pickup of the original Epiphone Sheraton model. This feature set the Sheraton apart from Gibson's ES-335, which was spec'd with full-size humbuckers, as both guitars were developed concurrently in a joint Gibson/Epiphone project.", 'The mini-humbucker first became widely known to rock guitarists in 1968, when Gibson introduced it as the stock pickup of the new Les Paul Deluxe model. Interestingly, the only reason it was featured in the LP Deluxe was because Gibson had an overabundance of minis left over from Epiphone stock, and needed to find a use for them. The solution was to install them in Les Paul bodies that had originally been routed out for P90s, filling in the resulting gap with a specially made adapter ring.', "When first introduced, and throughout the original run of the Les Paul Deluxe, the mini-humbucker was considered inferior to Gibson's full-sized humbucker. In fact, Thin Lizzy's Gorham, one of the pickup's most celebrated users, only ended up with a mini-equipped Deluxe because the band did not have the budget to purchase a more expensive PAF-loaded Les Paul Standard.", "In modern times the mini-humbucker has steadily gained respect, as well as a strong cult following among guitarists with a taste for less common tonal flavors. High-profile players like Gorham and Pete Townshend have cemented its legacy as a legitimate tone tool and an iconic pickup design. (Meanwhile, the different mini-humbuckers found in Firebirds were famously used by the likes of Johnny Winter. And a particularly hot Firebird mini-humbucker holds a revered spot in the bridge position of Neil Young's main Les Paul.) It has also experienced something of a renaissance as part of the boutique pickup boom of the last decade.", 'Celebrated custom winders like Jason Lollar, Lindy Fralin, and Curtis Novak have done much to elevate its profile in recent years, while bigger mainstream builders like Seymour Duncan and Dimarzio also offer several stock models. Budget parts suppliers like Guitarfetish also produce some great low-dough mini-humbucker models in several interesting variations. The legacy of the mini-humbucker is stronger than ever, ensuring that these pickups and the guitars designed around them will be with us for a long time.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Witnessing the success of several smaller independent makers, big manufacturers like Fender, Vox, and Marshall soon caught on to roll out legitimate reissues of their own.", 'Many other outstanding makes and models have thus far evaded the rebirth they richly deserve, however. Though their original incarnations won fans and cult followings, they remain unavailable to the larger guitar-playing public.', "Let's take a look at seven guitar amps deserving of thoughtful reissues.", 'Gibson’s amp designers of the ’50s and ’60s purportedly took pride in avoiding copying any of the models from popular California upstart Fender… until it became just too obvious that was the sound that so many players demanded. The model GA-70 combo is often regarded as the first creation out of Kalamazoo to aim directly at the Fender sound. While redesigned after the first run in \'56, the \'57-\'58 GA-70 "Country Western" had a circuit and speaker complement that are broadly similar to the narrow-panel Pro Amp of that era. As a result, guitarists in the know have long acclaimed them as the best-sounding models of Gibson’s entire vintage range.', 'The 1x15" combo put out about 30 watts courtesy of a pair of 5881 output tubes (similar to 6L6s). Unlike most Gibsons of the day, these were fixed-bias rather than cathode-biased, meaning the amp was a little tighter and had more headroom, with a firmer bass response too. The inputs for Microphone and Instrument linked to channels that were, in fact, identical, and from there they shared controls for Bass, Treble, and Fidelity.', 'The latter three lead us to the GA-70\'s other claim to fame: that it was the inspiration for Vox\'s Top Boost EQ stage. The Bass and Treble controls, in fact, governed the same cathode-follower tone stage already found in larger Fender tweed combos post-\'55, while the Fidelity control was the same thing as the Presence control found on rival amps… only wired backwards. Vox\'s incorporation of the backwards potentiometer wiring (yielding a control they instead called "Hi Cut") and adherence to another anomaly in the Gibson schematic does seem to point to the GA-70 as the Brits\' inspiration, though.', 'Specs aside, the GA-70 is a great-sounding amp with a big, bold tone that breaks up sweetly without getting too loud, and a lot of dynamic touch sensitivity for blues, country, jazz, or garage rock, or plenty of other genres besides.', 'Other makers have offered re-creations of other versions of the tweed Tremolux, and Fender itself has even delivered the (now deleted) EC Tremolux, but that rendition of the first iteration of the Tremolux design—as did these others—represented a genuine missing-of-the-boat, in my opinion.', "The debutante 5E9 Tremolux of '55 and the 5E9-A that followed were essentially 5E3 Deluxes with tremolo added. And while that might seem a great thing—and perhaps is, in its own right—the tweed Tremolux really came into its own with the totally revamped 5G9 circuit of '57/'58. At this point, the Tremolux became a bigger amp—literally—and a glorious new model unto itself, in so many ways.", 'Even fans of the legendary tweed Deluxe have often complained that it could do with a little more headroom, a less "boxy" sound, and a bigger and tighter sound overall. The Tremolux managed all of these tricks, with a great output-bias-modulated tremolo added in besides. How did it do that? It was essentially built like a stripped-down tweed Bassman in a 1x12" cab… with 6V6s… and tremolo.', "Instead of being cathode-biased like the Deluxe, the Tremolux was fixed bias, making it tighter and bolder-sounding, and it also had a choke in the power filtering, which the Deluxe lacked. And in place of the cathodyne (aka split-load) phase inverter that all of Fender's smaller and medium-sized amps carried, it had a more complex long-tailed-pair inverter, which also helped to make it clearer and less compressed sounding. Even the tweed Super, Pro, Bandmaster, and low-powered Twin didn't have that feature, which only appeared on the Bassman and high-powered Twin.", 'Top it all off with a bigger combo cab (the same size as used by the 1x15" Pro) and a solid 18 watts from two 6V6s, and the late-\'50s Tremolux is a superb-sounding Fender tweed, with enough clarity to twang and chime when you need it, but a sweet, dynamic overdrive when cranked, without bringing the walls down.', "The Mesa/Boogie name is legendary in rock circles, but when you're talking heavy rock and metal tones circa mid-'80s to '90s—think everything from Metallica to Dream Theater—it's just got to be a Mark IIC+.", "The Boogie Mark Series amps tracked a progression in the seminal cascading-gain designs of Randall Smith (with later help from colleagues like Mike Bendinelli), and the amps of the early '70s right through the '80s and into the early '90s progressed from the Mark I to Mark II to Mark III… and so forth, with the Mark V going strong today. Each changed a little along the way, but no Mark Series encompasses such a dramatic evolution as seen in the Mark II amps.", 'The Mark II Series added foot-switchable rhythm and lead channels to the game, but each step along the ladder—from the first (erstwhile A), to the B, to the C, and finally the C+—brought several other alterations to the circuit, most notably to the gain levels and lead voicing. The Mark IIC+ was the fiercest, brightest, and most incendiary of the bunch, and hence the choice of countless fire-breathing shred gods.', "So why hasn't it already been reissued? Boogie fans have certainly hollered from the rooftops for exactly that, yet Smith and co. have explained several salient reasons why it just isn't feasible. The most practical among these seems to be the difficulty in accurately replicating the original transformers—alongside, perhaps, some less-often-vocalized desires to move forward rather than look backward—but hey, c'mon… it's still the most highly acclaimed Boogie in history, so how about one more try at giving the people what they want?", "Canadian amp maker Traynor has previously reissued the YGM-3, and it's a cool and useful combo in and of itself. The earlier YBA-2 Bass Mate, however, is a different beast entirely, and is arguably more highly acclaimed as a little sleeper of a tone machine… for guitar.", "Later versions of the Bass Mate and Guitar Mate heads and combos moved on to fixed-bias EL84 output tubes, giving them an interesting blend of British-meets-(North) American voices. The mid-'60s Bass Mate YBA-2, on the other hand, packed a pair of resolutely American-sounding 6V6GT output tubes, which were run in cathode-bias, no less, like the legendary tweed Deluxe, for one.", "What's the difference? Cathode biasing makes the amp just a little juicier-sounding and more saturated with harmonic overtones when pushed hard, while the 6V6GTs retain a certain chunky, gritty voice that screams rock'n'roll. These amps aren't much count for bass unless you're keeping them pretty low, but cranked up for guitar they make surprisingly gutsy little tone machines.", 'Controls included just Volume and Tone, but other nifty and generally unseen bonus features were found inside the chassis, where the Bass Mate circuit employed the same lustworthy Mullard/Phillips "mustard caps" found in vintage Marshalls, along with high-quality Hammond transformers. Also, the Bass Mate was just so compact, cute, and cuddly that the head configuration in particular has a certain irresistible grab\'n\'go appeal.', 'Speaking of cute and cuddly, the original Vox AC10 of the early \'60s might have even more of an "aww" factor than its older sibling, the AC15.', 'Vox delivered the AC10 Custom in 2015, and has long had an AC15 available in several iterations (which should be "five better" than an AC10, right?), and yet none of this gets close to the nifty je ne sais quois or unbridled cuteness of the original JMI-made AC10. The earliest version came out in a 1x10" combo (about the only thing it has in common with Vox\'s current AC10C1), but guitarists know it best, and have seen it most, in the tasteful 2x10" version, aka the AC10 Twin—and if it\'s in fawn Rexine, so much the better.', 'One key to the AC10 tone is its beefy, fat-sounding EF86 pentode preamp tube, the same used in the original AC15 and the very earliest renditions of the AC30. You really can\'t replicate anything close to the original AC10 tone without that tube. Otherwise, it\'s 10 watts of droolworthy cathode-biased-EL84-with-no-negative-feedback goodness (colloquially "Class A") into a pair of crisp, toothsome 10" Goodmans alnico speakers.', "Lush tremolo came courtesy of an odd ECF82 tube that housed triode and pentode gain stages in a single bottle—a quirky, rare, and potentially microphonic tube at that, so we'd forgive Vox for reconfiguring the tremolo and second channel preamp stage via different tubes for our desired reissue.", 'Perfect for studio and small club use, and able to hit that delectable and uniquely Vox transition point from clean into mean, this is an amp that really could use a thoughtful Hand-Wired redux.', 'Vintage-amp write-ups are more likely to focus on the wedge-shaped 2x10" Watkins Dominator of the late \'50s and early \'60s, but its 1x12" descendant of the \'70s is arguably a fiercer Brit-rock performer, if a less conspicuous one. (Founder Charlie Watkins changed the brand name from his own surname to the initials WEM in \'63 or \'64 after noting the appeal, and success, of the similarly styled VOX logo.)', "The combo's design, electronically speaking, is something of a splicing of a Fender blackface preamp stage and a Vox AC15 or Marshall 18-watter output stage with two cathode-biased EL84s. The former allows both Bass and Treble controls for each of two channels, with their EQ circuits sandwiched between the two gain stages from an ECC83 preamp tube each (aka 12AX7). The latter means a sweet and easy segue from clean to clipping, and a juicy, raw, rocktastic bundle of fun when you push it hard.", 'Aside from all of that, these things just sound like your archetypal vintage British rock machine (Marshall, Vox, etc.) when cranked and roaring, and even more so when loaded with the stock Celestion Greenback 12" that many of them carried.', 'Don\'t shun the WEM Dominator Mk I Bass model either. The circuit is the same as the Mk III guitar model, but the combo carries a 15" speaker instead of a 12", which was often a rarely-seen—yet glorious sounding—big Celestion Greenback.', 'Faux croc. Blinking "magic eye." That\'s about all you need to know right there. The mid-\'60s Zodiac Twin 30 is one of the coolest guitar amps to come out of Britain in the golden age of tube amps—or, heck, out of anywhere—and is well overdue for a reissue.', "Selmer, long a big name in wind instruments, was one of the first makers to get into the guitar amp game in Britain, starting in the mid-'30s, and arguably remained the biggest player in the market right up until the late '50s. Given the early-adopter and erstwhile top-dog status, Selmer's designs were very much their own, and while they touch upon themes we've seen in other better-known British makers, their amp models were really something unto themselves.", 'Each of two channels had Volume and Tone, but Ch2 also had a whacky six-button SelectorTone control (kind of a push-button VariTone), as well as tremolo… which, yes, triggered the front-panel "eye" to wink in time with its pulse.', 'The Zodiac Twin 30 generated around 30 watts from a pair of cathode-biased EL34 output tubes (the same as used in a Marshall Plexi, but configured differently), while the preamp stages in each of its two channels had an ECC83 (aka 12AX7) feeding into an EF86 pentode preamp tube, as found in the Vox AC15. A pair of Celestion G12 Alnico speakers took it all home.', 'No wonder nothing else sounds quite like this amp, noted for its thick, rich, warm tone and beefy overdrive when pushed hard. And with its silver-hued mock-crocodile covering and silver-threaded black grille cloth, nothing else looks remotely like one, either.', "Do you have a favorite amp you'd love to see reissued?

machines featured in this video come from the private collection of Moby.", "These days, if you turn on the radio to a local pop station or fire up a Top 40 playlist on a streaming platform, you're going to hear music built on electronic rhythms. Sequenced and loop-based production has become the dominant form of pop music production, and while most of today's chart-toppers are created with software on a laptop, the sounds and the compositional process find origin in a technology with a much longer lineage: the drum machine.", 'The earliest contraption that we could label as a drum machine came about in the 1930s in the form of the Rhythmicon. Commissioned by American composer Henry Cowell and designed by the mysterious Leon Theremin, the Rhythmicon could play multiple rhythms or polyrhythms at once, echoing the modernist serialism of composers like Arnold Schoenberg.', "The Rhythmicon didn't sound especially good and was really more of an experiment than a marketable product. And while it established the concept of a device that could play ongoing loops of rhythms, it would be another 20 years before the next major drum machine milestone.", "In the late '50s, the Chamberlin Rhythmate and Wurlitzer Sideman both offered ways to trigger preset drum parts designed to accompany an organist or a family singalong. The Chamberlin played back recorded drum parts on actual audio tape, much like a Chamberlin or Mellotron keyboard. The Sideman generated sounds via mechanical inner-workings like a big music box.", "These were large machines that sat on the floor and offered limited—if groundbreaking—functionality. The Sideman's rhythms included such styles as the Cha Cha, Waltz, and Bolera in a format that would be carried on in the next generation of drum machine design.", 'Moving into the 1960s, the basic preset formula established by the Sideman would be adopted and expanded by more and more instrument makers that would integrate new electronic components into their designs.', 'Solid-state transistors specifically allowed drum machines to shrink in size, starting with the Thomas Band Master Model 55. In Japan, new companies like Keio-Giken (later known as Korg) and Ace Tone (the predecessor to Roland) would build an entire industry of devices designed as accessories for the organs of companies like Hammond in the United States.', "Ace Tone and Roland founder Ikutaro Kakehashi loved music, and with a background working with watches and clocks, it's easy to understand how the young engineer would develop an interest in this new type of timekeeping device.", "But breakthrough drum machine tech wasn't an exclusively Japanese enterprise—tons of other companies would enter the drum machine market in this era, building their own takes on the basic, preset rhythm box format.", 'The Elka Drummer One, with its individual volume controls over each drum sound, was made in Italy and became a favorite of Krautrock iconoclasts like Cluster and Kraftwerk. The Maestro Rhythm King MRK-2 was famously used by Sly Stone and can be heard all over 1971\'s classic There\'s a Riot Goin\' On. This record included the number one hit, "Family Affair"—the first chart-topper to include a drum machine track.', 'Yet while machines like the Rhythm King and Drummer One were starting to find their way onto the recordings of experimental and pop-oriented artists alike, the functionality was still limited. For as much creative energy as Sly Stone was able to wring out of the Rhythm King, it was still a basic metronome-like device that was restricted to old-school patterns like like Fox Trot and Samba.', 'For musicians to be able to make the next creative leap with how drum machines functioned and shed their perception as tacky boxes for church organists, there would need to be a new level of control.', 'This occured with the rise of what we now call "programmable drum machines."', "The concept of programmability in the context of a drum machine refers to the ability of players to create their own patterns out of the sounds found inside of the box. Programmable drum machines came about first in 1972 when the Eko ComputeRhythm was released with a basic beat matrix, a format that's been included on most drum machines ever since. A kit electronic company called PAiA also distributed a programmable drum machine in 1975, which some consider the first true example.", "In 1978, Roland released the CR-78 CompuRhythm, the first drum machine to include a microprocessor. While not Roland's first attempt at programmability, the CR-78 allowed users to save entire sequence—and it was this model that resonated the most with musicians.", 'You can hear it here on Blondie\'s "Heart of Glass" and in Phil Collins\' "In the Air Tonight".', 'Two years later, Roland would strike back with a new machine—a fully programmable device with a unique set of synthesized analog sounds including a booming bass drum and idiosyncratic cowbell, handclaps, and claves. The TR-808, as it was dubbed, remains, without question, the most important drum machine of all time.', "While not a successful product during its three-year production run, this colorful, iconic box would go on to become an integral component in a myriad of beat-based musical styles. '80s hip-hop innovators like Afrika Bambaataa and the Bomb Squad production team (best-known for their music for Public Enemy) used 808s to expand the sonic palette of the nascent genre. Later, its clap and bass drum sounds would become fundamental ingredients of bounce, crunk, and other forms of Southern hip-hop, which laid the groundwork for much of what you've heard on pop charts from the early 2000s to today.", 'Listen to Usher\'s "Yeah" featuring Lil Jon and Ludacris for a good example of the 808\'s lasting sonic legacy.', "Yet for as unmistakable as the hits and snaps of the 808 remain, no one would argue that its synthesized tones sounded anything like a real acoustic drum set. But in the early '80s, that's what more and more musicians were hoping for—real drum sounds. And to achieve that goal, we need to look to another early '80s bit of tech: the sample-based drum machine.", "The first sample-based drum machine—that is, a drum machine that plays pre-recorded drum sounds instead of synthesized ones—was the Linn Electronics LM-1 designed by one Roger Linn. It relied on then-expensive digital memory, and with a price tag of $5,000 in 1980, was mostly regulated to pro-level studios. Unlike many revolutionary music tech designers, Linn wasn't an engineering wunderkind with a Ph.D. He was a musician. He worked with other musicians, talked to other musicians, and learned how to code and build his instruments from a place of musical necessity.", "Linn thought of his devices as inspirational songwriting tools, not full stand-ins for human drummers. But this conception didn't stop a who's who of '80s producers from giving the sounds of the LM-1 and follow-up LinnDrum a perennial placement in the pop charts. You can hear Prince's LM-1 on many of his biggest hits, and his machine still stands enshrined at Paisley Park.", 'While Linn\'s designs are usually positioned as the key turning point for \'80s drum machines—introducing such drum machine concepts as "quantization" and "swing"—they weren\'t the only new and innovative instruments hitting the market in the \'80s. Most synth manufacturers began to produce their own rhythmic devices as part of their broader product line: the Oberheim DMX, with its swappable memory cards, was a hit with early hip-hop producers. The Sequential Circuits Drumtraks was the first sample-based drum machine with MIDI integration, allowing it to connect to all sorts of other synths and devices. The E-Mu Systems Drumulator offered an even cheaper option for sample-based drums and became a huge seller.', "For Roland's part, the 808 was followed by the hybrid digital-analog TR-909, which similarly failed to sell especially well in its day. Found on the shelves of pawnshops in Detroit and Chicago, though, the 909 would do for techno and house what the 808 did for hip-hop.", 'And throughout this whole period, the programmability of these machines continued to improve. Players could more easily create beats in real time, and these instruments grew increasingly playable. The Linn 9000—the final product offered by Linn Instruments before its demise—introduced a new generation of velocity-sensitive pad controllers to trigger drum sounds, signaling the sort of device that would define the next generation of beat-making tech.', 'Once drum machines like the LinnDrum set a new standard for sound based on the use of pre-recorded samples and open-ended programmability, the next step was to allow users to record and sample their own drum sounds.', "Standalone samplers in a synth context had existed for awhile, and were pioneered by companies like Fairlight and New England Digital. Dave Rossum's E-mu Systems was another earlier popularizer, and followed up the hit Drumulator with the SP-12 and SP-1200 in 1986 and 1987. These machines brought sampling to a drum machine paradigm in a wide-scale way, and remained popular with hip-hop producers for years to come.", 'And then came the MPC.', "Designed by Roger Linn for the Akai company, the MPC is more than a drum machine. It's an integrated, inclusive workstation that allowed a musician to both sample and sequence sounds. It could do the work of a drum machine with the added playability of a set of 16 responsive pad controllers and more.", "There were a number of MPC models produced in the '80s and '90s—starting with the MPC60 and including the MPC3000 favored by the J Dilla and the MPC2000XL favored by Kanye West—which were joined by similar machines from Korg, E-mu, and plenty of other firms. These all laid the groundwork for future beat-making stations such as the Native Instruments Maschine, and would, to a certain degree, predict the entire all-in-one workflow of software DAWs like Fruity Loops (later renamed FL Studio) and Ableton Live.", 'And in many ways, the music production community is still living in this era. While the technology has advanced and the aesthetic standards have evolved, the concept of merging and sequencing different sounds in a totally limitless way remains the defining workflow of modern music production.', "From the MPC and other all-in-one stations onward, it's not so much about drum machines as standalone devices, but more about drum machine sounds and interfaces as part of a complete music-making system. And despite this expansive digital landscape, hardware drum machines remain as popular as ever.", "Today's crop includes decidedly throwback models like the Roland AIRA TR-8, which includes the classics sounds of the 808 and 909. There's the mammoth Dave Smith-Roger Linn collab, the Tempest, and a growing number of pocket-sized units like the Korg Volca Beats or Teenage Engineering Pocket Operators. Elektron in Sweden offers a wide range of imaginative grooveboxes, and a growing list of adventurous boutique makers are pushing the concept in entirely new directions.", "The engineers behind these instruments understand the renewed appeal of tactile, hardware drum machines, and have designed and iterated to meet the evolving needs of modern musicians. It's what drum machine designers have done this entire time, and why these beat-making devices in all their many forms have earned a place at the very center of today's music-making galaxy.", 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

It was almost exactly 60 years ago as you read this that Fender launched the new model. If any other maker had come up with the Jazzmaster, it would be judged on its own merits and shortcomings. But it's a Fender, and so it lives in the shadow of the Strat and Tele. Inevitably, it was seen by some as an also-ran, a guitar that struggled to compete with the versatility of those two iconic models. But it does have a charm and attraction all its own.", 'Fender had been around a little over ten years when it introduced the Jazzmaster toward the end of 1958. The ambitious new company had built a strong solidbody six-string electric line: the original Esquire and Telecaster, the relatively new Stratocaster, and the Duo-Sonic and Musicmaster student models. The Musicmaster was the cheapest, listing at $119.50 USD. The Strat, the most expensive, at $274.50 with vibrato.', "Despite Fender's growing success, Leo Fender, Don Randall, Forrest White, Freddie Tavares, and the rest of the team there must have looked enviously at the market leader, Gibson, whose list of electric models ran from the Les Paul Junior at $120 up to a natural-finish Super 400CES at a dizzying $700. Clearly, there were some players out there who had the money and the inclination to buy expensive electrics. The models at the high-end of Gibson's inventory were luxurious hollowbodys, aimed at and mostly played by top jazz guitarists.", 'Fender\'s team decided to produce a new solidbody instrument to attract these monied musicians. The result was the Fender Jazzmaster, launched at $329.50 as the firm\'s top-of-the-line solidbody. Fender couldn\'t resist calling it "America\'s finest electric guitar… unequaled in performance and design features." Tavares, as usual responsible for some of the design input, said later that the idea was to make something better than the Stratocaster.', "The Jazzmaster had a striking body design, with a waist that had a more exaggerated offset than the Stratocaster's. Fender applied for a utility patent for the offset body early in 1958, granted a couple of years later. The patent was drawn up before the Jazzmaster's features were finalized, and instead it was entirely concerned with what Fender saw as the advantages the design would have for a seated guitarist, underlining the idea that the company believed the model would be taken up by jazzmen and other commonly sedate guitarists.", 'The patent explained that regular bodies have indented "recesses or depressions" for the waist "directly opposite each other." These bodies, according to the patent, cause a seated guitarist "to be relatively uncomfortable during playing, and result in awkwardness and difficulty in achieving the proper and desired plucking or picking positions." The patent claimed the new design, in which the bass-side depression is "between three and six inches nearer" the headstock than the treble-side depression, had "a novel combination of recesses and beveled portions, thereby promoting ease and facility of playing with minimum discomfort to the guitarist." Fender also applied for a simple design patent for the overall look of the Jazzmaster later in \'58, which was granted the following year.', 'There were more Fender firsts on the new Jazzmaster beyond the body shape. It had a separate rosewood fingerboard, glued to the customary maple neck and intended as much as anything to provide a comfortingly conventional appearance and feel for the model\'s targeted audience. The guitar\'s floating vibrato system was new, too, and had a tricky "lock-off" facility designed to prevent tuning problems if a string should break. It was quite different from the earlier integrated Strat vibrato, with the bridge separate from the tailpiece, and was the subject of yet another utility patent, applied for in \'58 and granted early in \'61. It did not succeed nearly as well as the Strat vibrato, though, and without attention the originals can be buzzy beasts.', 'The Jazzmaster had a pair of new pickups, too. They were based on Strat pickups, with six alnico polepieces within the coil, but the coil itself was wider and shallower, in the process generating a smooth, thicker sound—still quite cutting at the bridge but suitably jazzy at the neck. The controls were elaborate for the time, designed so that the player, jazz-inclined or otherwise, could set up a rhythm sound and a lead sound, and then flick a small slide-switch to choose one or the other. However, the system seemed complicated to anyone brought up on straightforward volume and tone controls—in other words, more or less everyone.', 'That dual-circuit idea was adapted from a layout that Forrest White had devised back in the \'40s, before he joined Fender. He saw the pioneering electric guitarist Alvino Rey at a gig in Ohio struggling to change from rhythm to lead. Later, Rey visited the Fender factory, and White told him they might have a solution. "So Leo brought the Jazzmaster out," White told me, "and that guitar was the first where you could switch between rhythm and lead. Leo was trying to get more of a jazz sound than the high, piercing Telecaster sound."', 'In fact, jazz guitarists found little appeal in this new, rather awkward solidbody guitar, and mainstream Fender fans largely stayed with their Strats and Teles. Bob Bogle in The Ventures played a Jazzmaster for a while in the early \'60s, and a few surfers, including The Surfaris of "Wipe Out" fame, seemed to like the way you could switch from snap to smooth with the presets. The accomplished American instrumentalist Roy Lanham favored a Jazzmaster for a while, too, but at the time about the only full-on jazzers who indulged the new Fender were Joe Pass and the lesser-known Eddie Duran, although both proved to be brief flirtations. Jazzmen kept hold of their hollowbody electrics, and Fender had to come to terms with what must have seemed like its first misstep.', "The Jazzmaster's offset body influenced the look of a few other Fender models that followed, including the Jazz Bass (1960), the VI (1961), the Jaguar (1962), and the Electric XII (1965). The Jazzmaster itself went through a few cosmetic changes. Its pickguard was at first one of Fender's gold-colored aluminum types, generally known as anodized, but in '59 these nine-screw metal guards gave way to 13-screw tortoiseshell or white plastic ones. In '65, the same year that the Strat borrowed the Jazzmaster's broader headstock, the Jazzmaster gained binding to its fingerboard, and the following year block-shaped fingerboard markers replaced the original dots.", "The streamlined offset shape of the Jazzmaster seemed to benefit particularly well from one of Fender's custom colors, which added a gleaming throb of color to an already cool object. The arresting delights of fiesta red, lake placid blue metallic, teal green, shoreline gold metallic, and the rest seemed well suited to a Jazzmaster—and didn't cost much. In 1963, for example, a color finish would add just $17.47 extra to the list price of a regular $349.50 sunburst. Which, on reflection today, you might call a good investment.", "During the '70s, Fender's new CBS management cut back the existing lines and offered few new models. The Jazzmaster—by now boasting a black pickguard—disappeared from the catalogue and was phased out of production by 1980, not returning for another six years or so.", 'Boardroom doubts in California coincided with a new popularity among up-and-coming guitarists for the Jazzmaster and other Fenders considered by some as second-rank models. Part of this was due to the punk ethic of being seen (at least in theory) to have little cash. Jazzmasters were relatively unloved and so relatively cheap on the secondhand market compared to the burgeoning prices of what were now being tagged as "vintage" Strats and Teles.', "One of the best of the new breed was Tom Verlaine, who in the New York group Television played a Jazzmaster and showed its versatility on 1977's Marquee Moon album. In Britain, it was necessary to listen no further than Robert Smith in The Cure and Elvis Costello fronting The Attractions, both of whom selected a Jazzmaster as their six-string of choice.", "Since then the Jazzmaster's reputation has waxed and waned, reissues have come and gone, improvements have been made, and a select bunch of guitarists continue to discover its particular allure. Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr., My Bloody Valentine, and more sparked a '90s revival that continues to this day, making the Jazzmaster one of the most popular choices in some indie circles.", 'Fender revived the Offset description a few years back as a family name for many of its wonky-body models, and the look has inspired other makers to re-evaluate this 60-year-old design. As Justin Norvell at Fender puts it: "The big trend now, which has been taking years to bubble up to the surface, is the general acceptance of the Jazzmaster as not a quirky model but a legitimate platform."', 'About the Author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

In the UK, though, interest was confined to a few questing individuals, including Daphne Oram and Desmond Briscoe, both BBC staff members. Through 1957, while working out-of-hours creating electronic sound for pioneering BBC broadcasts, the pair lobbied the corporation to create its own electronic music studio.", 'When the BBC Radiophonic Workshop opened on April 1, 1958, at the BBC studio in Maida Vale, west London, there was a sense of giving in to tiresome zealots. Dick Mills, the longest-serving member of the Workshop staff, told me about the unspoken but implied BBC attitude, which was: "Why don\'t we give them a room somewhere—and let them get it out of their systems?"', "The Workshop was equipped with tape recorders, turntables, oscillators—the tools of the '50s electronic musician—but in this case secondhand, obsolete, and sometimes broken. The mixer, for example, was a pre-war antique with an oak body and had once been installed in the Royal Albert Hall.", 'From such inauspicious beginnings, the Workshop made a swift impact, and large audiences began hearing radical electronic music. Screenwriter Nigel Kneale made notes for sound design for his BBC television serial Quatermass And The Pit (1958/\'59) such as "electronic vibration with occult noises." Briscoe, assisted by Mills, interpreted these with spliced and reversed recordings of feedback, echoed drums, and disconnecting amplifiers. The final episode was watched by a fifth of the UK\'s population.', 'Oram left within a year, but others soon joined, including Delia Derbyshire and Brian Hodgson. It fell to Derbyshire, assisted by Mills, to realise composer Ron Grainer\'s theme for a new children\'s sci-fi television series. Grainer delivered a single sheet of paper, with a bassline, a melody, and instructions to convey atmosphere, such as "wind bubble" and "cloud."', "From this, Derbyshire, with Mills again, took two weeks in August 1963 to create the most recognisable piece of British electronic music. The Doctor Who theme was first heard on November 21 that year, at 5:15 p.m., and remained in service (with various reboots) until 1980. Hodgson, meanwhile, created the equally famous sound of the TARDIS dematerialization from a recording he'd made by scraping a key down a bass string of a broken piano.", "Through the '60s, electronic music edged away from tape composition toward voltage-controlled synthesis. The Workshop's composers, managed by Briscoe, observed with interest, and in 1969 there was talk of buying a Moog. It came to nothing, due to cost, bureaucracy, and perhaps reticence from Briscoe himself. Instead, the Workshop turned its attention to Electronic Music Studios (EMS).", "Founded in 1969 by Peter Zinovieff, Tristram Cary, and David Cockerell, EMS had ties with the Workshop. In 1966, Zinovieff had formed Unit Delta Plus with a moonlighting Derbyshire and Hodgson. The trio created electronic music in a studio in the garden of Zinovieff's house in Putney, south-west London, which backed onto the River Thames. Cary had been making electronic music years before the Workshop formed and built probably the first electronic music home studio in England. Though never a Workshop member, he often visited, and he worked regularly on Doctor Who.", "Based at Zinovieff's Putney house, EMS produced the joystick-controlled VCS3 in 1969, which was priced less than the new Minimoog. The Workshop purchased several VCS3s and later a Synthi 100, a huge modular system known as the Delaware, and the new technology contributed to a changing of the guard. Sixties stalwarts Hodgson and Derbyshire were gone within a few years of the synths' arrival. Derbyshire was primarily a tape composer, and she never fully embraced synths. Hodgson did, but he decided—for a while—to explore their potential elsewhere.", "It fell to a new generation, including Paddy Kingsland, Roger Limb, and Peter Howell, to take the synths in hand. The synths were quicker compositional and recording tools than tape, but they had their quirks. So sensitive was the Delaware to temperature that it was prone to going out of tune when the studio door was opened. Even so, it was widely used, including by Kingsland on the (recently reissued) soundtrack to the children's television series The Changes (1975) and for effects on the original radio series of The Hitch-Hikers Guide To The Galaxy (1978).", "Briscoe retired in 1977, replaced as Workshop Organiser by the returning Hodgson. In his five years away, Hodgson had made electronic music commercially, with some success. He found a Workshop that now contained expensive equipment, but it retained a cobbled-together feel. Hodgson knew that synth development was accelerating. The once-futuristic Delaware looked like a dinosaur by the end of the '70s. He methodically retooled the Workshop, and by the mid-'80s he had his composers working in studios with Yamaha DX7s, at least one Fairlight, and Apple Macs.", 'Traditionalists grumbled, but Howell told Sound On Sound in 2008: "There\'s still this prevailing idea that we were somehow almost traitors for using modern gear and computers! Some people still believe that the original Workshop … was the only incarnation that mattered. But … why on earth should I spend three weeks chopping up little bits of tape to get exactly the same result? We had to catch up with the real world."', "A high-profile product from this era was Elizabeth Parker's score for David Attenborough's The Living Planet (1984), which made extensive use of the PPG Wave 2.2.", 'As the cost of electronic music equipment fell in inverse proportion to its availability, a new generation of freelancers set up home studios of a sophistication once unimaginable. Electronic music was no longer the preserve of the big professional studio.', "John Birt, who was appointed as the BBC's director-general in 1992, initiated measures intended to make the corporation run more like a commercial business. Birt's BBC evaluated departments according to their economic efficiency, and the Workshop couldn't compete financially with freelance composers. It could artistically, though, and continued to work on flagship projects such as Michael Palin's Full Circle television series (1997). But its influence was waning. In the Workshop's '70s heyday, there were 300-plus commissions per year. In 1997, there were just eight.", 'Hodgson left in 1995. The following year Mark Ayres, a composer who had worked on Doctor Who in the late \'80s, was summoned. He told me: "There were three rooms of sketchily catalogued tapes, and there was a move to dispose of them. I was called by Peter Howell, Paddy Kingsland, and Brian Hodgson—individually, but in quick succession—asking if I would take on the cataloging and preservation, as they\'d found a friendly ear in BBC Radio Production Resources, Colin Duff."', 'The tapes, catalogued and labeled by Ayres, were moved from Maida Vale to the BBC archive on April 1, 1998, 40 years to the day since the Workshop had first opened. By this time it was history. Ayres said: "At the last, it was just Peter Howell and Elizabeth Parker left, working on Full Circle. Peter had a home studio, and completed his work there, so Liz was the last person at Maida Vale. She was made redundant before the programmes were completed, so she finished the job as a freelance, renting her studio back from the BBC until it was done."', "Almost as soon as it was gone, the Workshop was nostalgically eulogised. Compilations were issued on CD, while magazine articles contributed to developing cults around Derbyshire and Oram in particular. A TV documentary,The Alchemists Of Sound (2003), featured Workshop alumni reminiscing about their glory days. Oliver Postgate, of Bagpuss and Clangers fame, was the narrator, a choice that underlined the programme's positioning of the Workshop as a peculiarly British example of homespun creativity and ingenuity.", 'Fittingly for an institution so connected with Doctor Who, in May 2009 the Workshop reconvened in a new form. Ayres rounded up Limb, Kingsland, Howell, and the venerable Mills for a concert at The Roundhouse in north-west London. Billed as The Radiophonic Workshop, the quintet, backed by a brass section and drummer, performed arrangements of BBC highlights, including Hitch-Hikers and Doctor Who, alongside new compositions.', "This incarnation of the Workshop continues, with live performances and a 2017 album of new material, Burials In Several Earths. And the London Contemporary Orchestra performed a Pioneers Of Sound concert during 2018's Proms at the Albert Hall as a tribute to the Workshop and including works by Oram and Derbyshire.", 'Meanwhile, in a situation mirroring the afterlife of so many heritage rock bands, in 2012 Arts Council England and the BBC launched the New Radiophonic Workshop as an online venture, under composer Matthew Herbert as creative director. Herbert\'s first work took audio from 25 previous Workshop projects to create what he described as a "curious murmur of activity."', 'About the author: Mark Brend is an author and a musician.

For more than 40 years, Anthony Agnello has, in his words, "stumbled through this delicate dance" with his work and craftsmanship at his pioneering firm, Eventide Audio.', "Following his design of the H910 and H949 Harmonizers in the mid-'70s, Anthony set out to make groundbreaking space design effects commercially available for the first time. Developed between 1978–1981, the Eventide Signal Processor Model SP 2016 was pro audio's first programmable effects box—and it introduced the concept of the plugin to the music production and audio engineering communities, with its interchangeable ROM plugin chips.", '"I started researching reverb in earnest in 1978. Once I realized the kind of processing power and architecture needed to code a convincing simulation of a room, I made the decision to build an array processor that could be programmed to do other effects that I was interested in as well," Agnello says.', "In 2012, Eventide released the 2016 Stereo Room VST/AU plugin—a popular digital version of the original hardware's stereo room reverb setting. But until today, with the release of the SP2016 Reverb plugin, all of the reverb algorithms of Agnello's hardware processor had never been included in a digital format.", "To celebrate the release, we're looking back at the history of the effects processor and taking a look at all of what's possible with this new plugin.", 'Released in 1982, the SP2016 was a 3U rackmount multi-effects processor that could be customized, programmed, and even had enough memory to save user presets and instantly recall them.', "The scope of the processing capabilities the SP2016 was constantly expandable—thanks to its pioneering use of ROM chips that provided new effect algorithms. When loaded up, different chips would allow for different functions. The machine's main buttons, like Execute, Command, and Softkey, would control a certain aspect of one effect's preset, but entirely differently parameters for another, depending on which ROM chip was employed.", 'The SP2016 was capable of a large variety of effects processing: delays, reverbs (reverse, gated, infinite), digital filtering, EQ, gain control, chorusing, flanging, as well as introducing new effects like vocoding, looping, band delays, timescramble, and various forms of synthesis. It also offered signal analysis and self-diagnostic testing.', '"People had trouble understanding what it was and what it could do. Digital reverbs like the EMT, Lexicon, and Sony, were very popular products, and we confused a lot of people who just wanted a great reverb. We would have been better off if we had limited the box to just reverb," Agnello says.', 'Algorithmically modular by design, the on-going development of these ever-expanding ROM chips—featuring even more refined algorithms—resulted in a suite of effects that introduced such iconic reverb programs as "Room Reverb," "Hi Density Plate," and "Stereo Room."', 'Revered for its signature rich lushness, the SP2016 can be heard on many iconic records from Talking Heads and Madonna to Mariah Carey, Eminem, and more. Predominantly used by notable engineers and producers, such as Dave Pensado, George Massenburg, Alan Sides, Roy Hendrickson, Jack Douglas, and Mick Guzauski, the SP2016 has been a secret guest star on countless hits since its release in the early 1980s.', '"The SP2016 had, I\'d argue, more convincing reverbs and a wider range of reverbs than most any other product available, but the box confused the hell out of people. For instance, it had a button labeled Softkey and, at trade shows, people would ask me what it did and I\'d say, \'It depends on the algorithm,\' and they\'d glaze over," Agnello says.', 'With the initial design conception and on-going ROM chip modularity improvements, Eventide opened up the ability for anyone who wanted to develop algorithms for the SP2016, offering a complete development system—an open-source schematic—featuring software defined controls such as switches, buttons, and of course, the Softkey control. The additional features of MIDI integration and remote control made the SP2016 the most cutting-edge effects processor of its era.', 'But soon, those technological advancements gave way to another.', '"By the mid-\'80s, chip vendors like TI introduced DSP chips, capable of processing full bandwidth audio, rendering the array processor technology at the heart of the SP2016 obsolete," Agnello says.', 'The next incarnation of the original SP2016 arrived in the form of the Eventide Reverb 2016 by Princeton Digital—a company founded in 2002 by Anthony. The Princeton Digital unit naturally simulates every aspect of the sound of a real enclosure, including the smooth Gaussian decay of the reverb tail.', 'Agnello formed Princeton Digital to apply the recent advances in DSP technology to the reproduction of high-quality, modern versions of some of those earlier Eventide effects. The Reverb 2016 featured more complex early reflections, higher density, and extensive, precise parametric controls, such as 24-bit fixed point digital signal processing, 24-bit analog I/O, digital I/O, and a MIDI interface.', "Built specifically for reverb and not multi-effects processing, the Princeton Digital reverb unit represented the evolution in DSP technological developments—including a drastically increased bandwidth—allowing the processing of previously impossible computations before, within the limitations of the SP2016's array technology.", "Originally released as a TDM version in 2008, the Stereo Room plugin was Eventide's first step towards a software version of the original SP2016. It featured Stereo Room, Room, and Plate algorithms from the original unit. In 2012, they ported this TDM version to run as a VST/AU formated plugin, capturing a larger audience with the Eventide 2016 Stereo Room Reverb.", 'This simple yet effective reverb processor was crafted to simulate a great sounding "room." Focusing on just this one famous reverb algorithm from the original SP2016, the 2016 Stereo Room was distinctive with its complex early reflections, smooth decay tail, and EQ block, as well as the character-altering diffusion and decay controls.', 'For the the first time ever, this classic reverb algorithm was made available in a processor format that could allow multiple instances running simultaneously. Piquing the interest of old school fans of the original SP2016 unit room sound, this intuitive plugin got the preset treatment from Joe Chiccarelli, George Massenburg, and Dave Pensado—with all of them crafting settings that range from subtle spaces to the characteristic lush room sounds and everything in between.', "Fast forward to today, Eventide Audio has finally released the long awaited plugin version of the world's first plugin with the Eventide SP2016 Reverb.", 'Building upon the the old and the new, the Eventide SP2016 Reverb plugin features all of the lush and natural-sounding elements found within both iterations of this quintessential multi-effects processor, and more.', 'Combining the previous sonic familiarities and spatial distinctions, this new addition to the Eventide product line features even more functionality than ever, including the ability to run many instances at once on the same channel—as is implicit with music software plugins—or multiple processing busses in tandem.', 'This reverb plugin offers their full spectrum of classic lush reverbs, delays, and multi-effects for a fraction of the cost of the hardware, opening up this sound design tool to an entirely new generation of pro audio enthusiasts.', '"The Princeton Digital box, TDM release, as well as the 2016 Stereo Room were based on my initial attempts at emulating the original SP2016 box. The algorithms are fairly exact, but I did screw up some minor stuff, including— funnily enough—the sample rate," Agnello says. "My memory was that the original sample rate was exactly 40kHz. Turns out it\'s close, but not exact. I never bothered to measure the box."', '"That, plus a few other errors/bugs resulted in the Princeton Digital stuff sounding really good, but not exactly like the hardware. Eventide\'s DSP guys decided to dig in and \'make it right,\' the Eventide SP2016 Reverb Plugin is the great-sounding result of that," Agnello says.', 'It ships with a large offering of presets, with many designed by the legendary engineers and producers who originally made such creative use of the hardware unit, including Joe Chiccarelli, George Massenburg, and Dave Pensado. As a new Eventide Artist, this reverb plugin is the first production release software I was asked to contribute preset designs to.', 'Included among this esteemed collective of audio professionals, it was an honor to contribute presets for this this historic product release. The presets I made for this processor cover a variety of use cases—from almost every instrument and sound that you would find wanting space around—including a variety of options for vintage and modern spatial aesthetics.', 'To celebrate the product launch, users can take 70% off the Eventide SP2016 Reverb plugin on Reverb, now through October 31. Registered owners of Anthology XI or the 2016 Stereo Room are qualified for a special upgrade offer of just $29 USD, also until October 31.', 'These 30 presets were designed in the process of producing an upcoming release, "Languid Lament," for a project being released next year on Minneapolis imprint, Abstrakt Xpressions.', 'Check out the audio demos of project to hear my presets in action.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

Alongside Sonor, Trixon rose from a stricken post-war Germany. But while today Sonor has prospered, Trixon's reign was cut short in 1971, and the brand is now recalled fondly for its crazily shaped shells.", 'Trixon was not unique in this—there was a propensity in Europe for the novel—but Trixon was the daddy. Later badged as Vox in the United States, Trixon was a pioneer in other areas too, with bold finishes and some nifty hardware designs.', 'The drum set is an invention of the 20th century and it was evolving rapidly when the not insignificant squabble of World War II held things back and devastated European production. The north German city of Hamburg was pummelled by Allied bombing, but from the ashes Karl-Heinz Weimer, a remarkable 30-year-old musician, inventor, and entrepreneur, launched Trixon drums. His path was, to say the least, "tricky"—a word from which the Trixon name was apparently derived.', 'Germany remained under the occupation of British forces in the north and American in the south, and the troops hankered after jazz and swing music, hitherto forbidden under the German Reich. Unfortunately, Germany had very few suitable instruments, which afforded Weimer the chance to follow his dream. Clearing a patch of stricken land, he began manufacturing in a ruined air-raid shelter. He secured a trade licence on September 18, 1947, and the company was officially born.', "By 1948, Weimer had moved to another ruined shell of a building, building it up room by room to make the first Trixon factory and using it through to 1956. Despite all manner of tricky problems to do with supplies and materials, Weimer succeeded almost immediately. He'd found a niche that needed filling, and he built not only drum sets but also Latin percussion, vibraphones, sticks and mallets, music desks, and more.", "From the start, Trixon products were distinctive and of professional quality, and they were first exhibited at a trade show in 1948. Over the next few years, Weimer's success attracted business partners and capital, and in 1953 he registered the Trixon trademark at the German patent office.", 'Additionally, Weimer opened his Music City store in Steindamm, Hamburg, in 1955 and soon took on distribution deals for Paiste, Zildjian, and others. His story is full of remarkable incidents, not least when Robert Zildjian (who later founded Sabian cymbals) visited Trixon in Hamburg in 1954. Zildjian, who had served with the U.S. Forces in the war, recognised Weimer as a prisoner-of-war musician whose services the Americans had called upon, and a deep friendship was sealed.', 'Trixon not only became popular in Europe but attracted visiting American jazz stars, the most prominent being the great Lionel Hampton, who endorsed both Trixon vibraphones and drums. Weimer and Hampton, too, became lifelong friends.', "Weimer had a counterpart in the UK in Ivor Arbiter. Arbiter also faced post-war obstacles, in particular the British government's restrictions on American imports, intended to boost UK businesses and lessen the hellish dollar deficit. This meant Arbiter could not bulk-import the American instruments—particularly guitars and drums—that British musicians craved. Britain made very few guitars, and they were exactly what was needed as rock took over from jazz. Instead, dealers and distributors in the UK scoured Europe, which is how Arbiter came upon Trixon drums.", 'In fact, while UK guitarists made do with all manner of foreign guitars, British drummers were well catered for by British-built Premier drums and smaller competitors such as Ajax, Beverley, and Carlton. But Premier ran a tight dealer structure, which Arbiter resented. So in 1957, he struck an import deal with Weimer to bring over from Germany around 50 Trixon drum sets every month.', "Arbiter's close contacts through The Paramount music shop in London's West End, which he'd opened with his father Joe in 1957, meant he was able to persuade jazz heavyweights such as Phil Seamen and Allan Ganley to endorse Trixon. Soon the young rockers came on board, too, including Brian Bennett, Clem Cattini, Bob Henrit, and many more.", 'Serious players mostly stuck with Trixon\'s conventionally shaped Luxus outfits. Arbiter\'s sidekick Gerry Evans, who worked at The Paramount, told me: "Karl-Heinz Weimer was such an innovator. Trixon wasn\'t fantastic, but it was progressive. For example, all the stands had spring-loaded ("klick-klack") legs, an idea that was later copied by Ajax."', 'Arbiter added: "Weimer was ahead of his time, and he developed a lot of die-cast stuff in nice, ship-shape forms. We did quite well with Trixon, but drumming was getting heavier and Trixon started to make some silly mistakes." By the early \'60s, Arbiter says he eased away from Trixon because of quality problems. "While the hardware looked OK, it wasn\'t too strong. The nut boxes would come off, for example."', "With UK restrictions on American gear finally lifted as the '60s dawned, Arbiter made the bold decision to import the expensive Ludwig drums. He opened Drum City at 114 Shaftesbury Avenue in the West End in 1962, and pretty soon Ringo Starr came knocking. Arbiter told me that he tried to push a Trixon set on to Ringo, but Ringo was not having it.", 'Throughout its history, Trixon produced a conventional four-piece drum set, the Luxus 0/200. In 1963, Arbiter listed the Luxus at 161 guineas, which was considerably less than a Ludwig Super Classic and much closer to an equivalent Premier set.', 'Many Luxus sets survive today, and like contemporary Sonor sets, they were built from quality German beech. Also like Sonor—and many UK drums of the period, too—they had teardrop-shape die-cast lugs until around 1963, when they were replaced by oblong lugs with isolating gaskets that enhanced resonance and were ahead of their time.', 'However, Trixon will forever be associated with crazily shaped shells. The Speedfire 0/700 set with its elliptical egg-shape bass drum appeared as early as 1956, and it was showcased by Lionel Hampton. The idea was to conjoin a small and a large bass drum in a single shell with an internal partition. The flat bottom hoop could accommodate two side-by-side bass pedals. There was also a row of single-headed toms arranged in "backward" order, which made it easier to mount them level. And finally, there was the monstrous 20-inch-diameter Lionel Hampton Attraction floor tom, with its three V-shaped strengthened legs that enabled the athletic Hampton to jump up on it and play it in his frenetic showman style.', "While the Speedfire was ungainly, the Telstar, introduced in 1962 and named for the communications satellite, was fabulously modern looking—though in fact, with its antennae-like splayed floor tom legs, it looked more like Russia's earlier Sputnik. It was also more practical than the Speedfire. The Telstar was the set with the conical shells, Trixon's most abiding image, requiring a production process that was enormously wasteful of timber. Yet the concept was actually sonic rather than visual, intended to compress and intensify the sound from the large batter head to the smaller resonant head, like a sort of reverse megahorn.", "Trixon's turnover reached around 3,000,000 Deutschmarks in 1965, about $750,000 at the time. In December '65, Weimer moved his Music City emporium to Hamburg's Reeperbahn, scene of The Beatles' earlier exploits and where British groups still plied their trade. With about 7,500 square feet of retail space, Music City was one of Germany's biggest music stores.", "That same year, Weimer visited the Far East and returned with a contract to produce a thousand marching drums for Chairman Mao's troops, no less. With sales in the USA also booming, he needed a large increase in manufacturing capacity, and in 1966 Weimer built a new plant in Reinbek, about 12 miles east of Hamburg. It covered 43,000 square feet and employed 140 workers.", "Trixon's reputation was now such that none other than Buddy Rich visited the Reinbek factory on March 29, 1967. Rich was hard on the formation of his Big Band and his consequent wowing of Europe, and he came personally to pick up his specially designed Luxus outfit. He'd somehow been persuaded by Weimer to endorse the drums—a rumoured sweetener of $100,000 may have swayed his mind—but the relationship lasted after just a few months, with Buddy reverting to Slingerland or Fibes or both once he was back home. Never mind—what's certain is that James Brown's drummers played Vox-branded Trixon drums on stage during 1968.", "All this feverish activity led to Trixon's fatal mistake and its shockingly speedy demise. This was the infamous move to Ireland. The Irish government was offering considerable financial, economic, and tax inducements to bring work to the beleaguered Republic. Trixon Ltd moved most production from Reinbek to a 600-acre industrial estate at Shannon Airport, the world's first free-trade zone, working alongside the Dutch Rippen piano company. Rippen pioneered a lightweight piano using wood, metal, and plastics, thus sharing many similar procedures with Trixon. It made sense to share facilities and inventory—for the moment.", "Trixon was already distributed in the U.S. by St Louis Music Supply Co, but Rippen's deal there was with the Thomas Organ Company, and the Shannon-built Trixon was able to avail itself of this favourable connection for distribution, sales, publicity, and so on. Thomas also distributed the famous British Vox amplifiers, and thus Trixon was re-branded Vox in the USA. This necessitated a change of names for the sets, presumably to avoid a conflict with St Louis, which is why for Thomas the Trixon Luxus became the Vox Thunderbolt, the Trixon Telstar became the Vox Fanjet, and the Trixon Speedfire, confusingly, became the Vox Telstar.", "Unfortunately, Rippen's cheap-piano experiment did not work out and its Shannon operation went belly-up around 1971, dragging the inextricably bound Trixon down with it. With 70 percent of production machinery held in Shannon, Weimer could not continue in Hamburg, although he did offer parts and servicing for several years through his successful Music City store.", "The remaining inventory was stored by Weimer right up to the year before his death in 1997 at the age of 80. A colleague, Arthur Oeschger, bought the rights and hardware, intending to revive the brand, and he exhibited at the Frankfurt instrument show in 1997 and '98. However, it was not to be. In 1998, everything was destroyed in a fire, putting an end to any comeback for the original Trixon drums. [ Ed.: In 2007, Jim Laabs, Oeschger's business partner in the '90s, began to produce drums and percussion instruments again under the Trixon name.]", "About the Author: Geoff Nicholls is a musician, author, journalist, and lecturer based in London.

Read the rest of the series here:', 'This summer, we published "When Did Guitarists First Use Tremolo, Echo, and Other Early Effects?". It probed four classic effects that were first created by cumbersome electro-mechanical means, but which fired up guitarists\' desires to adulterate the natural sound of the instrument. Today, we\'re delving into some of the more processed sounds enabled by the transistor revolution of the \'60s.', 'Fuzz is arguably one of the fiercest effects available to the electric guitarist, and one of the most dynamic, yet it has its roots in a bass guitar track recorded for a commercial country artist in the early \'60s. While recording Grady Martin\'s bass part for Marty Robbins\'s 1961 hit "Don\'t Worry," Nashville engineer Glen Snoddy was utterly transfixed by the distorted sound that ensued when the tube preamp in one of the mixer\'s channels started to fail. He and the client not only agreed that the resultant "fuzz bass" track was worth keeping, Snoddy set out to replicate the sound in a standalone box. His circuit evolved into the Maestro Fuzz-Tone pedal a couple years later, and the rest is history.', 'Rock historians still argue about the first fuzz-guitar solo, which is sometimes credited to Big Jim Sullivan\'s guitar track on the \'64 P.J. Proby hit "Hold Me" in the UK, recorded via a custom unit made by Roger Mayer, and sometimes a Snoddy-made pedal used by Nokie Edwards of The Ventures to record "The 2,000 Pound Bee" in \'62. The first major smash for the commercial fuzz pedal, the Maestro Fuzz-Tone, came from the Rolling Stones\' "(I Can\'t Get No) Satisfaction", released in June of \'65 in the UK and two months later in the US. Cross the Stones\' booming popularity with the infectious new sound of the fuzz itself, and a sonic revolution was born.', "The Fuzz-Tone circuit itself is extremely simple, employing just three transistors and a handful of resistors and capacitors, but its sound is often considered one of the most expressive in rock. Much of the magic of the early units from Maestro and other manufacturers comes from the germanium transistors they relied upon, which can have a lush, rich sound and a tactile, somewhat compressed playing feel. Their tolerances also varied widely, however, to the extent that no two early fuzz boxes ever sounded entirely the same, while some could sound outright dull and uninspiring and others utterly sublime (silicon transistors began to replace germanium in the late '60s).", "By the latter part of the mid-'60s every guitar-gear manufacturer worth its salt was producing—or at least re-badging—a fuzz box of its own. Other classics came in the form of Arbiter's Fuzz Face, the Vox Tone Bender, Baldwin's Buzzaround, the Marshall Supa Fuzz, and others.", "Take an early fuzz box, lop off a transistor or two, and tweak the EQ to emphasize the high frequencies and you've pretty much got yourself a treble booster. Originally designed to do exactly what it says on the can—in an age when treble was the key to helping you cut through the mix (witness the Top Boost, bright switches, and brilliant channels of the era)—treble boosters fast became popular for their ability to kick an edge-of-breakup tube amp into juicy overdrive, regardless of EQ disposition, and these simple designs have remained favorites of many guitarists ever since.", 'The Dallas Rangemaster Treble Booster is the granddaddy of the genre, and it\'s not so much a "pedal" as an amp-top box that contains an input for the guitar cable, and a hardwired "pigtail" lead out the back to connect it to the amp. Otherwise, you get an on/off slide switch—no stomp button—and a gain-level control (labeled "Set"), and that\'s it. The circuit contains a mere nine components in total, and originals can go for well north of $2,000 USD on the vintage market.', 'Having called the thing a Treble Booster, it\'s worth noting that the tag can be somewhat misleading: the Rangemaster circuit doesn\'t so much make your guitar brighter, as it boosts the higher frequencies more than the lower. The unit debuted in \'65, and it\'s most famous early use is usually pegged as Eric Clapton\'s application of the box on a few tracks on John Mayall\'s Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton album of \'66—although it\'s extremely difficult to say with absolute certainty which tracks employ the Treble Booster, if any. There seems to be just as much evidence that he didn\'t use the unit on the so-called Beano album (which is to say, little hard evidence that he did, despite many fans\' declarations that "that sounds just like a Rangemaster!"), but Clapton may have used one later for live shows, or on some Cream tracks, or… who knows.', "Whatever the truth of the matter, the treble booster as a genre of effect became extremely popular through the late '60s and into the '70s, and the Dallas unit and others were used by the likes of Jimmy Page, Tony Iommi, Ritchie Blackmore, Rory Gallagher, Brian May, and many others.", "If not for the persuasive efforts of a Los Angeles-based studio guitarist and inventor, the wah-wah pedal may have ended up on the scrapheap of musical history, rapidly abandoned as a novelty effect used briefly on mic'ed-up trumpets, trombones, and other brass instruments. Instead, thanks to Del Casher, it has endured as one of the most expressive effects ever tethered between guitar and amp.", 'In 1966 Casher was a first-call guitarist for sessions on the LA music, TV, and film scenes when his prolificity came to the attention of Thomas Organ. The LA company had recently partnered with JMI in the UK to distribute Vox gear for the U.S., as well as manufacturing their own renditions of many Vox-branded amps and other accessories. While both consulting with Thomas Organ for product development, and performing in the Vox Amplifonic Orchestra, Casher noticed that a quick twist of the Tone control on the new transistorized Vox amps used by all the musicians in the promotional group would produce a distinctive "wah" sound—and he was intrigued. Derived as a rotary version of the MRB switch (for "mid range boost") that legendary JMI engineer Dick Denney had developed for Vox\'s British transistorized amps, it was something much different than a traditional tone knob—simultaneously emphasizing different notches within the guitar\'s midrange frequency bands through a simple EQ filter, rather than just cutting high frequencies—and it gave Casher an idea.', "After a little persuading, Casher's boss at Thomas Organ agreed to assign engineers Brad Plunkett and Les Kushner to convert the circuit behind the knob into a standalone pedal with rocker treadle, with consultation from Casher, and the wah-wah was born. The only problem remaining was that Thomas Organ CEO Joe Banaron envisioned selling the things to horn players, because orchestras have several horn players and only one guitar player (hence the early endorsement of trumpeter Clyde McCoy, whose photo and name appeared on the bottoms of early production units). To convince Banaron otherwise, Casher produced a 10-song wah-wah guitar demonstration LP, recorded in his own garage studio in late '66. The promotional album was released early the next year, Casher proved his point, and the Vox Wah-Wah went into production in February '67, with the Thomas Organ Cry Baby available for U.S. sale following in '68.", 'Any of the tracks on Casher\'s demo LP of early \'67 stand as the "first examples" of recorded wah-wah guitar, although other early adopters came thick and fast. Casher had recorded with Frank Zappa and the Prunes previously, and Zappa himself soon became a major proponent of the wah-wah, as did Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton in the UK, both abiding exemplars of classic wah-wah use.', "This relatively simple, early transistor-based effect is potentially one of the freakiest available to the guitarist of the late '60s when used right—and arguably even wilder when used wrong—creating a note an octave higher than the original played, often with a hazy fuzz slathered over it, to enable the trippy, brassy, slightly dissonant guitar solos that helped to define psychedelic rock.", 'The original Octavia effect was invented by Roger Mayer around \'67 and only built as a few custom one-offs, used most notably by Jimi Hendrix on "Purple Haze" and other songs. Mayer developed Hendrix\'s octave divider with fuzz out of his experiments with doubling the frequency of a guitar signal to create the illusion of a note added an octave up from the original, but he never manufactured his invention as a production item for the commercial market, leaving the door open for others (most notably Tycobrahe) to follow with their own Octavia models. Mayer later introduced his own commercial rendition of the Octavia when he returned to building guitar pedals in the \'90s, after having segued into designing and building studio electronics following Hendrix\'s death in \'70.', 'Inside the box, the circuit that enables the seminal octave-divider sound isn\'t much more complicated than that of the early fuzz boxes and treble boosters discussed above, comprising just three transistors, an impedance interstage transformer, and several resistors and capacitors. Its operating principle, on the other hand, is pretty high-tech. As explained to me by Mayer several years ago, "It doubles the number of images of the note. And that, apparently, makes it sound twice the frequency, whereas it really isn\'t. Because the signal\'s going up and down twice as much, even though you\'ve changed the relationship of it, the ear perceives it as twice the frequency." Put another way, Mayer added, "It\'s like holding something up to a mirror. You see two of them, but there\'s still only one thing there." Fair enough.', "It often requires some practice to use an octave divider well. Traditional renditions only track single notes, and they prefer clean, direct picking, relatively few slurs and bends, and a signal not overladen with harmonic overtones. Best results are often achieved on a guitar's neck pickup, and a single-coil pickup at that, played up around the 12th fret or beyond. Get it right, though, and it's a surprisingly effective and infectious sound.", "Find the rest of the series below. Excited to learn more about the past, present, and future of effects?

Stay tuned for more interviews from Bacon's Archive coming soon. For previous installments, take a look at Tony's interviews with Tom Petty, Chet Atkins, Les Paul, and Gibson's Ted McCarty.", "In the interview below, conducted in 1995, Ray Butts discusses his invention of the Filter'Tron pickup, arguably the first humbucker ever created. Seth Lover—who created Gibson's own humbucker around the same time and applied for his patent first—has his own side of the story to tell in his Bacon's Archive interview here.", "I interviewed Ray Butts in 1995. Ray (1919–2003) was an electronics guy who in the '50s had a music store in Cairo, Illinois. He devised a combo amp with built-in tape echo, an unusual facility at the time, and through that he met Chet Atkins. Chet's friendship in turn led to Ray coming up with Gretsch's Filter'Tron humbucking pickup.", 'I spent an enjoyable afternoon chatting with Ray and his wife Ann at their home in Nashville as part of the research for my first book about Gretsch.', 'How did you become involved with Gretsch, Ray?', "Ray Butts: Well, first I met Chet Atkins, and I did that through the amplifier I came up with, the EchoSonic amplifier that I built. I'd heard about Chet. At that time he was playing on the Grand Ole Opry. He was featured—they used him playing solo just about every week, and of course he played with some of the stars there also.", 'I\'d hear him on a radio station from Cincinnati, Ohio, called WCKY—I was in Cairo, southern Illinois, at the time. About 5 o\'clock in the afternoon the propagation conditions were just right for WCKY to come booming into Cairo. The rest of the time you couldn\'t get it because of the distance. There was a fellow on there, name of Marty Roberts, had a country music program, and his theme song was Chet playing "Country Gentleman" on guitar. So that was another way that I got to know about Chet.', 'When was this?', 'RB: Well, it was about 1950 that I started experimenting with echoes, which led to my amplifier. At one time I had a thing that used two phonograph pickups, like piezo pickups, had a needle—I bought it, someone else made it—I was curious about it. He had the pickups mounted, and where the needles were he had a spring between the two, so that one is the driver and the other a receiver, and it did make an echo, though it was nothing to brag about. But I got to thinking of something better and finally came up with the idea of using the tape.', 'Had you already made your EchoSonic amp when you met Chet?', 'RB: At that time I had made one, and I made it for a fellow who I played with in a band. His name was Bill Gwaltney. Bill was a guitar player and he copied Les Paul, thought he was the greatest thing ever happened. \'Course, Les had just come out with recordings like "How High The Moon" with the overdubbing and tracking and all, and Bill loved that sound and said he wished he could make it.', "So I got to thinking about this amplifier, and after trying a few things I ended up with this amp, which used a tape loop to make an echo. First one I made used a wire loop, because at that time the tape was so bad. It hadn't been here too long since it was brought back from Germany after World War II. Tape was so bad, the noise and all, that I used wire. But then I had a problem with knots in the wire, clicking when they went by the record–playback head. Then they improved the tape, when 3M got to making it. So I made the amp, and Bill Gwaltney bought the first one.", 'Presumably there was nothing like this available at the time, with the built-in tape echo?', "RB: Nothing at all. Bill could take this right out on a job, which he did, clubs and things, and get that echo sound. When I decided to make some more, well, I was in a small town. You're not gonna find too many people in a small town to spend 400, 500 dollars for an amplifier. I thought of coming to Nashville, because Nashville was getting to be a music center, particularly for what they used to call hillbilly music. Now they call it country music, but guitar players were called hillbillies—that was a common term.", 'So I came down to Nashville in the spring of 1954 and met Chet. When I first met him he lived in a little wooden bungalow in Belle Meade, southwest Nashville. Anyway, he gave me an order for an amplifier, which I delivered some several months later.', 'What was his impression when you showed it to him?', "RB: I brought it down and he was put up in the Clarkson Hotel, on 7th Avenue North, next door to where National Life & Accident was—they had an office building there where WSM had some studios. They did rehearsing there for the Opry. Artists would all come there on the Saturday afternoon, rehearse what they were gonna do on the Opry. 'Course, Chet was in on that.", 'I met him there on that Saturday afternoon, after I\'d come in on the Friday. So he said we\'ll take it up the studio, plug it up, see what you got. We took it up, plugged it up, played through it, and he liked it. He says, "How about taking it out to the Opry tonight" I said, "Sure, fine, I\'ll pick you up at the hotel about 6 o\'clock." So he played it on the Opry, same night.', "Chet liked it, and so did just about everybody else who saw it, which included Billy Byrd, who played with Ernest Tubb. He talked me into bringing it over to the Ernest Tubb record shop—they had that Midnight Jamboree after the Opry there. So I took it over there and he played it, tried to get me to give him one [laughs], which Chet thankfully didn't do.", 'He asked if I could be at the hotel Sunday afternoon. He said he\'d drop by and see me, and did. I said, "Maybe a $100 deposit," and he said, Would you take a trade-in?" [Laughs] I said, "Well normally not, but what you got?" He had a little Fender, wasn\'t a big one—think I allowed him $100 for it.', 'What was it that people liked about your amp?', 'RB: Oh, Chet liked the echo. My amp had controls on it to do slapback—you could adjust the echo, balance the echo volume against the main volume, just put the echo down real shallow underneath it. Had a full range of adjustment, which you really couldn\'t do with some of the others. He liked it, and he used that slapback probably on "Mister Sandman." He was making an appearance over in Knoxville, maybe a fair or convention or something, and he called me—this was maybe February, March 1954. So this was like in the summer, I promised it to him, and he called me, said he was anxious to get it, so I got it for him so he could take it over there and use it.', "[Other customers for Ray's EchoSonic amp included Scotty Moore and Carl Perkins. There is evidence that in 1958 Gretsch considered marketing the amp, but the idea went no further than prototyping a Gretsch case and some discussion.]", "After that, Chet and I became acquainted, we went back and forth, and I came down to Nashville and visited him once in a while. So a little later after he got the amplifier, he was negotiating with Gretsch to endorse their guitars. It was Jimmie Webster, who was a promotion man for Gretsch—he recommended him to Mr. Gretsch, that's Fred Gretsch Jr.", 'Ann Butts: I remember Jimmie Webster said that when he first mentioned to Mr. Gretsch that he ought to get someone like Chet Atkins to endorse the guitar, Mr. Gretsch said, "Why should I pay a hillbilly guitar player to use his name on our guitars?" But [laughs] Chet put Gretsch on the map.', 'What did you make of Jimmie Webster? Had you met him before?', "RB: Yeah, I had met Jimmie at trade shows. He was a promotional man, and Jimmie had a very uncommon style of playing. I understand Harry DeArmond played the same way, what they call a touch-style playing. Use the left hand to make the chord sound, and then they'd use the fingers and push the strings down on the frets for this lead line. It was kind of impressive to watch him play and all. Trade shows and so on, he'd be there to demonstrate Gretsch guitars, and I'd seen him there a time or two, because I was in the music business, had a music store. So I had met him and seen him before.", "I believe Chet didn't like the original pickups on his signature Gretsch 6120.", 'RB: No, he didn\'t like the DeArmond pickups that Gretsch were using at the time. It just didn\'t fit his style of playing at that time, mainly that thumb, finger style. He said they just didn\'t sound right. He said, "Why don\'t you make me a pickup?"', 'Primarily what he wanted was a proper balance between the bass and the treble and the midrange, for that thumb effect he used, and he really didn\'t get it with those pickups. For one thing, the magnets on the DeArmonds were too strong. They kept sucking the strings and stopping the sustain. I saw some where he\'d broken the bass-string magnets in two in a vice with a hammer [laughs]. So he said to me, "Why don\'t you make me a pickup?" I had done some experimenting with pickups before, so I said OK.', "My idea from the beginning was to build a humbucking pickup, because I knew about the concept from working with transformers. I'd fooled around with recording, and Ampex used the humbucking principle in the pickups of their tape-recorder heads, to avoid hum pick-up—they operate at a real low level, they're very sensitive to any hum. I was aware of the idea for years, probably from the '30s. It wasn't a new idea, been around practically all this century [speaking in 1995], and it's a very simple principle. You get electronics books, they'll explain it, how there's times when it's desirable.", 'When you designed your humbucking pickup, what did you base that on? Where did the design come from?', "RB: Well, what I was thinking—when Chet told me why don't you build me a pickup, I thought, How can I make a pickup that's different? That's really what I was thinking about. How can I make something that's different, and maybe better, than what's already out there, than what's already been done?", 'So I\'d be thinking that over, mulling it over, and in the meantime I was working on my amplifier, and I was talking to a guy, Ralph Kenyon, who built the transformers for my amplifiers up in Marion, Illinois. I had conversations with him, told him what I had in mind, he said, "Yeah, that\'d work." Like I say, I\'d been aware for years and years of the humbucking principle, and so I thought if I can apply that to the pickup, there might be something new and better that people might like.', 'Did you use parts from another pickup?', "RB: No, I just made it from scratch. The first one that I made and showed Chet, it didn't have screws—it just had metal pieces on top, like a single strip of metal, handmade, a magnet between them, and the coils I made out of pasteboard or something. I put it on a used Gibson ES-125 that I'd taken in on trade with somebody. It was low impedance, because I didn't have any way to wind coils, to wind thousands of turns, so I think I put about 200 turns on it.", "I got a little mic transformer in line, put it between the pickup and the guitar. I didn't have any tone controls on it at that time, just whipped it up to the guitar, and there it was. Chet liked it. I put it into the old DeArmond housing, because I didn't have any covers at that time, so they were there, they were made. The first ones I did with Chet I did like that, without the cover.", 'Do those plates at the side make any tonal difference?', "RB: Oh, I don't know, it's kinda theoretical. If you made two and compared them you might not be able to tell the difference.", 'Later they took the plates off in the middle.', "RB: The theory was that there were eddy currents. Have you heard of that? If there's any kind of bulk metal brought into the magnetic field, the magnetism tends to cause currents to flow. Therefore, anything that's in a closed circuit would do that. I figured that this metal housing around these screws, if that was solid there, then there'd be an eddy current effect—it would be like a closed loop around the pole pieces. So I figured that if I broke it, put a gap in there, then they would cancel each other out. That was the thought. Whether it did or not, I don't know [laughs].", 'Anyway, my idea was to use the humbucking principle and adapt it to making a pickup. You take a transformer, you cut a slot in it, and you got two poles. Otherwise it would be continuous—you cut a slot in it, then that separates the poles, and then the strings can have an effect on it, which otherwise they wouldn\'t have. Now you\'ve got a pickup or a generator or whatever. I made a model, took it down to Chet, and he liked it. He said, "Sounds great," and he told Gretsch he\'d like to use it on the guitars.', "Gretsch wanted to make the pickup themselves—they wanted the tooling. The basis for that, which I understand, was that they wanted to be sure of having supply. I hadn't done any manufacturing, I wasn't experienced at it. What they were afraid of was that they might need pickups and I wouldn't have them ready. I can understand their concerns. So I agreed to that.", '[Ray pops into another room and comes back with some pickups and other items.]', 'When we first got to communicating about the pickups, what Mr. Gretsch wanted to do was to handmake working models, copies of my pickups, in the factory. This was to verify them, so that he knew everything was how it should be, that everything worked.', "This here was a bobbin that they made in the factory up there in Brooklyn, made out of vinyl, polystyrene, or something. They were proofs, because Gretsch was pretty careful about things like that. He didn't like to make mistakes. Here's one of the pole pieces, that's all my idea, some of the models I had sent. This particular one is a laminated pole piece, made of layers, and then there were some that were solid, also.", 'Who did you deal with at Gretsch?', 'RB: I dealt with Fred Gretsch Jr. They were in Brooklyn, New York, I think the third floor up in an old loft building there. Not too big, but they did a lot in there. They made drums, guitars, banjos, and everything else in that space.', 'What happened when you went to see Gretsch for the first time?', "RB: Well, Chet had told them that he'd like to use my pickups in the guitars, so just over the telephone, I guess, we set up a meeting. I went to New York and went to Gretsch there, met Mr. Gretsch—Fred Gretsch Jr.—and we discussed it. 'Course, Jimmie Webster was in on the deal, too. We worked real closely with Jimmie.", "So we came to an agreement on a royalty basis. I furnished all the information and everything to make the pickups, and they went out and got tooling made. 'Course, they already had plating facilities—which they did with band instruments, all the other parts they made, metal parts of drums and so on—so they had everything to work with there.", "In the early beginnings, Gretsch said in their catalogue that they have these new pickups and how they searched countrywide to find the top engineers to design them [laughs]. I'm the one that did it! All that's just a big bunch of bull [laughs]. Anyway, that's what they put out at that time. They—I suppose they had their interest. They gave it the name. I didn't give it the name. They called it Filter'Tron, and they had a HiLo'Tron—all these names were theirs.", 'Now, look, I have a [\'60s] catalogue here, let me read it to you: "Introducing the new Gretsch Filter\'Tron electronic guitar heads. Filter out hum, neon noise, crackles." Now here it is: "The finest engineers in the country were engaged in the development of the Filter\'Tron and their main object was …" [laughs], yes, all those engineers—that was me!', "What happened, Ray, after you'd made the agreement with Gretsch for the Filter'Tron pickup?", 'RB: We made the agreement, so we took it from there. I furnished all the drawings and information and models of the pickups, the parts, the bobbins, the case, all of that, and from that they had tooling made. I had already contacted a molder to mold the bobbins, and they used that same one. I contacted a source for magnets: The first magnets came from Arnold Engineering, they were up north.', 'Then I was to serve as a consultant. That was part of the deal. Not just on the pickups, but anything about the guitars. When they first started putting the pickups on the guitars, one of the first things they had a little bit of a problem with was acoustic feedback, from the guitar to an amplifier, if you got too close. I figured out what was causing that, and I made a suggestion.', "I said in an electric guitar, you don't really need the same things that you do in an acoustic guitar, it's a different situation. I said the way to stop the feedback and probably get better sustain and better performance is to run the neck all the way through the guitar, and fasten the top to the neck, and do away with all that vibrating.", "See, the feedback was coming from that top vibrating with the pickups on it, mounted to the top. When you put on that neck solid, straight through, and fasten the top to it, it's locked in and it can't vibrate. So that solved that problem.", 'And then later, Chet came up with a design for a guitar which was basically a semi-solid guitar, and it had the artificial f-holes—that was one of the first ones he made that had the artificial f-holes. I was out at his house when he was working on that. I know we went and got some superglue when he was putting those f-holes on there [laughs]—he glued those f-holes on top of the guitar.', '[Ray takes a pickup from the pile of items he brought in.]', "Along the way I made this stereo pickup for the White Falcon—I designed that. That was Jimmie Webster's idea, he asked me to do it.", 'How did that work?', 'RB: Oh, it was basically quite simple. Just take my humbucking pickup and split the windings. Normally, you have one winding that covers all six strings, and if you just cut it half in two, you have two separate sets of windings: You have three strings that are independent of the other three. You just bring these out separately with their separate controls, and plug them into separate amplifiers, so when you pick the first three strings, it comes out this amp, and the last three strings come out that amp.', "I've seen some Gretsch stereo guitars where you have two sets of three pole pieces on one pickup and the other two sets of three on the second pickup. So there are several versions.", "RB: The first ones that I made for them, you couldn't really tell by looking at it, it looked the same because the separation was done internally. So just looking on the top of the pickup you really couldn't tell.", '[Ray goes out again and comes back with a gutted Gretsch Silver Jet testbed guitar to show me, with wires hanging out of it and a large board attached to the lower half with more wires and switches.]', "That's interesting, Ray. What was that for?", "RB: Well, there's nothing special about that, I just told Gretsch I needed something I could experiment with, and they sent me that. It's an unfinished model. It was just for general experimentation. I used it for working on the Gretsch stereo guitars and for other purposes, too. I experimented with different control arrangements on that panel on it there—I changed that around—the panel made it convenient to work with.", 'When did your relationship with Gretsch end?', 'RB: Our relationship officially ended in 1975. That was after Baldwin owned the company. I was sent a letter informing me that they would no longer pay a royalty after such and such a date in 1975.', 'What reason did they give?', "RB: Well, my patent application had expired. But that's not really the way it was supposed to happen. See, Mr. Gretsch and I had a handshake agreement, and to convince me that it would be OK, he had volunteered several pieces of information. He told me that they had done business with K. Zildjian in Turkey, the cymbal manufacturers, for over 50 years with no written agreement, and the same with Couesnon band instruments that they sold, made in France. He had been doing business with them for years and had no written agreement. He told me they were as good as their word.", "Which is fine, as long as he's alive, but when you die, well [laughs], you know, all that ends, and that's what happened. So it worked out fine as long as Mr. Gretsch was alive [Fred Gretsch Jr. died in 1980]. When they sold the company to Baldwin [in 1967], I kind of fell out the picture. In the meantime, they had moved to Booneville, Arkansas [in 1970]. When they moved to Booneville, well—they probably lost a lot of their key employees in one go. That can ruin a company. You lose your key employees, you're in bad shape.", "At the time Mr. Gretsch was alive, his secretary took care of all my royalties and everything. So when the company was sold, Baldwin just sort of forgot about everything. I finally got after them and they sent me a little money. Actually, Duke Kramer sent me a letter—he was still connected with Gretsch—and he said they felt it no longer applied, or whatever. But Mr. Gretsch had implied that our agreement would actually not have any end date. But that's all right, I never did feel too bad about it.", 'Did you make much money from it over the years?', 'RB: Not a lot. One time I worked for Sam Phillips, when he had a studio here in Nashville, about 1963, about the time The Beatles were getting hot. You know, of course, at one time they played Gretsch guitars, using my pickups too. And that was—', "AB: And that's when he made most money, when The Beatles used them!", "RB: I can tell you what I was supposed to have been paid. I expect they beat me out of a little bit. I was supposed to have been paid two percent of the factory selling price of the guitars, OK? And in return for that, I was to supply them with consultations, which I did a number of times. They would write me letters about this and about that, and I'd supply an answer.", '', 'Who would write to you?', 'RB: Primarily Mr. Gretsch, most of the letters were from Mr. Gretsch or from Jimmie Webster sometimes. The factory manager at that time was a man named Harold Woods, a very nice man and a fine gentleman. I really liked him. And Jimmie Webster of course, I liked Jimmie—Jimmie was fine. Bill Hagner was the head of production or something in the factory, production manager maybe. There was a Mr. Strong who was head of their finances or something, I remember him. Those are the main ones I had contact with. Jimmie Webster would write, and I would get letters from Mr. Woods about some technical thing, and Mr. Gretsch himself.', '', 'And did you have any communication with Gibson about their humbucking pickup, which Seth Lover came up with around the same time as yours?', "RB: You know, Gibson and I had a few words about that. I received a letter from Mr. McCarty, who was head of Gibson, in Kalamazoo, Michigan. I don't remember when it was I got it, but anyway, the letter was saying that we're informed that Gretsch is going to make a humbucking pickup or something, and we'd like to inform you that we have a patent pending on such and such a humbucking pickup, and that we'd like for us to cease and desist from whatever we were doing.", "Of course, I wrote a letter back to Mr. McCarty, and I told them that I didn't feel they had anything up on me at all—that I feel I was first with it. I had kinescopes [an early form of TV recording] of Chet playing a guitar with my pickups on it back in 1954. In a magazine I have, he [Seth Lover] claims to have invented it in 1955.", 'Mr. Gretsch called me or I called him about the situation, and what happened was Mr. Gretsch got in touch with Mr. McCarty at Gibson over the phone. They discussed the matter and decided to let each go his own way without the other one challenging. I thought that was OK, and that was the way it happened.', "It says on the patent that your patent for the Filter'Tron was filed on January 22, 1957, and issued on June 30, 1959. Seth Lover's patent for the Gibson humbucker was filed June 22, 1955, and issued July 28, 1959.", "RB: Gibson filed first for their patent, before I did, but patents are not granted on the basis of filing, they're granted on the basis of conception—when you conceived it. That's the way it is in this country. I know it's different in other countries, but here it's conception that counts, and I had the proof of conception. I feel I had better documentation than they did, and consequently I think that's why they decided to let it go, to not challenge it. So it was an agreement made on the telephone.", 'A patent runs for 17 years from the date the patent\'s issued. It\'s retroactive to the date of application, but it runs for 17 years from the date of issue. It\'s based upon who\'s first. Mine was issued before Gibson\'s was. Not much, a few weeks, but still, it was first. But they filed their patent before I did. What it\'s based on is conception, and I had better documentation. I remember when it came about. I called my patent lawyer. He said, "Well, we\'ll run interference on it"—that\'s when they go back and check the documentation and everything and compare it.', "AB: When you went to Gretsch, Ray, it was 1955, wasn't it?", "RB: Well, I hadn't applied for a patent when I first went up there. I didn't file for a patent until after I'd made an agreement with Gretsch, and then I decided I ought to file a patent.", 'Did you ever meet Seth Lover?', 'RB: I never did meet him, no. I have no idea about how he did what he did.', "He was an electronics engineer for the Navy, and then he joined Gibson in the early '50s. A little later he came up with their humbucking pickup.", 'AB: We do have an idea about Gibson. That well-known guitar player, Ray, who was with Gibson, he came in your shop and went out back, looked all through and asked what you were doing.', "RB: She's talking about Hank Garland, and I don't think he had anything to do it with it whatsoever.", 'AB: He was in our store and he asked Ray could he look at it, he turned it all around and upside down, and Ray took him in the back, showed him how he built them.', 'RB: I think Seth Lover and I, actually, we probably independently came up with it.', 'That happens, two people come across the same idea.', "AB: We don't know, though. It looked mighty suspicious to me.", 'I don\'t think Gretsch ever described your design as a "humbucking" pickup, did they?', 'RB: Well I\'ve got a Filter\'Tron leaflet here. It says it will "filter out hum."', 'Yes, clearly they used the word "filter."', 'RB: Yes, and it was supposed to do that—"cancels out hum"—so that\'s the humbucking process. And then all this gobbledegook they put in there about engineers and all, that was just a bunch of crap they made up [laughs].', "You know, I never really had any official position with Gretsch. We just had an agreement. They paid me a royalty—that was all there was to it. The relations that took place was just me and them. They never associated me with anything, in their literature, advertising, anything else. You know there's people to this day don't know that I ever had anything to do with Gretsch pickups.", 'About the Author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music.

With its recent reissues of the RG550 series and the unveiling of the brand new AZ series, Ibanez seems to be tipping its hat to not just its own history but the climate that created it: the era of Kramer dominance and the "Super Strat."', "When it comes to '80s guitars and the '80s as a decade culturally, it has at times been an acquired taste, to say the least. In 2018, however, it is becoming apparent to guitar players around the world that the '80s were a time when a lot of amazing guitars were made. From Fujigen's roots as the heart of both Ibanez and Fender Japan to ESP's role in Kramer production, it was a decade of global collaboration.", "It could be argued that this era saved the guitar industry as we know it today thanks to the vast innovations and improvements in design, production methods, and quality control. With that in mind, we are taking a look at Ibanez's most recent offerings and their roots in the '80s—the decade of shredders.", "One of the big highlights of NAMM and Ibanez's 2018 display was the debut of the AZ series. In a lot of ways, it is perhaps one of the most historically informed and interesting series to come from Ibanez in a long time. The body and headstock shape hearkens back to '82/'83 Ibanez models, but reworked for the modern player. Specifically, the AZs automatically bring two early '80s guitars to mind: the Ibanez Roadstar II and the Kramer Pacer.", "It is, to my eyes and hands, essentially an updated, modern take on the non-locking versions of those guitars, with deeper cutaways and a modern-futuristic contoured back and heel. To fully understand this series, let's revisit the history and historical influences behind it.", 'Ibanez Meets the Super Strat', "Coming out of the '70s into the '80s, Ibanez was in the middle of what was essentially a branding crisis. Throughout the previous decade, Ibanez was largely known as a copycat company with its Japanese-made Fender and Gibson knockoffs, until legal pressure brought that era to an end. Even though, by '83, the company was making original models, Ibanez did not have a distinctive identity or a hallmark guitar.", 'Eddie Van Halen, Kramer, and the "Super Strat" were taking over the guitar world by brute force—and Ibanez was at risk of being left behind as just another lawsuit brand of the past. Guitarists and guitar companies all over were experimenting with locking tremolos, more aggressive pickups, and new pickup combinations to meet the needs of post-Van Halen rock music and heavy metal. At the same time, the most notable original model for Ibanez after the infamous 1976 Gibson lawsuit was the George Benson Signature model—a jazz guitar. Branding issues aside, sales were slowing into the early \'80s.', 'By 1983, the Kramer Pacer and Baretta were revolutionizing the guitar industry. With their use of the new Floyd Rose locking tremolo system and their implementation of unconventional pickup combinations on high-quality Strat-style guitars, players were able to get new sounds and employ new techniques on stock Kramer guitars, instead of having to modify their Fenders. With Eddie Van Halen as their posterboy, Kramer was quickly gobbling up the electric guitar market and almost every legacy company within its wake.', 'To keep up with Kramer and the evolving needs of the modern guitarist, Ibanez knew they had to introduce models that would appeal to a certain kind of player—and to do so, they needed players to popularize the instrument.', "Enter the Ibanez Roadstar II, aka the RS series. Introduced in '83, it was at its heart a vast series of stylish super Strats that ranged from budget-level bolt-on models to signature models with birdseye maple tops, all the way up to a near-boutique neck-through offering. Having evolved from the earlier Roadster series, the Strat-inspired Roadstar II came with vintage Fender-style neck shapes, a modern fingerboard radii, a number of pickup options (H, HS, HH, HSS, SSS) and choice of hardtail or tremolos (with options for traditional non-locking or locking trem systems).", "Ibanez quickly got the new model into the hands of some of the premier guitar heroes of the day, including studio legend Steve Lukather, fusion icon Allan Holdsworth, Gary Moore— and, of course, the foremost '80s guitar hero, Marty McFly. Despite these notable players and in spite of the quality of the guitars—these were essentially sister guitars of Fender Japan via Fujigen, mind you—the Roadstar II didn't exactly set the guitar world on fire.", "Even with its later debut of the beloved Edge Tremolo, the Roadstar II never was a leading instrument of the era in terms of popularity. Overwhelmed by Kramer's market dominance in 1986, sales had drastically slowed for Ibanez in the U.S. to dangerous levels.", 'In The Ibanez Electric Guitar Book, Hoshino USA CEO, Bill Reim told noted guitar writer (and Reverb contributor) Tony Bacon about Ibanez\'s U.S. sales and operations at the time: "We got to the point where we were shipping maybe only 50 or 60 guitars a month. … The morale was so crushed. But some of us started noticing a movement out there that we weren\'t involved in, a whole school of young new players that we should be working with."', 'That brings us to the guitar that just received its latest reissue—and the leading artist of Ibanez.', 'The respectable thing about Ibanez in their modern form is that they know what their longtime fans want. While other legacy companies have actively abandoned formal reissues and been accused of losing the plot in terms of design, Ibanez in 2018 is sticking with the things that won players over in the first place on its new models and reissues.', "Case in point: the new RG550 reissues. If you've have played the company-defining originals or the fast-selling 2007 and 2013 reissues, this guitar will feel instantly familiar. Outside of the changes from a one-piece maple neck to five-piece maple/walnut necks (which have been present on every 550 reissue) and the updated V7 and V8 pickups that have been used since 2013, the guitars are remarkably similar to the 1987-'94 originals.", "To get a better sense of why these guitars are so beloved to the history of the company and Ibanez fans around the world, let's take a trip back to where we left off.", 'Ibanez Takes Over/The Rise of Vai, the JEM, and the RG550', "Going into 1987, USA and Japanese Hoshino executives decided that they needed to get real about Ibanez's brand identity and their new models. One of the unanimous conclusions that these executives had was that the brand needed a signature artist that personified the guitars they wanted to build in a way that Eddie Van Halen had for Kramer in previous years. The other immediate conclusion was that the player in this case had to be former Zappa protege and David Lee Roth guitarist, Steve Vai.", "Immediately, Ibanez set out trying to woo Steve Vai in hopes of being able to finish a signature guitar by NAMM in June 1987. According to Steve himself at the time, Ibanez wasn't alone, but they were the quickest to act and the most responsive to his needs.", "Per The Ibanez Electric Guitar Book, Kramer and Yamaha were trying to work on a signature guitar for him as well, but in Kramer's case they ultimately were more focused on making Steve feel like a rockstar in public instead of actually making him a fully customized guitar in a timely manner.", 'On the other hand, he received back his first custom JEM prototype from Ibanez within three weeks and, according to Steve, it was "better than what I wanted." That says a lot about the prototypes, as Steve had a huge hand in designing the JEM and was responsible for many of its key innovations—including the "Monkey Grip" handle and HSH pickup combination.', 'With the addition of the disappearing pyramid inlays, and the now famous "Lion\'s Claw" bridge routing, the JEM was ready for its debut. NAMM \'87 came around and the Ibanez display was shrouded in mystery. By the time of the JEM\'s unveiling ceremony, a huge crowd of guitar enthusiasts and industry professionals had surrounded the booth including the Kramer team.', 'Rich Lasner remembers in Bacon\'s book, "You could see all the guys from Kramer … who had pretty much been kicking our ass for the last couple of years with Van Halen. They were standing there with their arms folded, wondering what on earth\'s going on. We dropped the black cloth, and there\'s a giant poster of Steve Vai playing the JEM. Everyone applauds. I look over at the Kramer guys. Their jaws are on the floor, and they\'re walking away. That to me was a moment of, like, Wow! We actually may have done this. You know? We did something here."', "Upon its release, the JEM was a smash hit for Ibanez—helping establish the company and Vai at the forefront of the guitar industry. This all coincided in the Summer '87 with the new RG series and the RG550, which was in a lot of ways co-designed by Steve Vai. Initially, the RG series (stands for Roadstar Guitar—see what they did there?) was a mixture of older RS-series Roadstar style bodies with new point-style Ibanez headstock and thin necks.", 'The crown jewel of this series was the RG550. Over the next couple of years, the old RS/Roadstar bodies style would be phased out. They were briefly replaced by a Satriani signature-like redesign of the body—predating the Satriani models—before the Roadstar name formally went the way of the dinosaur with Kramer by the end of the decade.', 'The RG550 in many ways is a JEM stripped of many of the signature JEM-isms. Everything is essentially the same except for the lack of a "Monkey Grip" handle, Lion\'s claw, and brightly colored pickups. The vibrant colorful finishes and renowned shredability of the JEM are largely still there, of course.', "The RG series, specifically the RG550, would go on to be a massive success, arguably even bigger than the guitar it was based on. It has spawned off into innumerable re-interpretations and continues to be one of the most, if not the most, beloved series in the Ibanez line. Attesting to the success, Steve Vai noted that he once read statistics stating that the RG was the second best-selling guitar of the modern era, behind only the Fender Stratocaster. Not bad for a shredder guitar and a 'lawsuit' brand.", 'About the Author: Casey Hopkins is a Brooklyn-based writer and songwriter/guitarist for The Advertisers.

After a failed attempt at stripping the finish, Schenker had the guitar repaired and finished with the classic black-and-white look, simply because he wasn't sure which he'd like better.

Realizing what he had found, the fan contacted Wylde and the two were reunited.', "Today, The Grail stays safely at home with Zakk and is still used to record in The Black Vatican, Wylde's home studio.", 'Before Pantera hit it big, Dimebag Darrell was a local legend in Texas, shredding "more experienced" players at every guitar competition around. One of the prizes he won at a particular competition was a maroon-colored Dean ML that was later sold to help fund the purchase of a yellow Pontiac Firebird.', "The new owner brought his ML to band practice where bandmate Buddy Blaze traded him a Kramer for the Dean, recognizing it as Darrell's.

By combining the 8-string design with a low-output Lundgren M9 pickup and bass-like 29.4" scale length, you\'re left with instruments that are perfectly crafted for a down-tuned rhythmic assault.', 'By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive exclusive offers & promotions, news & reviews, and personalized tips for buying and selling on Reverb.', 'Your purchases help youth music programs get the gear they need to make music.', 'Your purchases also help protect forests, including trees traditionally used to make instruments.', "Hey!

He's played Ricks since 1964, so that's hardly a surprise. However, he won't be playing any of his Byrds-era Rickenbackers because, like many musicians whose careers have spanned decades, most of those original guitars are long gone from his possession.", "Back in the early '60s, Roger (then called Jim McGuinn) was about to change the name of his group from The Jet Set to The Byrds. He'd been playing acoustic 12s, at first a Stella, then a Gibson that Bobby Darin had given him after accidentally destroying the one Roger was using in Bobby's stage backing band.", "The Byrds were heavily influenced by The Beatles, and Roger shoved a pickup in his Gibson in an attempt to approximate George Harrison's luscious 12-string sound. But it didn't seem quite the same, somehow. Then came A Hard Day's Night, which appeared on movie screens across America in August '64. It offered Roger and his chums a closer look at all the Beatle hardware.", '"One night, we all went down to the Pix theatre in Hollywood to see A Hard Day\'s Night," Roger tells me. "We carefully noted the brands and models of their instruments. John had a little black 325 Rickenbacker, Paul had a Hofner bass, Ringo played Ludwig drums, and George had a Gretsch six-string and a Rickenbacker that looked like a six-string—until he turned sideways. The camera revealed another six strings hidden in the back. I knew right then the secret of their wonderful guitar sound. It was a Rickenbacker 12-string!"', 'That view of George\'s instrument came about 13 minutes into the movie, as The Beatles mimed to "I Should Have Known Better" in the mail-van on a train. The camera offered closeup if fleeting views of the Rick 12\'s unusual tuners arranged in two planes. More clues came later as the group fooled about on a TV set with "If I Fell." Roger and all the other fascinated guitarists who studied this Beatle movie were of course without YouTube clips or even freeze-frame DVDs. Instead, they made multiple visits to the picture house. And it was clear to the eagle-eyed Byrd that this was no regular six-string electric.', 'Later, the group\'s manager arranged for an investor to lend The Byrds $5,000 to buy new instruments. "We went down to the local music shop," Roger says, "and bought a Rickenbacker 360/12, along with a Gretsch six-string and a set of Ludwig drums. The new instruments gave us a sense of confidence that we hadn\'t had up to that point."', 'You\'ll be aware that there are two well-known \'60s Rickenbacker two-pickup 12-string models: the 330/12, with dot markers; and the slightly fancier 360/12, with triangle markers. You\'ll also know that the 360 was offered in two body styles: with an "old style" square-edged body or a "new style" rounded body-front edge.', "Roger's first Rickenbacker—let's call it Number 1—was a stock new-style 360/12, in other words, with that rounded body-front. It was made by Rickenbacker in October 1964, and Roger probably got it the following month, when The Byrds signed their deal with Columbia Records. The guitar was in natural finish, the type Rickenbacker calls mapleglo, and it had the regular two pickups, plus five controls and a selector switch.", 'He used the 360/12 Number 1 on The Byrds\' first single, "Mr Tambourine Man," recorded at Columbia\'s Hollywood studios in January \'65, alongside session players for this debut session, and it was released in April. Dylan\'s lyric included that most perfect (and now most clichéd) description of the Rickenbacker 12-string sound: "jingle jangle." He continued to play it through The Byrds\' first year of gigs and recordings, and it\'s all over the \'65 albums Mr. Tambourine Man and Turn! Turn! Turn!.', 'For a classic cut featuring Roger and Rick, try "The Bells Of Rhymney" from Tambourine Man (released June 1965), with its mini-orchestra of Eastern-sounding electric 12s. When he reaches the short solo, Roger lifts his trebly guitar above the drone for a moment, then settles back down again. It showcases well his ability to build the perfect mood with his electric 12.', 'While you\'re at it, listen to the impressive third single (released October \'65), with the title track from Turn! Turn! Turn! as its A-side, and another pealing celebration that peaks with a twin-12 solo as Roger picks and slides around the G-string. The B-side is "She Don\'t Care About Time" (for some unfathomable reason left off the album), where he quotes Bach in another perfectly succinct solo.', '"The Rickenbacker 12-string with the aid of electronic compression in the studio gave us the distinctive \'jingle jangle\' sound that we would later be known for," Roger recalls. Compression originated in the studio, designed to limit the potentially wide dynamic range of a recording to match the limitations of existing recording media. Soon, though, compressors were being used as an effect, drawing on the way they could make loud sounds quieter and quiet sounds louder to provide a result that sounded smoother and with longer sustain.', 'Roger reckons the sound of a Rick 12 by itself is "thuddy" and without much of a ring, but he recalls how the engineer at Columbia, Ray Gerhardt, would run compressors on everything to protect the studio\'s precious equipment from loud rock\'n\'roll, and this technique alerted Roger to the way a compressor could benefit his 12-string sound. "That\'s what gave me my jingle-jangle tone," he says. "Kind of squashed down, but it would jump out of the radio."', "In February '66, Roger modified Number 1. He asked Rickenbacker to add a third pickup, giving the look of the firm's model 370/12, and also had them install controls in a new layout he'd designed. The rewired result had three knobs in a curving line (a volume for each of the three pickups), one knob above (master volume), and two selectors (a three-way selecting each pickup and a tone-option switch).", 'Roger enhanced the sound of his guitar on-stage by adding a Vox V806 Treble Booster, a small box designed to sit between guitar and amp and provide what Vox described as "super extra glass-shattering treble." He learned about the gain increase the Vox box could provide from Jefferson Airplane\'s guitarist Paul Kantner, another keen Rick 12 fan. Roger added a small flick-switch to turn the booster on and off, situated next to the selectors in his revised control layout.', 'Unfortunately, Roger lost Number 1. "It was while we were performing at a college in New York," he remembers, "and I think I borrowed a fireglo 360/12 until I could replace the first one with another \'rounded\' mapleglo model, in 1966. I also added a Vox treble booster to that one, and it became my main guitar." (Number 1 turned up later and was sold to the Experience Music Project, Paul Allen\'s enterprise in Seattle known today as the Museum Of Pop Culture.)', "McGuinn's guitar in fireglo—Rickenbacker's name for its red finish—seems to have been a brief stopgap, a 360/12 with regular features that he got in early '66. In June that year, he acquired what we'll call Number 2, a new mapleglo Rick three-pickup 370/12 that replaced Number 1. Again, he asked for his special custom control layout. He used Number 2 from then until early 1971, playing it on a further sequence of great recordings and concerts.", 'He replaced that roadworn guitar with another custom-wired 370/12, Number 3, which Rickenbacker made for him in June 1970. (Number 2 also surfaced later and was sold at an auction at the Dallas Guitar Show in 2004. Roger has Number 3, which at some point was modified back to a regular control layout, and he says it is “currently on loan to Marty Stuart”.) Roger had a few other Ricks at the time: he acquired a 1970 12-string "lightshow" guitar with slanted frets, Rickenbacker\'s model 341/12SF, and a few years later he got a model 362 six-and-12-string double-neck.', 'The Byrds had a Fender electric 12-string, too, the solidbody Electric XII model, which Roger says he used occasionally in the studio. You can see Gene Clark playing it during a rather fuzzy YouTube clip of one of the group\'s early TV performances of "Mr Tambourine Man," with Roger and his Rick 12 (Number 1) alongside. How odd for the group\'s tambourine man to play guitar on this of all songs. Or perhaps that was an in-joke?', "Jump forward almost two decades, and Roger's signature-model Rickenbacker appeared in 1988, a 370/12 with new-style rounded-front body, in a limited edition of 1,000.", '"When Rickenbacker\'s president John Hall called me to ask if I would be interested in participating in a limited-edition signature series, I was delighted," Roger says. "He asked what I wanted in my guitar. My first request was for an electronic compressor circuit to give my live performances the sound that we\'d gotten on the Byrds records."', 'His other request on the signature guitar was for a 12-saddle bridge, a first for Rickenbacker.', 'Jump to today, and Roger will be playing one of his signature Rickenbacker 370/12RME1 guitars for the Sweetheart Of The Rodeo shows, alongside fellow founder Byrd Chris Hillman and backed by Marty Stuart & His Fabulous Superlatives. "Yes, I\'ll be using my Rickenbacker signature model," Roger confirms. "Chris will play his Martin signature guitar, and Marty will be playing Clarence White\'s B-Bender Tele." Sounds like the Sweetheart gigs should be a real treat for guitar fans—even before these guys play a note.', 'More on the McGuinn/Hillman/Stuart Sweetheart Of The Rodeo tour dates came be found here.', 'About the Author: Tony Bacon writes about musical instruments, musicians, and music. He is a co-founder of Backbeat UK and Jawbone Press. His books include Rickenbacker Electric 12-String, The Bass Book, and The Gretsch Electric Guitar Book.

But after ruminating on 35 years of phone calls, emails, and transactions, I made a list.", 'What follows is not a roll call of the "popular," but instead a list of pricey, hard-to-find, and ultra-rare models. I name this lineup, "WOW."', "Trying to order these gems from great, to greater, to greatest would be difficult and almost criminal. So I've listed the drums below in alphabetical order.", "This highly innovative drum was invented by Billy Gladstone, a percussionist at Radio City Music Hall. During a performance, he became inspired by the design of the roller skate screw. Soon after he applied its mechanics to create a unique drum tensioning system that could simultaneously tune top and bottom heads—or each head separately—from the topside of the drum, without having to turn it upside down. Gladstone further used his ingenuity to design the drum's micro-adjustable muffler, controllable vent, and elegant but simple throw off. He built only about 50 snare drums, many of which did not survive.", 'The Leedy Drum Company used their roster of endorsers in a way that had never been done. They laid out 212 endorser autographs in a geometric grid strewn with five-pointed white stars, then overlaid that design on a background of blue Pyralin plastic. They named it "Autograph of the Stars." In recent years, two variations of the finish have surfaced; one with gold sparkle stars instead of white, the other with no stars and a white pearl background. Leedy\'s 1941 catalog touted that drums adorned with the finish would lend ". . . more personality, punch, character, and pride of ownership than any . . . ever before." Yet few were made making them extremely rare. It\'s unknown whether lack of popularity or intentionally limited production was the reason.', 'Photo Note: we chose the photo on the right only to show the "Autograph of the Stars" finish. Shortly after its release in 1941 the finish disappeared from Leedy\'s catalogues then reappeared years later on the this drum with the Leedy/Ludwig badge. This suggests that a remnant of the finish had been found and used after Leedy had merged with Ludwig in 1950. At times, drum makers used discontinued and leftover components on new drum models.', 'Its acoustical punch and character qualify this drum as one of the best sounding vintage snares ever. Add the aesthetic appeal of a hand-engraved black nickel finish shell, plus contrasting lacquered brass hardware, and you have one very irresistible snare drum. Although Ludwig called it the "DeLuxe," it\'s better known as the "Black Beauty," a name borrowed from Slingerland\'s 1928 Black Beauty. The DeLuxe, like the plain nickel finish model, was uniquely constructed with an air chamber inside its half-inch welded bearing edges and a two-piece brass shell welded at the center bead.', "Early models were scroll-engraved; later ones were flower-engraved. Ludwig also made a six lug model, and although rarer than the 8 and 10 lug versions, it's not as desired or as valued by collectors.", "The Gold Triumphal was Ludwig's absolute top of the line snare drum. Not only was the entire drum plated in real gold, but also the shell, rims, and tube lugs were ornately hand engraved. The designs varied, featuring leaves, scrollwork, and rose petals. The drum was available by special order only. It's estimated that less than a dozen Triumphals exist; only about nine have been found. The Triumphal has the same two-piece heavy brass shell construction as the Ludwig Black Beauty.", 'Combined scarcity and an unusual mix of warm power, articulate response, and textured tone make the 6.5"x14" a real treasure. Ludwig formed the drum shell from strips of rolled brass welded together in a vertical seam. Rims were also brass. Shell Finish options were chrome and lacquered brass—the latter being extremely rare. In 1960, Ludwig introduced the 6.5"x14" size and produced it small quantities for only a few years. Prior to 1960, a 5"x14" was the only size Ludwig Super available.', 'I asked Jim Catalano who worked directly with William F. Ludwig II as the company\'s Director of Marketing from 1983-2013 why they stopped producing both brass snare drums models. He said, "As recalled from conversations with Bill Ludwig II, the 6.5"x14" size was not popular in the early 60\'s. Plus the rising cost of brass at that time contributed to the decision to discontinue both sizes. In addition, we could no longer get the right gauge of brass for the shell from our brass suppliers."', 'No other vintage snare drum better captured the culture of its day when entertainers wore white gloves, twirled canes, and waved top hats. Ludwig accomplished this with a striking and unique finish filled with musical notes, top hats, canes, and gloves, all diagonally overlaid on white pearl. They named the finish "Top Hat". In their 1940 catalog Ludwig noted that the design was "actually a part of the pearl itself and not pasted on or painted on the outside." They reissued the Top Hat finish in celebration of their 90th anniversary with a limited run of 180 snare drums and three full drum sets.', 'Little did the Ludwig Drum Company know that Feb 9, 1964, would establish their Oyster Black Pearl drums as iconic collectibles decades later. On that day millions tuned in to see The Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show and watched Ringo Starr drum on his Ludwig Classic Oyster Black Pearl finish drums. As for the Jazz Festival model snare drum he played, no other snare in history has, as yet, achieved such a degree of celebrity-generated demand.', 'In 2002, I had the privilege of interviewing William F. Ludwig II for a DRUM! Magazine article. Reflecting on the past, Mr. Ludwig said to me, "No one thought of vintage drums or collectors when we were making all of those drums back then. I never dreamed I\'d be talking to you now about all of this [so many] years later."', 'Rogers\' iconic Dyna-Sonic was not only a milestone in drum innovation but is still one of the most sensitive snare drums in existence. It\'s "floating" parallel-action snare wires were mounted in a frame that allowed them to be horizontally tensioned without putting pressure on the resonant head. This prevented the strainer itself from choking the head. The result was a remarkable playing response, tonal projection, and wire sensitivity.', 'Rogers produced the Dyna-Sonic in both brass and wood shells. According to some sources, only a few thousand wooden models were produced, and of those, very few were the 6.5"x14" size. In 2017, after a long absence, the Rogers Drum Company re-opened its doors and is again producing this remarkable snare drum.', 'The sheer beauty of this drum just takes your breath away. With clips over double flanged rims, brass Artgold hardware, and a triple-beaded hand-engraved black nickel finish shell, I rate this drum among the most beautiful vintage snares of all time. As of this printing, only about 15 are known to exist, two of which have come through our shop. One of the previous owners told me that he had fished the drum out of a dumpster. I was dump-struck! In spite of the shaggy quarters, it survived unscathed and came to us in excellent+ condition.', 'This drum will dazzle your ears. Endowed with a rich, "fat" tone distinctly its own, the 1-ply maple Slingerland Radio King is especially sought-after by studio musicians and recording engineers. There were several models in the "Radio King" snare drum series, all highly desirable, but the eight-lug 6.5"x14" white marine pearl Gene Krupa is the most desired. Slingerland named it after world-renowned drummer Gene Krupa who is credited for catapulting drummers into the limelight.', '"Slingerland Radio King" is prominently engraved on the top rim of each drum. I\'ll always wonder if the title were intended as a tribute to the radio, the center of entertainment in the home during the 1930\'s "Golden Age of the Radio."', 'Ned Ingberman is the founder and owner of Vintage Drum Center.

Below, musician, producer, and Hendrix gear dealer David Brewis shares some stories about some of the legend's wayward guitars, effects units, and other gear he's come across in his profession, including a Jazzmaster he's currently selling.", 'Jimi Hendrix used a range of musical gear during his short career, and some of that gear had to wait to be discovered after decades of being somewhere else. When this gear does turn up, often it will travel on to other owners, and then… well, who knows where?', 'Here\'s a selection of Jimi\'s gear that comes into that category of a "Slight Return," and all of them I\'ve either found, bought, or verified—and usually then sold through the Rock Stars Guitars, a business I run with Greg Dorsett.', "There's always another one. Or is there? And wait a minute, because some of these are somewhere else again. The cycle continues.", 'Featured since in many publications, this famous guitar was played live and on record by Jimi from mid-1967 through to early 1969, when he gave it to Mick Cox of Eire Apparent. You can hear it on "All Along The Watchtower," "Little Miss Strange" (recorded straight into the mixing board, according to Noel Redding), "Catfish Blues," and other famous Hendrix tracks, and you can see Jimi playing it on video on UK and USA tours.', 'Chas Chandler told me that at a gig in Belfast, Jimi threw this guitar at his Marshall cabinets as part of the show, missed completely, and the guitar went through a window at the back of the stage and was hanging outside by the guitar cord, feeding back. And still it never suffered a headstock break.', "When Mick Cox got it, he stripped off the psychedelic paint job that Jimi had applied in 1967, and then it was sold on through various shops and players (in the mid-'70s, for example, Duane Eddy's rhythm guitarist—possibly Roger Saunders—used it on TV on Top Of The Pops). I found the guitar, painted black, in Newcastle upon Tyne in the mid-'90s, with most of its original hardware and still no damage. I positively identified it by matching the wood grain with old photos. Amazing! I then restored it and sold it on to a collector, and it's since changed hands at least once.", "When Jimi was in the Army in Nashville in the early '60s, he used this very rare, low-production guitar, with its factory Epiphone vibrato. It was photographed at various shows—including at the now-demolished Jolly Roger club—and had additions of stuck-on fake block inlays made from white plastic tape. Eventually, its pickguard, truss rod cover, and other parts were painted white to give it an upscale and showy Custom-type look.", 'The guitar was never photographed with Jimi after he left the Army, but it turned up in the mid-2000s through a couple of dedicated collectors and guitar archeologists, who found it somewhere in Tennessee. I had to fly from the UK to Memphis for a day to help authenticate the instrument, and it was then sold to a collector. It still had lots of traces of the white paint from Jimi\'s "upgrades."', 'There was no documentation of a serial number or anything from the Jimi days, but it was such a rare vibrato model—with its unusual white paint additions and an altered top nut for a lefty player—that it had to be the same guitar. The wood grain did appear to match up to those period photographs, too, which was reassuring.', 'Jimi used these hefty, huge cabinets on his 1968 U.S. tour, and they\'re visible in pictures of the stage at various gigs (including the "Newport 69" festival held at Northridge, California, in June \'69), usually alongside Marshall stacks. There were six Showman cabs originally, and they were powered by Dual Showman heads. These were the days when all of the guitar sound came from the backline and vocals went through the PA system.', "Slightly later, the cabinets were powered by Fender Twin combos, as extensions. During the tour, they must have passed through the Fender factory for a service or upgrade, as they were retrofitted with 15-inch JBL speaker units, and an appropriate JBL badge was added to the front of each one. Perhaps the original Jensen speakers didn't last long with full-power Showman heads running through them? It's clear that the Fender factory did the work, as its date stamp (during 1968) is visible all over the interior of each cabinet once the back is removed, which itself isn't an easy job, as there are lots of tight-fitting screws.", "Two of these cabs were in storage in New York from the late '60s until 1994, when they were sold through Bonhams auction house in London, along with other instruments, clothes, and goodies belonging to Jimi. They were in remarkably clean condition, with the waterproof covers. I bought the two from the auction, one of which later went to Experience Music Project in Seattle, while the other is still in stock.", 'This guitar is mentioned in Caesar Glebeek\'s book Electric Gypsy as a Gibson Les Paul with a too-short serial number. The original receipt does show this, describing it as an "outfit," meaning a guitar with matching amplifier and case.', "An American collector found a Gibson Les Paul Custom from around 1969 with this same partial serial number. The thick black lacquer finish had totally covered the rest of the number, so it was unreadable. Jimi reputedly gave the guitar away while it was still brand new, and the guitar showed heavy wear and tear from a right-handed player. It was sold via Robert Johnson, the guitar collector from Memphis, to a private collector around 2003. Bonhams sold Jimi's matching Gibson Les Paul amplifier in 1994.", "Mentioned in a couple of books about Jimi, this Martin D-45 was made in the first year this high-end model was reissued with Brazilian rosewood back and sides, and only 229 were made in 1968 and '69. It remains a highly desirable model on the collector's market today.", "Jimi's D-45 was sold by Mitch Mitchell through Sotheby's auction house in London in the '90s, which is how I bought it. The guitar had always been strung right-handed, unlike most of Jimi's guitars, which were converted at the nut to be re-strung in reverse.", 'I had conversations with two singers and musicians from the musical Hair, and they confirmed that Jimi was seen at a London party with this guitar around 1969, playing country songs and fingering the chords in reverse, playing right-handed. I sold the guitar through Rock Stars Guitars to the Experience Music Project in Seattle (now the Museum of Pop Culture).', 'Ever wondered what made the sound like a ship\'s bell on the masterpiece that is "1983" from Electric Ladyland? The answer turned up in a bag of \'60s percussion instruments from Jimi\'s studio gear that appeared in the 1994 Bonhams sale. I didn\'t buy any of it at the time.', 'In the bag were claves, a triangle, shakers, and a Flex-A-Tone—"a new sound-effect instrument" introduced by the Carroll company of New Jersey early in 1968. Carroll\'s promo material said the Flex-A-Tone "is played by shaking to cause wooden balls to strike a tempered spring. Tone may be varied by flexing the spring varying degrees with the thumb," adding that it "may be played with one hand."', "When recorded, it sounds like the bell on the Hendrix track, but slightly higher pitched. However, when slowed down using varispeed techniques (usually by recording with the tape machine running faster than normal), it becomes recognizable as the exact sound of the mysterious ship's bell.", "If you've also wondered about the noises on the track that sound like seagulls crying, that is Jimi pulling his studio headphones away from his ears and causing feedback through the vocal microphone. Creative, or what? The track is full of impressionistic sounds and effects, and it ends with tape delay panned left to right, sounding like a futuristic aircraft.", "I bought the Flex-A-Tone from an Australian collector many years after the original sale, and I sold it on to one of the world's largest collections of instruments. Jimi didn't need a guitar—and sometimes not even an instrument—to make beautiful sounds.", 'Jimi really liked Jazzmasters, having used them on the road with Wilson Pickett and other soul acts before he became famous, and occasionally he used them with the Experience. He had a few, at least, and they are hard to track precisely.', 'Except one, that is, which belonged to Billy Davis, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee who played with Hank Ballard on the original version of "The Twist." He also worked with The Isley Brothers and Jackie Wilson: Billy played that amazing riff on "It\'s Your Thing," and he\'s on "Higher And Higher" alongside a moonlighting James Jamerson. He\'s still playing today at age 80.', 'Billy was hanging out at Jimi\'s apartment in 1969 playing Jimi\'s \'64 Jazzmaster, and when they went out to a club, Jimi said, "Don\'t forget your guitar," and gave it to him. Billy had a shop convert the nut back to a right-handed setup. That guitar is still around, currently held securely by us at Rock Stars Guitars (more info at our Reverb shop). We have a couple of videos of Billy talking about the guitar\'s Jimi connection and of him playing it. Jimi gave Billy two more Gibsons, an ES-335 and an SG (exact models unknown), but those are long gone.', 'This early multi-effects unit, made by the American innovators Maestro, combined such effects as octave, fuzz, and auto wah filter, and also it offered triggered percussion sounds. It allowed the guitar signal to have effects applied or to trigger sounds such as claves and maracas.', 'The guitar side of the Rhythm \'N Sound is quite good, and may have been used on the studio version of "Star Spangled Banner," as it has a very similar tone, not at all like a Fuzz Face through an amplifier.', "I seem to remember a pot date of January 1969, which I noted when looking at the innards of this unit in '94 with an engineer who helped me replace a fuse or some other component (and yes, it works fine now). It was originally offered through Bonhams in 1994 from the New York stash, and I have not used it since but kept it for display or museum use. It's rather like an organ console and cannot be operated as a pedal with your feet, which does rather limit its use to the studio as opposed to the stage.", "Noel Redding bought this six-string bass in Manny's in New York City, brand new, around May '67. Noel was originally a guitar player and tried this model to see what he could get out of it. He soon went back to his Fender Jazz Bass for most of his work, but he kept this bass around.", 'When "1983" was being recorded in New York, Jimi played the bass solo on this instrument. Noel wasn\'t at the session, but he told me his gear was in the studio—his Jazz Bass, the VI, and his Gibson J-160E—and so Jimi apparently gave the VI a try. And it worked.', "Later, Noel tried stringing it as a regular guitar, but that didn't work for him either. In 1999, when I was visiting him at his house in Ireland, I asked where the VI had gone, and he said he couldn't remember. He called a few days later and said he'd found it—under the kitchen table. Would I like to buy it? Yes! A few weeks after that, Noel found the original instruction booklet that came with the guitar and posted it on to me. Currently, the Fender VI is on loan through Rock Stars Guitars to the British Music Experience in Liverpool, where it's on display.", "About the Author: David Brewis is a musician and producer (The Kane Gang, Prefab Sprout) who has been involved in Hendrix collecting since he bought a Gibson J-200 from Jimi's manager Chas Chandler in the mid-'80s.

The amp takes the electrical signal from the guitar’s pickups and gives it power, and the speaker then takes that power and converts it into sound waves that can be heard by the listener.', 'A key player in the history of guitar speakers is the British brand Celestion, featured in classic amplifiers from Vox to Marshall to Orange to Selmer.', 'The story of Celestion begins in 1924, in the thick of a radio industry boom. At the time, many manufacturers were looking to improve the quality of their equipment, and using Celestion speakers proved to be a popular way of doing so. This popularity grew even more in 1932, when the company introduced permanent magnet technology, making their speakers easier to assemble and use.', 'In 1948, after Celestion was purchased by Rola, the focus of the company switched to supplying speakers for more “luxury” items such as stereo audio systems and an emerging new technology called television. It was also at this time that Celestion began working on a new model of speaker, one that would reshape the sound of music.', 'Production for this new model, the T0530, began in the late ‘50s, and was based on a high-end speaker originally made in 1936. It would come to be known as the “Celestion Blue,” so named because of the bluish tint it had after blue paint was added to the black chassis in 1960. This 12-inch diameter speaker was equipped with an Alnico magnet, specially designed to meet the demands of the early electric guitar players.', 'The Celestion Blue proved to be immediately popular. When combined with high-volume valve amps, the speaker offered a uniquely warm and easily distortable sound, producing a tone that earned it worldwide fame after it was adopted by the Beatles in their ubiquitous Vox amps. The creamy tones produced by the combination of Celestion and Vox came to be one of the defining characteristics of 1960s British rock.', 'With their new found popularity in the rock world, Celestion speakers soon became adopted by another brand that would come to dominate rock and roll—Marshall.', 'When rock bands began to outgrow theatres and instead started performing in larger venues, amplifier manufacturers started to develop evermore powerful amps. With these new spaces in mind, Celestion started work on the G12, a model designed to deliver more power and different impedance options to satisfy the demands of stadium rockers and festival stages.', 'These new powerhouse amplifiers, equipped with Celestion speakers, became the go-to for some of the most legendary musicians of the time, including Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, the Rolling Stones, and Van Halen.', 'From 1968 on, the company utilised an array of modern materials that enabled them to develop speakers capable of handling more powerful amplifiers, such as the G12-65 and G12T-75 models.', 'Starting in the early 2000s, Celestion has reissued classics such as the Blue Alnico, Gold Alnico, and the entire Heritage series, and while many of their newer models are produced in China, these legacy speakers are still manufactured in the Celestion factory in Ipswich in the UK.', 'The company continues to innovate, regularly introducing new loudspeaker models such as the Neo Cream, which features a Neodymium magnet offering incredible performance for a reduced weight or the G12H-150 that offers a classic sound but with 150-watt handling.', 'The brand has also started to offer impulse responses (a digitally modelled version) of their speakers to users who forgo traditional amplifiers entirely and use software to generate their guitar sound.', 'With so many legendary manufacturers and groundbreaking artists choosing Celestion speakers, you have to wonder: What would rock and roll sound like without this company from Ipswich?', "Thanks to Celestion's John Paice for helping with the writing of this article.

Mostly he used just his Martin acoustic with Fishman pickups and his Chewie II Monsta Looper custom pedalboard, which enabled the ginger Godzilla of gadgetry to loop his guitar and voice and to add effects that made him sound more like an orchestra than one bloke with one box.', "While Sheeran's achievements have been astounding, and despite whatever legions of his devotees might think, he did not invent the concept of the one-man band. Delving back to the 13th century, there are records of street musicians who simultaneously played a three-holed flute and a drum. By the early 19th century, versatile individuals were knocking up an entertaining racket using fiddles, panpipes, a bass drum, and a tambourine.", 'A blind London-based street musician, his name lost in the mists of antiquity, told the social researcher Henry Mayhew in 1850 that the unreliability of the members of his first band led him to invent a wheeled cart to which he fixed 14 bells.', '"I had hammers fixed on a rail, so as each bell had its particular hammer," he explained. "These hammers were connected with cords to a pedal, acting with a spring to bring itself up. So, by playing the pedals with my feet, I had full command of the bells, and made them accompany the violin, so that I could give any tune almost with the power of a band."', 'American musicians, too, were fascinated by the possibilities of creating machines which could make one man sound like an entire group. Fate Norris of Dalton, Georgia, was described in a 1927 newspaper feature as "the one-man wonder, who plays six individual instruments in an individual band. … Mr. Norris has in his band two guitars, bells, bass fiddle, fiddle, and mouth harp or kazoo."', 'Norris contrived his magnificent gizmo out of soapboxes, planks, pegs, pedals, strings, and kneepads surmounted by a large cogwheel, at which he sat bowing his fiddle with his kazoo clenched between his teeth.', 'As the 20th century proceeded, further homemade contraptions such as the fotdella and the piatar or pitarbajo ushered in the extraordinary musicians we now think of as classic one-man bands. Blues singer and songwriter Jesse Fuller, best known for his much loved "San Francisco Blues," tinkered the fotdella together in the early \'50s to introduce more variety into his solo performances.', "Fuller's fotdella looked like an upright bass with six strings, which were struck by hammers that he operated by using his right foot to manipulate pedals. His left foot, meanwhile, pumped a clattery hi-hat cymbal and, as if this wasn't hard enough while picking his guitar, he also played a harmonica and a kazoo which were strapped round his neck on a wire frame. His ragtime-y bass lines fell somewhat short of virtuosity, but the dexterity required to co-ordinate Fuller's various instruments has rarely been matched before or since.", "Country music instrumentalist Joe Barrick, a well-known figure around Oklahoma in the '50s, invented his bizarre piatarbajo, which cannibalised aspects of piano, guitar, bass, and banjo, all mounted in a rack, which he operated with his feet to provide solid rhythmic backing. The 14 footpedals also gave Joe access to a snare drum and a tambourine for additional percussive impact. Meanwhile, he kept his hands busy delivering rudimentary melodies on his double-neck guitar and mandolin, while also singing or playing harmonica.", "Another popular innovation for aspiring one-man bands at this time was to mount a big bass drum on their backs, played by means of beaters attached to their elbows, but the wire-frame harmonica holder was even more widely adopted by '60s folk music stars, from Bob Dylan to Donovan.", "Even jazzers, including the blind innovator Rahsaan Roland Kirk, explored the possibilities of playing multiple instruments throughout the '60s. Kirk would ascend the stage with three saxophones around his neck (and sometimes a flute or two). He could play a melody line on one sax with a simultaneous accompaniment on another while adding percussion on a cymbal at his feet. He was also known to make use of gongs, alarm clocks, sirens, and lengths of garden hose.", 'The folk boom led to a new popularity for busking, and the sight of one musician playing guitar and harmonica was fairly common. It was probably inevitable that one of them would hit the big time.', 'The lucky man was Don Partridge who, inspired by Jesse Fuller, started working as a one-man band. He won a contract with Columbia Records in 1968, which resulted in no fewer than three British hit singles. Partridge strummed energetically on a 12-string while banging a big bass drum on his back through cords attached to his feet, embellished with tambourine jangles attached to his elbow, and taking the occasional solo on kazoo or harmonica.', "The next step was to use the rapidly advancing technology of the late 20th century to create virtual one-man bands. In 1970, folk singer John Martyn started running his acoustic guitar's pickup through a fuzzbox, a phase shifter, and an Echoplex tape delay to create a multi-layered, looped sound that can now be seen as a predecessor of Ed Sheeran's style. Robert Fripp's Frippertonics analogue delay system, first employed in 1972, enabled him to create multi-layered guitar compositions through an ingenious configuration of looped tape running between a pair of reel-to-reel audio recorders.", 'From this point, electronics replaced mechanical marvels as the chosen means to create a one-man band. The range of sounds and the number of instruments that could be used by just one player became vastly greater than was hitherto possible, but what was largely lost was the ability to reproduce the results live. The one-man band, for a while, became a studio-bound phenomenon. The zenith of this approach came with the multi-platinum Tubular Bells, in 1973, which used the overdubbing potential of a contemporary recording studio to turn the 19-year-old Mike Oldfield into a veritable guitar orchestra.', 'I have a fond memory of seeing the German electronic composer Klaus Schulze at his concert in the London Planetarium in 1977, during which he built up sequenced parts on his array of synthesizers—and then walked off the stage leaving the machines to play by themselves. Just a few years later, Thomas Dolby was scoring hit singles by releasing electronic pop songs and promoting them live by playing solo electronic concerts.', 'The leap from Dolby to Ed Sheeran has taken almost 40 years. But in essence there\'s little difference between them. Dolby was considered avant-garde by pop standards, and the sounds he made were cutting edge at that time. Perhaps Sheeran\'s greatest achievement has been to humanise the machinery that makes his performances possible, and sell this to an audience who\'ve become increasingly familiar with electronically generated sounds. Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston may have scored a huge hit with "It Takes Two" in 1966, but the simple truth is that, really, it has only ever taken one.', 'About the Author: Johnny Black is a music journalist and author of over 40 years experience, having written for Q, Mojo, Smash Hits, and many others.
